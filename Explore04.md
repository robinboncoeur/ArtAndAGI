# Exploring Four

## Stepped Over

I made sure my lucky tie was knotted perfectly before I walked into work. Today was the day the COO announced the new Director of Accounts. I'd been working my ass off for months to get the job and I just knew that today was the day it was going to pay off.

I'd been working for the company since I was 22. Now I was 35 and I'd barely moved up the ladder at all. I'd started as an Accounts Agent, and after toiling away for years I'd been promoted to Supervisory Accounts Agent. That had turned out to be a meaningless title since the only changes were a minor salary bump and the responsibility of training new agents.

I'd been starting to think I'd wasted my life at the company when the department director position opened up. As the longest-serving team member, I was the most suitable for the position. Nobody had anywhere near my experience. Nobody knew the department like I did. The job was as good as mine.

I stepped into the office and I dumped my bag down next to my desk. After 13 years I didn't even have my own office, I was still out in the bullpen. I looked up and saw Evie heading toward me. Evie was one of the recruits I'd trained. She was 19 years old and ridiculously attractive. She was also the type of girl who knew how hot she was. From the day she'd started, she'd given me the impression that she thought her looks would carry her through life. I'd been deliberately hard on her to knock her down a peg or two. She needed to learn how the world really worked. She needed to know that she'd be toiling away at the bottom for years before she even caught a glimpse at the foot of the ladder, let alone stepped on it. It didn't matter how pretty she was.

She stopped at my desk and handed me a stack of papers. Her long blonde hair was styled perfectly and her tight pencil skirt hugged her curves in all the right places. Her large breasts were practically spilling out of her pink blouse, and I found myself wondering if they were real or if she'd had work done. She was too young to have had surgery already. The thought of feeling their weight in my hand sent a shiver down my spine, but I quickly shook it off. She was about half my age and thoughts like that were inappropriate. Especially since I was going to be her boss by the end of the day.

"What's this?" I asked, dumping the papers on my desk and flopping down into my chair.

"The Beswick account history you asked me to prepare yesterday," she said, her tone a little short.

"Oh, yeah, maybe if you'd gotten them to me yesterday when I'd asked for them I'd still need them," I said. I picked the papers up and shoved them back into her hands. "I don't need them anymore. Take them back to the archives and grab me a coffee on your way back."

Evie tutted loudly before stomping away across the office. I didn't technically have any authority over her but she'd had to follow my orders when she'd first started and she hadn't realized she could refuse even after a year of working here. By the time she did figure it out I would be her boss and it would be too late. She'd be following my orders forever.

I watched her leave, her shapely ass swaying provocatively with each step. For a moment, I let myself indulge in the thought of what it would be like to have her bent over my desk, her skirt hiked up, and her pink blouse discarded on the floor. Maybe when I controlled her salary she would be willing to give me a ride. I knew there was no chance of that happening now, my harsh treatment of her had bred only resentment for me.

She returned a few minutes later and placed a cup of steaming coffee on my desk. She put it down so hard that some of the liquid spilled out and pooled over my paperwork.

"Oh, Evie, careful!" I said, grabbing a tissue to clean up the mess.

"You could always make your own coffee," she said, glaring at me.

"Careful, Missie. In a few hours I'll be the department director and if you ever want to see a pay rise you'd better remember to be respectful," I warned her.

"If that happens I'll just quit."

"And you'll need a reference from me to get another job. I'll blacklist you with every company in the city," I replied, offering her my saltiest smile.

That seemed to shut her up. She bowed her head and shuffled away towards the archives without another word. I watched her go, my thoughts already drifting toward my first day as department head. I was so excited that I barely did any work all morning.

After lunch, the COO, Harvey Spencer, stepped into the bullpen and demanded everybody's attention. "As you all know the Director of Accounts position has been vacant for some months now. Our longstanding supervisory accounts agent, Jack Turner, has helped handle the management responsibilities during this time which myself and the other executives are very grateful for." Harvey bowed his head and smiled at me.

I was beaming with pride and my heart was pounding with anticipation. As Harvey continued speaking, I zoned out and let my mind wander. This was the moment I'd been waiting for. A huge power shift and a massive pay bump. I could afford to move to a nicer apartment, maybe even a house. I could live somewhere I wasn't embarrassed to take a woman back to and then maybe I could end my stretch of bachelorhood.

But then, Harvey's next words snapped me back to reality. "I'm pleased to announce that after careful consideration, we've decided to promote Evie Thompson as our new Director of Accounts."

My breath caught in my throat. This couldn't be happening. I must have misheard him.

Harvey smiled, unaware of my shock, and continued. "Evie is an up-and-coming star within our company and I have no doubt she will excel in this position. I'm certain you'll all offer her your support as she transitions into this new role. Congratulations, Evie!"

Harvey clapped and then the whole office joined in, except for me. They were all congratulating Evie. I sat staring at her, trying to figure out how she'd down it. She only had a year's experience. She was too young. She must have slept with Harvey. It was the only way.

All this time I'd been talking about becoming her boss, I'd been saying it to her, almost taunting her. All this time she had been in the running against me and I hadn't even known it. But she had. She'd been silently biding her time, hoping that her efforts had paid off. And now, somehow, they had.

A lump formed in my throat as I watched Evie revel in her moment, safe in the knowledge that she had bested me. I knew that I should feel proud of her but instead, I felt a seething rage as my dreams of success and fortune were snatched away from me. Evie was far smarter than I'd realized, she was cunning. I had underestimated her and now I would have to suffer the consequences.

"Jack," Harvey said as I stopped by my desk. "I know you're disappointed and I get it, you wanted this job. I just don't think you're ready to step up just yet. But listen, you trained Evie so her success is your success. You should be proud."

"You don't think I'm ready, but you think she is?" I asked, pointing at the girl who had just been made my boss.

"She's a bright young woman, Jack. I dare say you'll be impressed by what she achieves. For now, focus on supporting her and helping her make something of this department and when you're ready, you'll be promoted too." He clapped me on the shoulder and then sauntered out of the office.

I glanced over at Evie and her eyes met mine and she smirked. It was faint, barely perceptible, but I saw it. She'd won and she knew it. She was now my boss. She could give me orders. Now everything was going to change and not for the better.

* * *

I kept my head down all afternoon and got on with my work. If I just did my job quietly and avoided Evie then maybe I could pretend that she hadn't somehow been promoted above me. I managed to pull it off for the rest of the day but the next morning I was not so lucky.

I was sitting at my desk when my phone rang. Before I even lifted the receiver I knew that it was her. I could just feel it like I could feel the growing ball of dread in the middle of my stomach.

"Jack," her voice was angelic and sweet. "Can you come to my office please?" She didn't even give me time to respond before the line went dead. I sat there for a few moments, trying to assure myself that everything was fine and I would survive whatever was about to happen. She was a professional in the workplace and she was not calling me into her office to gloat.

I stood up from my desk and made my way to her office, trying to ignore the twisting in my stomach. As soon as I walked in, she looked me up and down with a sly smile on her lips. "Close the door, Jack," she said, her voice dripping with her newly acquired authority.

I did as she asked and then took a seat in front of her desk. I couldn't deny my jealousy as I looked around at the office that should have been mine.

Evie leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms and pushing her breasts up so they were almost spilling out the top of her tight blouse. I hated the way this girl was looking down her nose at me like I was beneath her.

"So, I just wanted to make sure there were no hard feelings about me getting the promotion. I know you really wanted it and it can't be easy for you to have failed," she said.

I gritted my teeth, barely able to hold back my resentment. "I'm fine. It's just business," I said through clenched teeth.

"Exactly," she said, nodding. "And we learn our best lessons when we fail."

I didn't bother to restrain my sigh. She sounded like an inspirational Insta post. "I didn't fail, Evie. I was passed over for someone who isn't qualified for the job," I shot back, my eyes locked onto hers.

Evie simply shrugged her shoulders, her pouty lips curved into a smirk. "Well, I don't know about that. Harvey seemed to think I was the best candidate for the job. And while we're on the topic of qualifications and job roles, Jack, I wanted to talk to you about your position."

My skin prickled as I listened to her condescending tone. "I don't think there's anything to discuss about my position," I replied. "I'm perfectly content with my job and my responsibilities."

Evie's smirk only grew wider. "Oh, I'm sure you are. But that's not the issue at hand, Jack. You see, Harvey asked me to evaluate the department and identify areas where we can improve productivity and efficiency and all that. You are the only agent with the supervisory job title and as far as I can tell the only additional duty you have is to train new team members. Is that right?"

I raised an eyebrow, sensing where this conversation was heading. "Yes, that's right."

"Well, based on my own firsthand experience of your training methods, I don't think you're performing your duties very well," she said.

I leaned forward in my seat, feeling defensive. "Excuse me? Just because you were a bad student doesn't mean I'm a bad teacher."

"Well, I think it does and since I'm your boss my opinion is the only one that matters," she said, her voice filled with a menacing edge. "That's why I'm putting you on probation for the next two weeks. During that time, I'll be keeping a close eye on you to see if you can meet the standards I expect from my employees. If you can't, then we'll have to consider further action."

My anger was boiling inside me. I couldn't believe what was happening. I had always been a good employee, and now I was being reduced to a trainee. "This is ridiculous," I spat out.

"Calm down please, Jack. If you pass your probationary period then no further action will be taken. However, if you fail to meet my standards then you will lose the supervisory title and take a pay cut."

"How much of a cut?" I asked.

"Well.." She tapped a few keys on her computer and then stopped, eyes locked on the screen. A small snort of laughter escaped her lips. "Is that all you get paid?"

I felt my cheeks flush and my stomach plummet. If this meeting hadn't been bad enough already now she was mocking me for my low salary which she now had the power to cut. "It's not... I mean..." I spluttered, struggling to find a suitable response.

"Wow, to think that if you'd gotten this promotion your salary would have more than doubled. That sucks," she said, pouring more salt into the already throbbing wound.

"Doubled?" I said in a gasp. Humiliation tore through me. This 19-year-old girl who I had trained was earning more than double my salary and she was sitting there rubbing it in. "I'll just find another job," I said in a low growl.

"You'll need a reference from me," she said, repeating what I'd said to her yesterday when she'd threatened to leave if I got promoted.

I crossed my arms and clenched my jaw to stop myself from saying anything I'd regret. I could do nothing but sit in silence and fume as Evie smiled in triumph. Judging from the satisfied smirk on her face, she was quite pleased with herself.

"On the other hand, if you show me what a good employee you can be, maybe you can earn a raise. How does that sound?"

I gritted my teeth. "Fine," I said.

"Good," Evie said, her voice filled with smug satisfaction. "Then we're all set. How about you go a make me a coffee."

I winced. If I made her a coffee now then it would set a precedent. I'd forever be her coffee boy. Her errand-runner. She'd delight in giving me demeaning tasks forever. And yet I couldn't stand up to her. Not if I wanted a raise.

I got up from my chair, feeling the heat of her gaze searing into my back as I walked silently out of the room. My hands shook as I made the coffee, my mind spinning with thoughts of how I could turn things around. But as much as I hated to admit it, Evie had won.

After a couple of minutes, I brought her the steaming cup and placed it on her desk with a scowl. Evie looked up at me, her gaze steady and unwavering. "Thank you, Jack. Sit back down please."

"Shouldn't I get back to work?" I said quietly, trying to restrain my temper.

"Sit back down," she said sternly like she was a teacher talking to an unruly student.

I felt myself blush as I lowered myself into the chair. I gripped the arms of the chair tightly, my blood pumping aggressively through my veins.

"The more I think about, Jack, the more I think that your behavior toward me over the last year could be classed as bullying," she said.

"What?" I demanded in total disbelief. I might have been a bit hard on her but I'd never bullied her.

"You spoke down to me, insulted me, ordered me around, and even threatened me on occasion."

"I did not!"

"No? How about when you said you would refuse to give me a pay rise if you got promoted and then said you wouldn't provide me with a reference either?"

"Well, I was just..."

"I think I'm going to ask some of the other people you've trained if they have any complaints about your conduct. Perhaps you're not a good fit for this company after all."

My mind was racing as she spoke. Evie was going to take this to a whole new level. I had no idea what her end game was, but I knew that the tables had turned and I was no longer in control. I had no idea how conniving and manipulative she was. But I knew that arguing would achieve nothing.

"Evie, I know I was hard on you but I didn't mean anything by it," I said, swallowing as much of my anger and humiliation as possible.

She raised one perfectly styled eyebrow and regarded me with amusement. "Is that supposed to be an apology?"

I clenched my fists and looked down at the floor. I couldn't believe that I was apologizing to this girl. But I knew that it was the only way to save my job.

"I'm sorry," I mumbled. "Please don't fire me." Ripping off my own skin would have probably felt better than apologizing and begging for my job but I couldn't afford to get fired today. I wasn't the most financially stable man and I couldn't lose one job without having another lined up.

Evie lifted her coffee and took a big sip, smiling widely as she did so. I should have spat in it. That would have given me at least a slither of satisfaction.

"If you're going to beg, you should do it properly," she said slyly.

My heart sank. "What?"

"Beg properly. Get down on your knees and beg me not to fire you," she said.

I stared at her, flabbergasted. I had no idea she could be so vindictive. I mean, I knew she had a temper, but this was something else.

I clenched my fists so hard my knuckles turned white. I wanted to tell her off, I wanted to shout and scream, but, in the end, I didn't. Partly because I knew it wouldn't do me any good and partly because I knew deep down that she was right - I had been mean to her.

I slid off the chair and sank to my knees. It was the most humiliating moment of my life and I thought I was going to throw up.

"Please, Evie, don't fire me," I said, my voice barely audible.

Evie stood up. Her face held a cruel expression as she walked around her desk and stood directly in front of me. Kneeling on the floor, I had to look up to meet her smug gaze.

"I think this is a good lesson for you, Jack," she said. "You're learning your place. Isn't that right?"

I felt my cheeks burn as I nodded mutely. She continued to stare at me for a few seconds before crossing her arms and regarding me coolly.

"I don't believe you are sorry. I'm going to need you to perform an act of contrition," she said and I could hear the cunning in her words.

Finally understanding her plan, I looked up at her and nodded.

"Whatever you want," I said, an equal mix of hate and resignation in my voice.

Evie's lips curved into a cruel smile and I knew I'd just made a big mistake. It wasn't like I had any choice though.

"Kiss my ass," she said. She turned on the spot so her plump young ass was staring me right in the face.

My eyes grew wide and I felt my heart sink. I wanted to scream with humiliation, but I managed to keep my composure. Slowly, I leaned forward and pressed my lips against her tight buttocks. The fabric of her skirt was smooth against my lips and the thin barrier eased a small portion of my humiliation. She made a low satisfied sound as I reluctantly kissed her.

"There," I said, sinking back onto my knees, defeated.

"Hmm," she said thoughtfully. "No, that's not good enough." Evie leaned over and began to hike her skirt up. My eyes widened as I realized she wanted to make this even more humiliating. Her skirt rose, bit by bit revealing her round cheeks and the purple fabric of her thong. Her bum was without a doubt one of the best I'd seen, but being forced to kiss it was still a humiliation.

"Now you'll really kiss my ass," she said coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.

My mind was spinning, I couldn't believe this was happening. But I was too far gone to resist. With a heavy heart, I leaned forward and pressed my mouth against her warm, inviting flesh. Evie sighed smugly as I kissed her ass. I pressed my lips against her flesh hard, holding there for a while to make sure she was satisfied this time.

As my humiliation reached its peak I felt a familiar stirring in my pants. Fuck, seeing her bare ass and feeling it on my skin was turning me on. She was young and stunningly attractive so it was only natural. But she was still a raging bitch and I hated myself for enjoying this even a little.

"Both cheeks," she commanded.

I complied, kissing her other cheek, my heart pounding as my cock stiffened.

"Now, tell me you're sorry," she said.

"I'm sorry, Evie," I said, my voice low and apologetic.

"I'm still not convinced."

My jaw dropped and I remained on my knees staring at her perfect bum, wondering what else she was going to make me do. But I kept my mouth shut and waited for her next command.

She took hold of the waistband of her thong and slid it down over her rump. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My heart accelerated half in fear, half in excitement.

---

"Kiss my asshole like the bottom feeder you are," she demanded, planting her hands on her desk and bending over slightly.

My body shook as I dared to move closer. I reached out and parted her cheeks to reveal her puckered little star. My mouth had gone completely dry, but I knew I had to do it. I bent forward and pressed my lips against her hole.

"Do it properly," she said, her tone a warning.

Evie gasped softly as I kissed her asshole, my tongue snaking out to dart over her pucker. I could feel the quivering hesitation in my body, but I was determined to please her this time. I licked her ass slowly, lingering on her sensitive hole.

"Mmm, that's it, keep going you little bitch," she purred, arching her back and pushing her ass into my face.

My heart was pounding as I worked my tongue over her, my shame and arousal combining into a powerful wave of emotion. I was completely under her control, and it only made me hornier. Her scent filled my nostrils and I realized that my humiliation had now become lust. I gripped her waist hard and thrust my tongue deeper, licking her from the inside out.

"Go on, keep eating my asshole you pathetic little boy," she said, wiggling herself on my tongue. Her words ignited a deeper passion in me, one that I was powerless to restrain.

Evie let out a low moan that sent my already zooming heart rate into overdrive. I wanted to please her again, wanted her to know how powerful she was. I flicked my tongue faster, pushing myself to make her more and more aroused.

"Oh, yeah," she moaned. "You are nothing. Fucking nothing. You're not a real man at all, are you?"

Her words sent a thrill of shame and pleasure through me.

"No," I whispered, tasting her sweet, forbidden nectar.

I felt a kind of perverse pleasure at being so completely subjugated to her. I didn't even care that she'd gotten the promotion and put me in my place. This moment, experiencing such intense humiliation was worth it. Although I felt embarrassed, degraded, and powerless, being under Evie's control gave me a rush of delight I'd never known before.

"No what?" she demanded.

"No ma'am," I said, licking her harder and faster, my desire deepening with every movement of my tongue.

Evie let out a loud moan as I pleasured her. She had completely taken control of me and I'd surrendered entirely.

"That's right," she said, grinding her ass against my face. "You're nothing but a submissive little boy who's going to behave and do everything I say."

"Yes, ma'am." My arousal reached an all-time high and I felt myself trembling as I lapped her asshole with frenzied intensity.

"Good boy," she said, her voice dripping with satisfaction.

Licking her sweet ass felt amazing and I could feel the unbelievable power she held over me. I wanted to please her, to keep her aroused and satisfy her needs. I wanted her to feel the same blazing passion I was experiencing.

My cock was pushing against the fabric of my pants, begging to be released. Just as I reached out to touch myself, Evie let out a satisfied sigh and pulled away from me. I felt a pang of disappointment as the moment ended.

She pulled up her panties and fixed her skirt before sitting down at her desk again. "Have you learned your place now?" she asked me.

I looked up at her from the floor and nodded.

She raised an eyebrow questioningly.

"Yes, ma'am," I said, looking down in embarrassment. My cock was softening and taking the pleasure of humiliation with it. And yet deep inside me I was still eager to taste her again. God, her bum was so perfect. So delightful.

"Good. Now run along and do some work like a good little boy."

I pulled myself up off the floor and hurried for the door, rearranging my pants to hide the last of my hardness.

"Oh, and Jack," she added, making me pause. "From now on bring me my coffee every morning like a good little bitch. If you want to keep your job."

"Yes, ma'am," I said, feeling the heat rising to my cheeks in a mix of humiliation and anticipation.

"Very good," she said with a small smile. "Now, get back to work."

I scurried out of the office, my mind spinning with pleasure and shame. I had no idea what I'd just gotten myself into, but I knew I wanted more.

---
---

Each morning I arrived at work and made Evie a cup of coffee. I never spat in it for fear of her somehow finding out. I'd already seen how vindictive she could be and I had no desire to incur her wrath any more than I already had.

My new work situation wasn't so bad. Evie gave me loads of bitch work to do, like getting her photocopies, taking her mail to the mail room, and generally running errands, but she didn't humiliate me again like she had that first day.

I was sitting at my desk in the bullpen replying to my emails when I saw her office door open. Evie stepped out, looking prim and proper in a pencil skirt and tight-fitting blouse. Her hair was up in a bun, giving her a stern yet still attractive image. It was her eyes that caught my attention and not because of the smoky eyeliner she had on. She looked furious. And she was looking right at me.

"Jack," she said loudly enough to be heard right the way across the office. Everybody looked up from what they were doing.

"Yes?" I said, standing up to go to her office. She raised her hand and stopped me before I could step away from my desk. I had hoped to move whatever was about to happen to a more private setting. At least if she was doing whatever this was out here it couldn't be too bad. She could hardly force my face between her ass cheeks in front of the whole office.

"How long have you worked here?" she asked. She was grasping several sheets of paper in her angry little fist.

"13 years," I said.

She strode forward a step and raised the papers up to eye level. "Then why can you not fill out a simple B496 form correctly?" She threw the papers down and they dropped to the floor silently, a small metal clip the only thing stopping them from scattering across the office.

I stared at the incorrectly filled-out forms, unsure of what she wanted me to do now.

"I'm sorry, I didn't realize I'd made a mistake," I said. I'd been filling out those forms for years. There was no way I'd messed up something so simple.

"Your performance is not good enough," she told me, pointing aggressively across the office. I heard a couple of my colleagues snickering at the dressing down I was receiving from a girl who was almost half my age. One day it would be their turn and then I'd laugh at them and see how they liked it.

I felt my anger rising up my neck, bringing a burning redness to my cheeks. I gritted my teeth and replied. "I'm sorry that you find my performance unsatisfactory. I will try to do better in future."

Evie snorted. "Yeah, I bet you say that to women a lot." The entire office erupted into laughter at her words and I felt my soul shrivel up in embarrassment.

I could feel my blood boiling as I stood there, humiliated in front of everyone. Evie had already made it clear that she didn't like me, but this was a new low. This was pretty much bullying.

But instead of lashing out at her, I took a deep breath and held it together. I couldn't afford to lose my job, no matter how badly I wanted to tell her what I really thought of her.

"Do the forms again," she said, nudging the fallen forms with her foot.

I sighed, understanding what she wanted of me. Keeping my eyes low, I walked toward her and bent down to pick the forms up off the floor.

"Kneel," she whispered so only I could hear her.

I almost refused, but that would only make her escalate things. I sunk down to my knees and picked the forms up off the floor.

"Bring them to my office when you've done them right," she said. She turned and strutted back into her office, leaving me on my knees whilst my colleagues grinned and laughed at my humiliation. My how I had fallen.

I could feel the weight of my anger and frustration rise within me as I rose back up on my feet and walked towards my desk. My mind was spinning with a million thoughts, and all of them were focused on Evie and how I could bring her down. I knew there was nothing I could do. I just had to put up with her taunts until I landed a new job and I would be spending every minute of my personal time applying for positions elsewhere.

Annoyingly, she was right and I had filled in the forms incorrectly. I cursed as I realized my own sloppiness had caused that humiliation. I filled the forms out again and checked them 3 times before I carried them over to Evie's office.

I felt several eyes on me as I made my way across the bullpen. Before I'd been seen as a senior member of staff, now I was a laughing stock. I was the man who'd been passed over for a girl half his age and even less experience.

I knocked on Evie's door and waited for her to invite me in. As I walked into her office, my eyes were drawn to her stunning figure. She was leaning against her desk, her arms crossed over her chest, and a sultry smirk on her lips. My heart rate increased as I tried to focus on the task at hand- delivering the forms.

"Finally got it right, Jack?" she asked, almost purring.

I nodded silently, handing over the forms without making eye contact.

Evie took the forms from me and began examining them carefully. I could feel my palms start to sweat and my heart race as I waited for her verdict. Finally, she looked up at me with a small smile on her face.

"Well done, Jack," she said. "You've accomplished what everybody else managed on their first day."

She dropped the forms on her desk and then lowered herself into the chair that stood in front of her desk. "I've been reviewing the figures for the month and your numbers are a lot lower than usual."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. "Yes, well I've been running around doing silly errands for you instead of concentrating on my actual job."

"Don't blame me for your poor performance," she snapped. "Your decreased productivity is going to affect your bonus this month, I'm afraid. In fact, I don't see you getting a bonus at all."

I needed that bonus. I relied on it every month. I could afford to take a lower bonus, but not no bonus at all. I wouldn't be able to pay all my bills. My pulse hammered as I tried to calm myself down. "Evie, please, I understand that you don't like me but please don't mess with my money," I said in a pathetic whisper.

"Oh, Jack, don't beg, it's not manly." She smiled devilishly. "Actually, do beg."

My jaw dropped open in disbelief. Was she serious? Was she really asking me to beg for my bonus? The humiliation was almost too much to bear, but I knew better than to argue with her. She had all the power in this situation and I was completely at her mercy.

Slowly, I dropped to my knees before her. "Please, Evie," I said, trying to keep my voice steady. "I need that bonus. I have bills to pay and I can't afford to lose it."

She raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed with my effort. "Is that the best you can do?"

"Please give me my bonus. I'll do anything," I said. I'd never felt so pathetic in all my life.

Her eyes narrowed as she studied me for a moment before a wicked smile spread across her face. "If only I wasn't so stressed I might be more inclined to take pity on you. I just feel so much tension. Maybe you could help me remove some of that tension...by giving me a foot rub?"

She extended her leg and held her foot just below my face. I hesitated for a moment, my pride biting at me. But then I realized that pride wouldn't pay my bills. I took hold of her slim ankle and slipped her shoe off her dainty foot. She wore no stockings and with her shoe removed, her bare foot was in my hands. Her skin was soft and smooth not like my own rough-skinned feet.

Slowly, I began massaging her foot, working my fingers into the soft flesh at the bottom. She let out a small moan of pleasure, and I could feel my own arousal beginning to stir. I didn't even have a foot fetish so I didn't understand why this was turning me on.

Evie leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes as I continued my ministrations. "You're actually quite good at this," she said softly. "Maybe you should consider a career change since office work doesn't seem to be your forte."

I gritted my teeth, feeling the heat of anger and humiliation rising within me. But then she let out another soft moan, and all thoughts of anger fled. I continued my massage, a part of me wanting to draw another of those little moans from her mouth.

Without a word, Evie slipped off her other heel and held out her other foot to me. I took it from her without hesitation. I began kneading the arch of her foot softly, eliciting another moan from Evie. I worked my fingers more firmly into the flesh of her foot, releasing the tension in the muscles as she sunk into her chair.

"This is so nice, Jack," she said softly. "But not bonus nice, if you know what I mean. Kiss them."

"What?" I said in disbelief.

"You heard me. Kiss them." Her voice was stern. She would accept no refusal.

I leaned forward and planted a small peck on the bottom of her foot, just below her toes. It was pathetic but she was actually enjoying it. Evie glared at me, her eyes hard as stone.

"That's not what I meant. I know you can kiss better than that."

It was odd, but I would have preferred to kiss her asshole again rather than her feet. Somehow, feet seemed worse.

I leaned in closer, planting another quick peck on the bottom of her foot. "Okay, you're being a big pussy right now," she growled, giving me a look that dared me to disobey her again.

I swallowed hard and dropped a kiss onto the top of her foot. The warmth of her skin against my lips was shocking and it sent a shiver through my body. I kissed her foot again and again. Before long, I was kissing her foot all over, pressing my lips against every inch of it. My hands continued their massage as I moved from the arch of her foot to the toes. She raised her foot quickly, catching me off guard, and slid her big toe between my lips. I froze with her toe in my mouth.

"Good boy," she purred. "You're doing much better now. Keep it up."

I began sucking on her soft, pretty toe, enjoying the taste and the slightly ticklish feeling of it rubbing against the inside of my mouth.

"Fuck yes..." she moaned loudly. "You are such a good little bitch."

My face burned with embarrassment and anger, but I knew better than to argue with her or even react to what she was saying. I worked my lips against her dainty toes. Her foot was soft and warm, her toes sliding across my tongue as I worshipped at the feet of this powerful woman.

Evie wet her lips with her tongue, looking down at me. "What is that?" she asked abruptly.

I looked up to see that she was pointing directly at my crotch. A tent had sprung up in my pants, the outline of my hard cock pressing against my pants, visible to Evie.

"Looks like you're turned on by my feet," she said with a wicked gleam in her eye. "Let me see what you've got."

I stood up, burning with embarrassment. "Isn't that a bit too far?" I asked meekly.

"Show me. Now."

My mind buzzed with possibilities. She wanted my cock. Was I about to get a reward for the attention I'd given her feet? Was I about to see how spectacular her boobs looked without a blouse hiding them?

I gulped, then unzipped my pants, letting my cock spring out. My face burned as I revealed to Evie just how much she turned me on.

There was a moment of silence before she burst into laughter. "Oh, my God. Jack! Wow! That is without a doubt the smallest little cock I've ever seen. It's barely even a cock at all!" she said, laughing through her words.

"I'm not that small!" I insisted. My cock stood at a somewhat proud 5 inches. It was average--not small. I was a bit on the thin side but lengthwise was nothing too bad.

She rolled her eyes. "Let me put it this way - I'm not even sure if I'd be able to notice it if it were in front of my face. Seriously, there are guys in school packing more meat than you are. You're really not much of a man at all, are you, Jack?" Her laughter increased as she mocked me.

"Fuck you," I muttered, sliding my dick back into my pants and zipping it back up.

"That's one thing you will never do. You can have the bonus if only out of pity. Now go on, get back to work, you filthy little foot pervert," she said, dismissing me with a wave of her hand.

I returned to my desk feeling degraded and pathetic. At least this time I'd gotten something out of my humiliation. I'd kept my bonus even if I had debased myself to earn it.

---
---

Over the following weeks, Evie continued to treat me like a servant, and rather than standing up for myself, I got used to it and accepted my new position in the office. It was impossible not to notice my colleagues snickering at me whenever Evie, my 19-year-old boss, summoned me into her office. At 35 I was one of the oldest in the department, most of my colleagues were in their 20s. It had been okay before because I'd been a supervisor and I was in line for the promotion to department head. Now, I was nothing and I felt like a man who was far behind where he should be in life. I wasn't even on the same level as the youngsters, I was beneath them. I was a 19-year-old's bitch. Plain and simple. No matter how long it went on the humiliation never lessened.

Evie had me make her coffee, get her lunch, sort her dry cleaning, and she even made me clean her car once. She called me into her office to rub her feet and massage her shoulders. She only made me give her rim jobs or suck her toes when I was being punished and needed to be reminded of my place.

When I arrived at work one Monday morning I found Evie waiting at my desk. She was perched on the edge of my desk in a tight black dress that was low-cut enough to show plenty of cleavage. I'd be lying if I said I hadn't imagined what her tits looked like but I doubted I'd ever get to see them.

The smile on her face made me instantly suspicious and that's when I noticed that everything had been removed from my desk. The only things remaining were my computer and desk phone.

"Where are my things?" I asked.

Her lips stretched wider as she jumped off my desk and beckoned me to follow her. "I thought you should have a change of scenery," she said in a falsely sweet voice.

I followed her across the bullpen until we arrived at her office where I saw all of my things. They'd been placed on a brand new desk that stood directly outside her office door.

"It will be easier for you to assist me if you're closer to my office. Don't you think?" She looked at me, her gaze challenging me to argue. My job was not to assist her. I was a supervisory agent, that basically made me her number two.

"Yes, Evie. That makes perfect sense," I said, humble and respectful. I knew that my colleagues were smirking at me and I tried to ignore them. If I stood up for myself it would only get worse. There had already been talk of layoffs and I knew that the first excuse I gave Evie she would take.

"Good boy," she said cheerily and then vanished into her office.

I settled at my new desk. Whenever Evie wanted me she yelled my name rather than phoning me and if I didn't get in her office fast enough she came out and reprimanded me in front of everybody. I learned to move fast.

I was working my way through my email inbox when a sudden thud made me jump. A heavy file had been dropped on my desk.

"That's for Evie. It's the quarterlies for the Brekon account," said Brad. Brad was one of my least favorite people. He'd started about 6 months ago and despite being 23 he was more like a teenager. He always put in the bare minimum effort and talked back a lot. He was a tall, muscular guy and loved mocking guys who were smaller than him -- which was most of them. If I'd had the power to fire him, I would have done so.

"Why are you giving it to me?" I asked, pushing the file towards him.

He looked at me like I was an idiot. "Because you're her assistant," he said.

My jaw dropped and my cheeks burned red. "What? No. I'm not her assistant."

Brad grinned evilly at me. "Sure you're not. You just sit right outside her office like a good doggie and run around fetching her coffee and laundry because you're not her assistant. Right?"

There was no response to that. He was right, I was her assistant in all but title and I wouldn't put it past her to give me the official job title too.

He couldn't keep the malicious smile off his face. It seemed like he took great pleasure out of seeing me humiliated. He pushed the file at me again. "She needs this. Don't keep her waiting."

I glared furiously at him as he turned and strutted away. I didn't have to take that from him. Evie had authority over me. She controlled my salary, my bonus, and my very employment. Brad controlled nothing. And yet I said nothing as he wandered back to his desk. I just sat in my shame and watched him go.

I took a minute to cool my anger and then I snatched the file and took it through to Evie. I knocked on the door and waited for her invitation to go in before entering her office.

Evie was sitting behind her desk tapping away on her computer keyboard. She glanced up and looked at me as I entered. She wore winged eyeliner behind her glasses that made her look smoking hot. I hated that the young bitch could have such an effect on me. The whole ordeal would have been better if she was so attractive. Being aroused by how sexy she was only added to the embarrassment.

"Close the door, Jack," she instructed.

I did as I was told and walked to her desk to leave the file at her elbow.

"I wanted to give you something while you're here, Jack," she said. She stopped typing and swiveled around in her chair to face me.

"Oh?" It was all I could say. I was dreading what she had for me because I knew it wouldn't be good.

"Yes." The smile on her face was friendly enough but I could see the sinister intent behind it. "I've been thinking about your cock."

"You...have?" I said, suddenly confused. Was she...interested now? Had I somehow won her over?

"Not like that," she snapped," curling her lip in disgust.

"Oh." Whatever I had been feeling evaporated.

"I've been thinking about how small it is." She smirked at me as her words sank in. Embarrassment washed over me, nibbling my innards. I tried to suppress my shame but it was useless. "It really is the smallest I've ever seen. The more I think about it the more I think you're not much of a man at all. You're more of a girl in fact."

"I don't really think it's that small," I mumbled. I wanted to shrivel up and hide somewhere out of sight. It was clear that she just wanted to torment me and I'd come in here pretty much of my own accord for once.

"Here." She opened her desk drawer and pulled out a plain white cardboard box.

I stared at the box with suspicion knowing that there was nothing good inside. Nothing good at all. Whatever that box contained was just another tool to degrade and humiliate me.

"Open it." The command in her voice was clear.

I stepped forward and lifted the lid slowly, dreading what I was about to see. A layer of purple tissue paper covered what was inside. I reached to move it and a stone of dread formed in my stomach as I realized what was hidden even before the pink lace panties came into view.

"Take them out," she told me.

I reached in and took out the pink lingerie. The deliciously pink fabric felt soft and delicate in my hands as if it were made from silk. The delicate lace had a translucent quality that my eyes seemed to get lost in.

"You're going to wear these," she said, watching me with that cruel smirk again.

I looked away from her eyes, unable to hold the gaze of someone who took such pleasure in seeing me humiliated. "I...I'm not," I said. It turned out there was a line and she had just crossed it. After all the humiliation she had forced me to suffer, this was a bridge too far. I would not allow her to decide what I wore.

"Oh, I think you are," she said. She grabbed her computer monitor and turned it to face me. She tapped a few keys on her keyboard and a video started playing on the screen. I watched with horror as I saw myself kneeling on the floor of her office, her little toes in my mouth as I sucked on them eagerly. I was literally burning with anger and shame as I stared at the evidence of my debasement. "You will do everything I tell you to do or everybody will find this video in their inbox. And I have a friend in IT. He'll send the video from your email account so it will look like you made this video without my consent and then distributed it. That's not just a fireable offense, it's a crime. So, are you going to put the panties on?"

"I...I..."

"Are you going to put them on?" she snapped. Her face was firm and resolute, I just knew there was no way I could get out of it.

"Yes," I muttered in reply. The humiliation slapped me across the face as I realized the desperation in my voice. My shame was palpable as the words left my mouth.

"Good girl." She purred her approval, feeding off my despair. "Now get those boxers off and put on those panties."

"Here? In your office?" I asked, in disbelief. I didn't want to change in front of her.

"Yes, Jack. Now get on with it. I'm losing patience."

Seeing no other choice, I began to unbuckle my belt. I moved quickly, not wanting to elongate my humiliation any more than necessary. I pulled down my pants before removing my boxers. I tried to pull the panties on quickly but they were tight and took some persuading to get up my thighs. Evie snorted with laughter at my struggle. The lace felt soft and snug against my skin and I was ashamed to find that the meagre amount of material was more than enough to contain my penis and balls. Tufts of pubic hair stuck out the sides but my genitals remained tightly within.

"They suit you," she said when they were finally on. "Lift up your shirt and give me a twirl, baby girl."

Curling my lip in frustration, I did as she commanded. I lifted up the tail of my shirt and gave her a quick twirl so she could see the panties on me from every angle.

"Good. Now get dressed."

Relieved, I grabbed my pants and pulled them on, only feeling slightly more comfortable when I'd re-buckled my belt.

"Tonight make sure you buy more panties. From now on you'll only wear panties. If I catch you wearing anything else you will be punished severely. Do you understand?" Evie said, raising an eyebrow in smug authority.

"Yes, ma'am," I said, resisting the urge to argue with her.

"Good girl. Now go and get me a coffee."

I stomped out of her office and determined that I would have to find and delete every copy of that video. There was no way I could let this stand.

As I walked past my colleagues paranoia ebbed at me. I became convinced that they could all see that I was wearing panties even though it was impossible. They were covered by my pants. Nobody could possibly know what underwear I had on. Still, as their smirking eyes fell on me I felt uncomfortable and I longed to get away from their gazes.

I relaxed some when I was in the kitchen and I took my time making the coffee. I wanted -- no, I needed a few minutes to myself. A few minutes where nobody was watching me, smirking at me, laughing at me. I'd never felt so low in all my life. I felt like I might cry as I stirred the coffee. But I didn't. I knew somebody would catch me and I was humiliated enough.

Returning to Evie's office, I placed the coffee down on her desk but I slipped. The cup jolted and the steaming hot fluid spilled out and sloshed over the papers that were scattered over the surface of her desk.

"Ah, Jack!" Evie yelled. "Clean it up!"

I rushed back to the kitchen and grabbed some paper towels which I used to mop up the spilled coffee. Only a few of Evie's papers had been ruined; the ink had smudged and ran making the words unreadable.

"I'm going to have to redo that now," she told me. Her lips were pursed as her narrowed eyes roved over my body, no doubt trying to think of a way to punish me.

I clutched my hands behind my back and waited for whatever punishment the young girl came up with.

"Give me your belt," she said at last. "You've lost belt privileges for the day."

Confused as to where this was going, I unbuckled my belt and pulled it free from my pants. Evie held out her hand and I folded my belt before placing it gently in her palm. She stood up and hung my belt over the coatrack, like a huntress hanging the skin of an animal she'd slain.

"Get back to work then," she hissed.

I stood still, perplexed. That was it? That was my whole punishment? It was nothing. I wasn't stupid enough to argue. I spun on my heel and almost jogged out of the office before she changed her mind.

Evie left me alone for the rest of the morning. Even when I returned from my lunch break I didn't hear from her. It seemed that the confiscation of my belt was the only punishment and it wasn't a punishment at all. My pants were a tad loose because I was between sizes, but it wasn't enough to cause them to fall down. And as for the panties, well truth be told, I was starting to like the feel of the lace against my private parts.

I glanced at my watch as I made my way to the printer. It was just past 3 pm. Less than 2 hours left until I could go home and relax. My work days were so stress-filled now since I never knew when Evie might decide to torment me. I know that I wasn't always nice to her when I'd been in charge but I think she'd more than evened the scales by this point.

"Ugh," I sighed when I reached the printer and saw the error message. It was out of paper. The fresh reams were stacked across the office by Brad's desk. The last thing I wanted was to give him the chance to mock me, but I needed the paper. I'd just ignore anything he had to say.

As I approached, Brad smirked at me but he said nothing. I turned my back to him to get on with my task as quickly as possible. I grabbed a nearby pair of scissors and squatted down to open a box of paper.

"What the fuck, Jack, are you wearing panties?" Brad said loudly enough for the entire office to hear him.

My blood ran cold and I froze. Suddenly Evie's seemingly mild punishment made perfect sense. Without my belt, my pants had slipped down and revealed my panties. I should have anticipated that. How could I be so stupid?

"Yeah, Jack, are you wearing panties today?" Mark asked. "Oh my lord, he is." There was mirth in his tone.

Titters of laughter grew around me. I yanked a ream of paper out of the box and stood up quickly, turning around so nobody could see the top of lace panties that had been protruding from beneath my pants.

"It's not...you don't..." I struggled to come up with a suitable explanation, or even an unsuitable one.

"We should start calling you Jackie," Brad said to a roar of approving laughter.

In the depths of my deepest humiliation, the strangest thing started to happen. My dick started to swell. I tried willing it to stop but it was completely out of my control. Something about this shameful situation was arousing me. Was Evie's treatment of me unlocking a new kink that I had hitherto been unaware of?

I looked across the room and saw Evie leaning on her doorframe, smirking over at me.

Clutching the ream of paper to my chest I pushed through the giggling crowd that had gathered around me. I went straight to the bathroom and hid there for a good half an hour. I couldn't face my colleagues. Not now. They knew that I was... Well, I didn't exactly know what they thought. Just that I had a fetish for ladies' underwear I guess. They did feel nice against my skin, and I enjoyed the way they held my package so snugly. But it wasn't a fetish, and it wasn't by choice.

This had gone far enough. It didn't matter if some perverse part of me was enjoying this weirdness. It had to stop. I had to delete the video of me in Evie's office. Once she had nothing to blackmail me with, I'd get evidence that I could threaten her with and then I'd flip those tables around.

I waited a couple of days while I built up the nerve to act. Then, on Thursday night after dinner, I returned to the office. The cleaning crew would arrive in the early hours of the morning which meant it would be deserted until then.

I used my fob to enter the building and went straight up to my floor. As I made my way toward Evie's office I heard sounds coming from within. I stopped in my tracks and cocked my head to one side. I could hear the low, rhythmic grunts interspersed with sighs of pleasure and slaps of skin from behind the closed door.

No fucking way, I thought.

Being careful not to make any sound, I crept across the room until I arrived at Evie's office. The door had been left open a crack -- just enough for me to peek inside.

Evie was lying naked on her desk looking up at the ceiling. My breath caught in my throat as I saw her huge tits for the first time. I never thought I'd get to see them and yet there they were in all their perfect glory. They were even bigger out of her clothes than they looked in them. Her pink nipples were hard and stood in perfect peaks on top of her firm globes. Her boobs jiggled as Brad stood at the edge of the desk ramming his cock in and out of her rapidly. I wished so badly that I could at least have a feel of her tits, maybe even put one of them in my mouth.

I felt my cock stiffen so I reached down and pulled it out. The tip was already coated in sticky pre-cum and I grabbed the shaft and began to stroke myself, enthralled by the scene before me. I was seeing that sexy young girl in all her naked glory and it was even better than I'd ever imagined it would be. And what made it truly delicious was that she had no idea. She didn't know that I was seeing her naked and filled with pleasure. From now on every time she tormented me, I would know exactly what she looked like beneath her clothes and she would have no clue what I was thinking. It was a victory she would never be able to take from me. If wearing panties was the price then I would happily pay it.

As Brad pounded away at her he reached down and grabbed Evie's breasts, one in each hand. "These fucking tits are spectacular," he said.

"Unghh," was all she could manage in response. The pleasure he was giving her had robbed her of the ability to speak, the horny slut. She turned her head and then her lidded eyes shot open wide as she clocked me kneeling by the door with my dick in my hand.

"Jack!" she shrieked. She pulled away from Brad as she sat up. His cock fell out of her and hit her desk with a solid thwack. It was easily more than twice the size of my own.

"Fuck," I said. I went to tuck my own little dick away but Brad stopped me.

"Don't you fucking move, you creep," he shouted. He didn't seem at all ashamed to be standing naked in front of me. And why would he? He had the body of a Greek god.

"What are you doing here?" Evie demanded. She crossed her legs and pulled her arms over her chest, covering her amazing boobs from sight.

"I..." Before I could even think of an answer, Brad strode over to me, his dick bobbing up and down like a diving board. He grabbed me by my collar and dragged me into the room. I didn't get the chance to stand up and my knees scraped across the floor, my pants getting pulled right off me.

"Hey!" I protested, desperately trying to hang on to my clothes.

"You're not wearing your panties," Evie said. I had put on a pair of boxers as soon as I'd gotten home, as I did every evening.

"I wasn't at work," I said timidly.

"You follow my orders always. No matter where you are," Evie said. "Take the boxers off."

"But I--"

"Do as she says or I'll strip you," Brad warns, his eyes glinting evilly.

I surge of arousal burst through me and I had no idea why. I pulled off my boxers and pants quickly and let them fall into a messy pile on the floor. My dick was still hard and when Brad got a good look at it he snorted with laughter.

"Look at his little dicklet. I've seen bigger cocks on babies," he mocked. "Were you wanking to us fucking?"

My cheeks turned red as I looked down in shame. My dick had finally started to soften and shrink, although its smaller sizer was only going to give them more to laugh at.

"I was hoping you'd do something stupid soon so I'd have the chance to give you the other gift I bought you. I think you've earned it now," Evie said. She lowered her arms, no longer feeling the need to hide her gorgeous body from me, and hopped down off her desk. Her hips swayed and her breasts wobbled as she walked around the back of her desk and pulled open her drawer.

---

I watched on with misery, dreading what was about to come out of the desk drawer.

"Or maybe you'd prefer to get something of your own back. I could return your belt to you." She reached out and ran her fingers down the leather belt that still hung from her coat rack.

I almost accepted the offer. Almost. Then my brain kicked in and I realized the manner in which it would be returned to me. They'd hold me down and lash my ass with it until I couldn't sit down for a month. No, I'd much rather take my chances with whatever was in the drawer.

"I'll take the new thing please," I mumbled, my voice cracking in a squeak that made Brad laugh.

"Excellent," she purred, as she pulled out a small metal object that glinted in the light. It looked like a little... My heart dropped when she held it up and saw exactly what it was.

A chastity cage.

"No," I said and lunged for the door.

Brad grabbed my arm and yanked me back. "Hold still, you little bitch boy," he said. "You've earned this." He spun me back to face Evie and held both my arms behind my back.

I wiggled and squirmed but it was pointless. Despite my more advanced age, the younger man was far stronger than me. I could feel his hard cock poking my back; it was still wet and sticky with his and Evie's juices.

"Please," I begged as Evie kneeled down in front of me. If only she'd been kneeling to do something else.

"Shut up little boy," Brad growled in my ear.

"Brad don't call him that," said Evie. "I told you earlier when I explained what I've been doing to Jack, he's not a boy he's a baby girl."

Brad laughed and something inside me shriveled up and died. Not my cock though, that was starting to grow again.

"The bigger that is the more uncomfortable this is going to be," Evie warned me.

"I doubt it will be that uncomfortable for him," Brad scoffed, mocking my size again.

Evie took a large metal ring and taking hold of my cock and balls pulled them through it. She was surprisingly gentle, her soft fingers handling my junk delicately. The ring was wide enough that my cock had plenty of space to get through, but it was a bit more of a struggle to force my scrotum through. Evie managed with little issue.

The ring didn't hurt like I thought it would. In fact, it was surprisingly comfortable. Then she grabbed the cage, a small tube of criss-scrossed metal with a slit at the end that I guessed was for me to piss through. Which meant...she wasn't going to take it off.

She slipped the cage over my cock, even though it was a little erect she still had no trouble getting it on me. The cage attached to the ring and she used a tiny padlock to lock them together. And that was that. With one small click, the job was done. My boss, who was 16 years younger than me, had locked me in chastity.

She stood up and backed away from me, smiling broadly in a way that could match the devil. Then she opened her drawer and dropped the key to my chastity inside it. Brad shoved me down on the sofa and walked over to join her.

I sat on the sofa, staring up at my tormentors. My little caged cock twitched. I was more humiliated than I had ever been in my life and for some reason I was suddenly hornier than the average teenager. And yet there was nothing I could do about it because my cock was off-limits.

Brad pulled Evie toward him and their lips locked in a kiss. The sight of Brad and Evie kissing was too much for me. I looked away, my head pounding with shame and humiliation. As they kissed, Brad pulled Evie closer to him, his hands roaming over her body possessively.

My heart sank further as I looked back at them, their bodies pressed against each other as if they were dying for one another's touch. Evie's little fingers wrapped around Brad's big dick and began to stroke him. It felt like a cruel reminder that this was something I would never experience -- not so long as my cock stayed caged up and locked away. That didn't stop it from trying to grow. As my dick expanded it pushed painfully against the metal of the cage.

Brad took one of Evie's breasts in the palm of his hands and squeezed it hard enough to leave fingerprints on her lily-white flesh. Eventually, the kiss ended and the two of them looked at me with smug smirks on their faces.

"Oh, look at him," Brad said, pointing at me in disgust. A small string of pre-cum was dribbling from the tip of my cage.

"Get dressed and go home, Jack," Evie said. "If you behave yourself I might unlock your cage for an hour. But don't you ever wear men's underwear again. You only wear panties."

"Yes, ma'am," I said, my voice feeble.

I stood up and pulled on my clothes feeling more hopeless than ever. I'd come here to take away her leverage but I'd inadvertently given her more.

"Goodnight, Jackie," Brad called after me as I left the office.

I didn't reply. I wanted so badly to tug my cock, I was so fucking horny. And yet I could not. No, the only way I was going to get a shot at pleasure was if I obeyed Evie's every command and became her perfect little servant. Now I truly had no choice. She was my boss in every way. And some deranged part of me loved it.
