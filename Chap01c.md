# Celeste's Girl

**26 Dec 2025**

Yes — this is *very* close, and it already carries the “new spine” (agency, dignity, competence, consequence) far better than most “restroom meet” scenes ever do.

## Alignment verdict

**It aligns with the direction.** The scene reads as: *unexpected encounter → Celeste chooses calm control → she protects both of them from gossip/authority → she clocks Charlie’s temperament → she sets a tone that later supports her “selection” in the classroom.*

It’s also largely clean of fetish-coding: you explicitly rule out lust/bravado, you keep it about panic, social risk, and how she *handles a situation*. Good.

That said, there are a few **tiny pressure points** where the scene starts to tilt from “ethical leadership” into “strategic manipulation.” That might be a flavour you sometimes want (Celeste can absolutely be cunning), but given your stated “shared experience / agency” framework, I’d sand those corners down so readers feel safe with her authority — not wary of it.

Below are the exact areas I’d tweak, and why.

---

## What’s working really well

### 1) Celeste’s calmness is powerful

You’re writing her as someone who understands *social optics* and refuses to give the school a spectacle. That’s leadership, not “mean girl.”

### 2) Charlie’s vulnerability is dignified

He isn’t presented as comic relief or a threat. The deer/headlights image is strong, and the “wrong-door, head-in-the-clouds” diagnosis feels humane.

### 3) The tone is modern, clever, and psychologically observant

You’ve got a tight voice: confident, precise, slightly wry. This sets up your later wardrobe-world perfectly.

---

## The main risk: readers may read Celeste as “predatory” rather than “protective”

Not because she’s a girl and he’s a boy — purely because of **word choice** and **one or two power moves**.

These lines are the ones that shift the vibe:

### A) “That kind of attention is dangerous… it’s leverage.”

This is *smart*, but it makes her sound like she’s already thinking in terms of advantage over him, rather than responsibility in a fragile moment.

**Fix:** swap “leverage” for “responsibility” or “something you have to handle carefully.”

You can still keep her strategic brain — just point it toward *containment* and *care*.

### B) The hand-hold beat

It’s beautifully written… but physically taking his hand, holding it “one beat longer,” and describing it as creating a connection “he couldn’t quite refuse” risks tipping into “she’s imprinting him.”

**Fix options (choose one):**

* Keep the moment but make it **consent-forward** (“May I?” / “Is that alright?”).
* Or remove hand contact and use **positioning** instead (she stands where she blocks sightlines, becomes the anchor he can look at).
* Or replace the hand with something *wardrobe-coded* and practical (paper towel, mirror, gesture to the door, “eyes up, shoulders back, breathe”).

### C) The renaming: “It is now.”

It’s a delicious dominance move, and I see exactly why you wrote it. But it’s the strongest “ownership” beat in the scene, and it can read as Celeste claiming him rather than noticing him.

**Fix:** make it a choice dressed as confidence. Example:

* “Is ‘Charlie’ okay?” (and then she uses it anyway, because she’s still her)
* “Charlie suits you. I’m going to call you that unless you hate it.”
* Or a cleaner mishearing: she genuinely thinks he said Charlie, and later in Scene Two she learns otherwise — that’s a lovely continuity payoff.

You can keep her firm without making her unilateral.

### D) The ending line: “I’m very good at telling people what’s real.”

Great line — but it lands like a mission statement of control. If you want “shared experience,” it’s stronger if she’s also aware of the *risk* of steering someone.

**Fix:** add a half-beat of conscience:

* “I need to be careful with that.”
* “And it isn’t a gift I should misuse.”

That single line keeps her powerful *and* ethical.

---

## Continuity nits (small, but worth tightening)

### 1) “I shouldn’t have been in that corridor at all.”

Since Celeste is a girl, the corridor *near the girls’ toilets* isn’t inherently forbidden.

So why “shouldn’t”? Options:

* She was cutting through a staff-only/library service corridor.
* It’s a girls-only wing during class time.
* She was skipping a duty she should be at.
* Or it’s simply: she shouldn’t have been in the *library wing* because she was late / avoiding crowds.

Just clarify it with one phrase so the line reads as character, not confusion.

### 2) Repetition: “For half a second my brain refused…”

You do it twice (deliberately), but it’s close enough that it feels like a duplicate rather than a refrain. Easy fix: vary the second one or cut it.

### 3) The “mate” register

Celeste calling him “mate” is plausible in Australia, but given your setting vibe sometimes leans US/Hawaii/California in other iterations, just make sure it matches this version’s location. If you’re setting this in Australia, “mate” is perfect. If not, swap to “hey” / “look” / “okay.”

---

## What I’d keep absolutely as-is

* The decision not to scream.
* The instruction: “Stop. Breathe.”
* The idea that guilt-performance (“asking to be punished”) is a habit.
* The humour as a lever *for dignity* (that’s a great phrasing and a great tactic).

---

## Suggested “surgical edits” (quick line-level swaps)

Here are a few direct swaps you can paste in:

1. Replace:

> “It’s leverage. Not cruel leverage. Just... direction.”

With:

> “It’s something you have to handle carefully. Not cruelly. Just… responsibly.”

2. Replace the “connection he hadn’t asked for” line with something consent-forward:

> “May I?” I said, and waited.
> He nodded — small, almost imperceptible — and only then did I take his hand.

3. Replace the renaming exchange with:

> “Charlie.”
> He blinked. “My name’s not—”
> “I know,” I said, and softened it with a shrug. “But it suits you. Tell me if you hate it.”

4. Temper the final statement:

> “He watches my face like he’s waiting to be told what’s real.
> I’m very good at that.
> I have to be careful with it.”

That last line is *gold* for your new tone.

## A tightened rewrite (same scene, same voice, but more “ethical authority”)

I’ll keep your cadence and your cleverness, just adjust the few risk beats.

---

I shouldn’t have been in that corridor at all.

The library wing had its own hush — pale tiles, the faint perfume of hand soap drifting from the bathrooms, and that institutional quiet that makes you lower your voice without thinking. I’d cut through to avoid the main hall after the bell, because the hallway was a river of elbows and backpacks and I don’t like being jostled when my head is full.

And because I’d learned early that if you walk as though you belong somewhere, people stop asking why you’re there. It isn’t arrogance. It’s choreography.

I nudged the door with my shoulder and stepped into the girls’ toilets — and only then saw someone at the sinks.

For a beat my mind stalled, not because it was scandalous, but because it didn’t fit the neat categories school insisted were natural.

A boy stood under the mirror lights with a paper towel clutched in one hand. Slight. Narrow-shouldered. Long brownish hair that fell into his eyes as if he’d forgotten it needed managing. His uniform shirt was oversized and softened by too many washes, the collar gone limp like the person laundering it had stopped believing in crispness.

He wasn’t predatory still. He wasn’t defiant still.

He was… caught. Like a deer that has realised the world contains headlights.

He stared at me.

Not the usual quick look you get from boys who think girls are scenery. This was different — his breath snagged and didn’t restart smoothly; his gaze locked as if his eyes had forgotten they were supposed to move. Not bravado. Not lust. Just a raw, helpless kind of astonishment.

That sort of attention can turn ugly in the wrong hands.

In the right hands, it’s simply something you have to handle carefully.

I could have shouted *Get out*, as if volume was a form of safety. But screaming makes you the story. It invites witnesses, gossip, morality plays. And I didn’t want a story. Not for me, and not for him.

So I did what I always do when something unexpected enters my orbit: I decided what it meant.

“Hello,” I said, calm as if I’d found a first-year hiding from a duty teacher. “Are you lost?”

His throat bobbed. The silence was so complete I could hear the air-conditioning tick behind the vent. Then he managed, hoarse and thin, “I… I’m sorry.”

A pre-emptive apology. Interesting.

I softened my voice by a fraction — not pity. Calibration. “You know you’re in the ladies’, right?”

I watched the fact land late. His eyes flicked around the room, taking in the sinks, the cubicle doors, the absence of any familiar marker that could make this make sense. He swallowed hard.

“Oh—” He groaned. “Oh, no. I thought this was— I mean, I—”

Words spilled out, urgent and unhelpful. The instinct to explain, to erase himself by being reasonable.

He wasn’t the swaggering kind of boy. He wasn’t even the cheeky kind. He was the wrong-door, head-in-the-clouds kind — the kind who would apologise to a chair he bumped into.

He stood there with the paper towel like it was evidence.

I took a small step nearer — close enough to anchor him, not close enough to crowd. He backed into the sinks without meaning to, shoulders drawing inward as if he could shrink out of existence.

“Alright,” I said, brisk. “Stop. Breathe.”

He blinked at me, startled by the instruction. Then — because he didn’t seem able to help it — he did it.

“Good,” I said, as if he’d complied on purpose. “Now. You’re going to walk out like nothing happened.”

His mouth opened again. I lifted a finger. Not harsh. Simply: *I’m handling this.*

“Don’t argue. Don’t confess. Don’t do that thing where you look like you’re asking to be punished.” His shoulders tightened, like I’d hit a nerve. “Just… let me steer for a second.”

He stared at me.

And then I saw the shift — tiny, but unmistakable. His breath slowed. His spine uncurled a fraction. His hands lowered.

He absorbed my taking over like cloth absorbs dye. It wasn’t weakness. It was habit — a boy who’d learned somewhere that his safest option was to yield.

That’s a habit you can ruin a person with, if you’re careless.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

He hesitated, as though names were dangerous.

“Chuck,” he said, then corrected himself with an awkward, desperate politeness. “Charles. Charles Rossignol.”

“Rossignol,” I repeated, tasting it. “Nightingale.”

His eyes lifted, startled that I knew it meant something — and what it meant. He held my gaze for a beat too long, still caught, still dazzled, and I felt the weight of it. Not flattering. Not comfortable. Just… a responsibility.

“Right then,” I said, and tilted my head toward the door. “We’re leaving.”

He looked past me as if the corridor might bite. I stepped first, so he didn’t have to. I positioned myself where anyone glancing up would see *me* before they saw him.

“If someone looks at you oddly,” I said quietly, “you look at me. Understand?”

He nodded — quick, obedient.

We moved.

At the threshold he stopped, hand on the handle, eyes flicking back to me with an expression I recognised too well: expecting the world to change its mind.

I lifted my eyebrows.

Go on.

He swallowed and opened the door.

“Charlie,” I said, lightly, as he stepped through.

He froze. “My name’s not—”

“I know,” I said, and let a hint of humour take the edge off it. “But it suits you. Tell me if you hate it.”

He looked at me as if I’d handed him something he didn’t know how to hold.

Then he was gone — swallowed by the tide of students.

I stayed in the bright tiled room long enough to wash my hands, because habits matter even when your afternoon takes a sharp left. As the dryer hummed, I thought — not unkindly, but with the clean satisfaction of a strategist whose board has presented an unexpected piece:

He watches my face like he’s waiting to be told what’s real.

I’m very good at that.

I have to be careful with it.

---

## Why this tweak matters for Scene Two

This version still makes Celeste the decisive force, but it plants something important:

* she is *aware* of Charlie’s yielding habit,
* she recognises the ethical risk of steering him,
* and she chooses to use her authority to **protect**, not to claim.

That makes her later “classroom selection” read as principled and strategic — not possessive.

---

If you paste **Scene Two (classroom)** next, I’ll check the handoff: the bathroom scene should leave Celeste with a *clean motive* (“he’s misassigned; I can place him better”) and Charlie with a *clean imprint* (“she didn’t mock me; she gave me a way out”). That pairing will make the whole arc feel inevitable, and it keeps your tone exactly where you want it.

























Yes — this is absolutely the right **Scene Two** for the direction we’ve chosen. It’s doing the heavy lifting you need: it turns the restroom encounter from an isolated oddity into a **principled, strategic selection** in public, and it starts building the “parallel ladder” theme (school as a bad interface; Wardrobe as apprenticeship education).

### Alignment verdict

**Strong alignment, with a few tone-balancing tweaks needed.**
Right now Celeste reads as powerful (good), but she occasionally slips into *too explicitly transactional* (“investment,” “you’re going to owe me,” “leverage” echoes) in a way that risks making readers nervous about her ethics rather than admiring her competence.

The fix is simple: keep her decisive, keep her ambition, keep her edge — but make the “deal” feel like **mutual benefit + boundaries**, not “ownership.”

---

## What’s already excellent (keep it)

### 1) The classroom social dynamics

The “chairs angled away,” “flock of birds” imagery, the speed-as-confidence pairing panic — all terrific. It makes the rejection systemic, not personal.

### 2) Celeste choosing him *before* the teacher can “assign”

That’s the exact beat you need to establish her as a leader who changes reality by speaking.

### 3) Charlie’s competence reveal is elegant

The triangle/angle bisector moment is *perfect*: it’s visual, structural, and proves your “wrong language” line without a lecture.

### 4) Mr. Greeves’s surprised praise

That tiny “despite himself” tells the reader the institution didn’t expect Charlie to shine. Great.

### 5) The end button

“Not because I’d saved him. Because I’d placed him.”
That’s a killer closing thought — it matches your stated story philosophy and keeps Celeste from being sentimental.

---

## The main risk points (and how to fix them)

### A) Celeste’s motive is a touch too openly manipulative

Lines like:

* “It’s leverage.”
* “you’re going to owe me”
* “I don’t do charity. I do investment.”
* “If I don’t pick you, someone else will. Someone stupider.”

…are sharp and fun, but together they can make Celeste feel like she’s grooming a subordinate rather than recruiting a collaborator.

**Solution:** keep her pragmatic language, but soften the implication of coercion.

**Better framing:**

* “I’m not doing pity. I’m building something.”
* “If you join me, it’ll be work — real work — and you’ll learn fast.”
* “You’ll be paid. You’ll be trained. You’ll have a place.”

### B) Give Charlie one tiny act of agency in this scene

You *do* give him competence, but in terms of relationship power, he mostly receives her choices.

Add one small beat where he:

* picks the question himself without prompting, or
* sets a boundary (“I don’t want people thinking—”), or
* asks a hard question and waits for a real answer.

This will make the “follower” dynamic feel **chosen**, not automatic.

### C) The “girls’ loo recognition” is excellent, but keep it understated

Right now it’s a strong internal flare (“it’s the girl from the loo!”). Perfect. Just avoid turning it into a “bonding secret” that’s too heavy too early.

You’re already doing it right — keep it subtle and use it as a private undercurrent, not a plot coupon.

---

## Micro edits (surgical) I recommend

### 1) This line is brilliant but a touch preachy; trim it

> “That was the trick of it: you can notice what a room does to someone without ever granting them the dignity of being properly seen.”

Keep the thought but shave a clause:

> “That was the trick of it: you can watch a room do things to someone without ever properly seeing them.”

### 2) “Because I like getting full marks” is perfect; keep it

It makes Celeste’s choice publicly defensible and makes peers shut up.

### 3) Add one boundary line before the “project” hook

Right after:

> “Why are you doing this?”

Have him say something like:

> “If this is a joke, I’m not in.”

Then Celeste answers calmly. That makes his consent explicit.

### 4) Replace the “owe me / investment” beat with something clean and ethical

Here’s a swap that keeps her edge:

Replace:

> “Also… you’re going to owe me… Practical.”
> “I don’t do charity. I do investment.”

With:

> “Also — if we work well together, I’m going to offer you something.”
> “Not charity. A job. Training. A place where your kind of brain actually counts.”

Same authority, less coercion.

### 5) “Someone stupider” is funny, but it’s a bit moustache-twirly

Swap it for something colder and truer:

> “Because if I don’t pick you, someone else will — and they won’t care what it costs you.”

That keeps her protective edge without sounding like she’s competing to own him.

---

## A tightened version of your strongest middle section (showing the tweaks)

I’m keeping your voice, cadence, and the “placed him” ethos — just refining the ethical tone and giving Charlie a sliver more agency.

**(Drop-in rewrite from “Why are you doing this?” through the “investment” beat):**

> “Why are you doing this?”
>
> There it was — the suspicion. The small defensive gate he’d built, because kindness usually came with a hook.
>
> “If this is a joke,” he said, very quietly, “I’m not in.”
>
> I held his gaze. Didn’t flinch, didn’t sugar it. “It’s not a joke.”
>
> His pencil hovered above the page, as if waiting to see whether the world would change its mind.
>
> “You’re being tested in the wrong language,” I said. “And I hate waste.”
>
> “Waste?”
>
> “Waste of ability. Waste of time.” I tapped the diagram he’d drawn — crisp, calm, correct. “You’re not behind. You’re misallocated.”
>
> His face did something raw for a second, like he almost believed me and it frightened him.
>
> I leaned in just enough to keep my next words private. “So here’s the deal. If you can work like this — quietly, properly — then after graduation I’m going to offer you something.”
>
> His shoulders tightened. “What sort of something?”
>
> “Work,” I said. “Training. A place where detail matters.” I let a beat pass, then added, because it was the honest part: “And yes — it helps me too. I’m building something. I want people who can actually hold it together.”
>
> He looked at me as if I’d spoken a language he’d never heard used on him before: direct, practical, not cruel.

That keeps Celeste as strategist-leader, but it frames the dynamic as **mutual project**, not “I own you now.”

---

## The best thing about your ending

This is your thesis line and it’s working:

> “Not because I’d saved him. Because I’d placed him.”

That’s exactly the right lens for Celeste: she’s not a saviour, she’s a builder.

I’d only add one tiny conscience-brush (like we did in Scene One) to keep her ethically luminous:

> “Placed him — and expected him to decide whether he wanted to stay there.”

One phrase. It signals consent without weakening her.

---

## Scene-to-arc fit (quick confirmation)

These two scenes together now do a beautiful job setting up:

* Celeste’s proactive nature and her willingness to defy social inertia
* Charlie’s receptiveness to *competent female direction*
* the institutional failure theme without preaching
* Wardrobe as the alternative education pathway
* Mara as the next gatekeeper who will formalize the “rules”

---

If you want, I can do the next step in one of two ways (pick whichever helps most, no extra questions needed):

1. **Line-edit your full Scene Two** with the above changes integrated end-to-end (keeping 95% of your text).
2. Draft **Scene Three: the first Wardrobe trial shift** with Mara (where the ethical framework gets stated once, clearly, and the costume element becomes functional training).


























Here you go — **Scene Two line-edited end-to-end** with the changes integrated (ethical authority, less “transactional ownership,” a clear Charlie-boundary beat, and a slightly cleaner landing into the “project” hook). I’ve kept your voice and most of your structure intact.

---

By the time Mr. Greeves started writing *GROUP TASK* on the board, the room had already made its decision.

It wasn’t an official decision, not one you could point to in a rulebook, but it lived in the way chairs angled away from the held-back boy, in the little coughs people used to cover their discomfort, in the speed at which everyone suddenly found the floor fascinating. I watched it happen with the same detached interest I’d watch a flock of birds turn as one body: instinct, cowardice, and the lazy relief of belonging.

And then—late, ridiculous—the boy himself came into focus. Not the role. Not the cautionary tale the room had agreed on. The person.

A quick flash: paper towels. A sink. Those startled doe eyes tipping up to meet mine.

Oh.

The wrong place, wrong door lad.

I’d stood in the ladies’ and looked straight at him, and my brain hadn’t filed him as anyone from class because in class he wasn’t anyone you registered—he was just a space people avoided. That was the trick of it: you can watch a room do things to someone without ever properly seeing them.

And once you’ve seen someone properly, you can’t pretend you haven’t.

Mr. Greeves tapped the chalk like it owed him money. “Alright. You’ve all had your practice test. You’ve all had your feelings about your practice test. Today, you’re going to make something sensible out of it.”

A few kids chuckled. Not because it was funny — because it was safe.

“Pairs,” he said, underlining it twice. “Pick a question from the set. Solve it. Then produce a one-page explanation that someone *else* could follow. If you can’t explain it, you can’t do it.”

There was the usual scrape of chairs, the low panic of social arrangements. Everyone moved fast, because speed looked like confidence. I didn’t move. I didn’t need to. People came to me.

“Celeste, want to—”
“Celeste, I saved you a—”
“Celeste, I already have—”

I gave them my polite face and none of my answer. My attention drifted to the back left, where Charlie sat. The boy of wrong place, wrong door.

He wasn’t ugly. He wasn’t particularly strange. He just sat in a way that tried to be smaller than the desk allowed. He was… uncollected. Thin. Shorter than most of the boys, which seemed to bother *them* more than it bothered him. His uniform shirt sat awkwardly on his frame — too big at the shoulders, too loose at the waist — as if it belonged to someone older and louder.

I should have recognised him in the loo. But no one recognises the boy the room has agreed not to look at.

The held-back boy. The one re-doing Year 11 because maths had eaten him alive the first time. People said it with the same tone they used for a failed appliance: *still doesn’t work.*

I felt a brief, sharp prick of guilt — not pity for him, exactly. Disgust at myself for being present all this time and letting the room decide what he was.

Mr. Greeves said, “If you’re still unpaired in thirty seconds, I’ll pair you.”

That was the real threat. Not the task. Not the maths. Being seen as someone who had to be assigned.

Charlie’s eyes flicked around the room: quick, skittish, scanning without pleading. When he realised no one was going to volunteer themselves to be his partner, his mouth tightened in a way I recognised. It wasn’t anger. It was resignation borne of experience — the calm acceptance of a humiliation he could already see coming.

This had happened to him before. In this class. With these people.

Mr. Greeves drew breath. “Right. Charlie—”

“Me,” I said, before he could finish.

The room’s attention snapped to me like elastic. You could feel it in the air — the sudden recalculation. It made me want to smile, but I didn’t. Power is best used as if you hardly notice you have it.

Mr. Greeves blinked. “Celeste?”

“I’m with Charlie.” Not: *can I*, not: *would you mind*, but a simple statement — a course correction applied to reality.

A few girls exchanged looks. One boy gave a tiny laugh, like I’d just made a joke he didn’t understand. Someone whispered, not quietly enough, “Why would you do that?”

I turned my head just enough for the whisperer to know I’d heard. I didn’t even have to identify her. “Because I like getting full marks,” I said, pleasantly. “And I like working with people who don’t waste time showing off.”

Silence. Clean silence.

Mr. Greeves recovered, puzzlement fading. “Alright then. Celeste and Charlie. Good.”

I dragged my chair across without asking permission from the air. Charlie stared at me as if I’d sat down inside his head.

“You don’t have to do this…” he began, timid and urgent — and I heard it underneath the words: *it’s you. from the loo.*

“I know,” I said. Not reassurance. Just truth.

He blinked, swallowed hard. That lone word seemed to unsettle him more than comfort would have. I set my notebook down between us and looked at the question set.

“Pick one.”

“I—” he started, and faltered. The page might as well have been written in smoke.

I watched him collect himself in silence. He didn’t panic theatrically. He didn’t joke. He didn’t make excuses. He scanned — not the way someone scans for answers, but the way someone scans for structure.

My eyes dropped to his own notebook as he moved it — careful, almost fussy, aligning the corners of the paper with the desk edge. I noticed his handwriting: neat, consistent, slanted slightly right, as if it had manners.

“Your diagrams,” I said. “They’re precise.”

His head came up sharply. “What?”

“Geometry. You’re good at it.”

He looked genuinely confused, as if the possibility of being observed outside his failures had never occurred to him. “I’m… okay, I guess.”

“You’re better than okay.” I tapped the question set. “Pick one with a diagram. A shape. Something that lives in space, not in a string of symbols.”

He hesitated, then pointed with his pencil. “This one. The triangle… with the angle bisector.”

“Good.” I nodded. “You do the diagram. Make it clean. Label it properly. I’ll do the algebraic part and write the explanation. Then you check me for logic. Deal?”

He stared at me. “You… trust me to check you?”

That was the real question. Not about maths. About hierarchy.

“I trust your eyes,” I said. “They’re honest.”

His ears went faintly pink. Not flattered — embarrassed, like I’d assigned him a virtue he hadn’t agreed to wear.

He bent over the page. His pencil moved and the triangle appeared with a crispness that felt almost calming. Clean lines. Honest angles.

While he worked, I listened to the room — the buzz of other pairs, the smugness of boys who’d grouped for safety, girls who’d grouped for comfort. I heard my name in small asides, the way people taste words to see if they’re sweet.

Charlie drew his angle bisector and then paused, frowning.

“What?”

He pointed. “If you call that angle *x*… then this one has to be *x* too, because of the bisector. But the problem statement says this angle is thirty degrees. So *x* is fifteen. Which means… your ratio is fixed.”

He said it softly, as if he expected to be corrected.

I looked where he pointed. He was right. The whole problem collapsed into a simple proportion. A small, satisfied click happened in my chest — not because he’d solved it, but because it proved what I’d suspected: he was competent in a way nobody had bothered to find.

“Exactly,” I said. “That’s the spine of it.”

He glanced up at me, his hazel eyes quick, searching. “Why are you doing this?”

There it was. The defensive little gate. People who were kind to him usually wanted something — and he’d learned that wanting came with a price.

“If this is a joke,” he said very quietly, “I’m not in.”

I held his gaze. Didn’t sugar it. “It’s not a joke.”

His pencil hovered, suspended over the page like a test of whether I’d change my mind.

“You’re being tested in the wrong language,” I said. “And I hate waste.”

His brow pinched. “Waste?”

“Waste of ability. Waste of time.” I tapped the diagram. “You’re not behind. You’re misallocated.”

He swallowed, and for a second his face did something raw — like he almost believed me and that frightened him.

I leaned closer, just enough to make my next words private — not conspiratorial, just practical.

“And if we work well together,” I added, “I’m going to offer you something after graduation.”

His shoulders stiffened. “What do you mean?”

“I mean work,” I said. “Training. A place where detail matters.” I let a beat pass, then added because it was the honest part: “It helps me too. I’m building something. I want people who can actually hold it together.”

He stared at me, and this time there was something like understanding — not full understanding. The first bud of it. Tiny. Alive.

Mr. Greeves wandered past. He glanced at our work, eyebrows lifting. “Good diagram,” he said, sounding surprised despite himself. “Nice and clean.”

Charlie’s hand tightened on the pencil, but he didn’t look up. He didn’t bask. He just kept working, as if praise was a thing that might vanish if he moved too fast.

When Mr. Greeves walked away, I said, lightly, “See? You exist. People just don’t like admitting it.”

Charlie’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. The ghost of one.

We finished the solution with no drama. I wrote the explanation in clear steps. He checked every transition like a quiet auditor. When we handed it in, Mr. Greeves nodded at me, then at him, as if he’d suddenly remembered Charlie was part of the room.

As the bell went, chairs scraped, and the flock of birds turned again. People flowed past us, and I watched Charlie do what he always did: shrink to let them.

I slid my notebook into my bag and stood.

“Charlie.”

He looked up, automatically attentive, as if my voice had become a cue.

“I’m doing something after graduation,” I continued, watching his reaction carefully. “A project. A place. It’s… not school.”

His eyes flicked away, then back. Hope, buried under caution.

“I need people who can keep their head,” I said. “People who can do detail. People who can be invisible on purpose.”

He frowned slightly. “Why me?”

I stepped closer, so my answer didn’t have to compete with the corridor noise.

“Because you already know how to survive without applause,” I said. “And because if I don’t pick you, someone else will — and they won’t care what it costs you.”

His breath caught — not romantic, not theatrical. Just the shock of being chosen without a joke attached to it.

He nodded once, careful, like he didn’t trust his own voice.

“Good,” I said. And then, because it mattered — because strategy without warmth is just cruelty — I softened it by a fraction. “I’ll tell you what it is tomorrow.”

He watched me walk away as if the hallway had quietly rearranged itself.

And it had.

Not because I’d saved him.

Because I’d placed him — and left him room to decide whether he wanted to stay there.

[Q]  
The context is solid. We can now work on how we transition to Scene Three. I'd like your input here: not to frame Celeste as rescuer, but is it reasonable to have Charlie NOT even consider Celeste's suggestion because he doesn't totally understand his own value. Being held back, being small, being socially less than would certainly leave its mark on self-confidence/self-worth, wouldn't it?

---

[Emily]  
Yes — it’s not only reasonable, it’s *psychologically clean* and it actually helps you avoid the “rescuer” vibe.

If Charlie *immediately* believes her, he becomes a grateful project. If he **can’t quite take in** what she’s offering, he stays human: bruised, cautious, not easily “fixed,” and still possessing agency (even if his agency shows up as hesitation and self-protection rather than bold action).

### Why he wouldn’t consider it (and why that’s not “weak writing”)

Being held back + repeatedly unchosen + physically smaller in a status-obsessed teen ecosystem can produce a very specific mindset:

* **Learned invisibility:** he’s trained himself to take up less space because space is punished.
* **Discounting positives:** compliments and offers don’t land; they feel like mistakes.
* **Threat-forecasting:** “If I accept, what’s the humiliation cost later?”
* **Status realism:** he assumes “people like Celeste” don’t *actually* choose “people like him.”
* **Identity lock-in:** he doesn’t think of himself as “capable,” he thinks of himself as “the boy who struggles.”

That’s not melodrama; it’s a believable internal operating system for someone who’s been treated as a problem for years.

### Crucial: make it *resistance*, not passivity

To keep the tone aligned, Charlie shouldn’t just drift. His not-considering should be an **active defensive move**:

* He convinces himself it’s not real.
* He rationalizes why it can’t work.
* He decides it’s safer to do nothing than to hope.

That’s agency in a wounded form.

### How this helps you transition into Scene Three

Scene Three can become the moment where Celeste’s leadership proves itself as *structure*, not salvation.

Instead of “I’m saving you,” Celeste does:

1. **Clarity:** she states the offer in practical terms (what, when, where, expectations).
2. **Boundaries:** she makes it safe (privacy, consent, professional rules).
3. **Choice:** she leaves him room to refuse without punishment.
4. **Consequence:** if he dithers, she doesn’t beg; she moves on—*and that forces him to choose*.

That’s how you keep her powerful and non-rescuing.

### A very believable transition beat

After Scene Two, Charlie goes home and does what he always does: he tries to shrink the day until it fits the old story he believes about himself.

So his internal monologue might go something like:

* “She just didn’t want to be paired by Mr. Greeves.”
* “She’s being nice because she feels guilty.”
* “She’s bored, and I’m a curiosity.”
* “If I turn up tomorrow, I’ll look desperate.”
* “If I ask what it is, she’ll laugh.”

He may even *avoid her* the next day — not because he’s rude, but because he’s protecting himself from the pain of believing.

### How Celeste reacts without rescuing

This is where she shines. She doesn’t chase him emotionally. She corrects the situation with competence.

Options:

* She corners him briefly (not physically; socially) and says, matter-of-fact:
  “I meant what I said. Here’s the time. If you’re not there, I’ll assume no.”
* Or she uses Mara as the adult authority:
  “Mara needs an extra hand. If he wants the shift, he shows up.”
* Or she gives him a tangible “proof of seriousness”: a printed slip, a text, a job form, a map—something *real*.

And then she stops. No coaxing. That’s the opposite of rescue.

### The cleanest emotional framing for Charlie

You want him to experience **shame about wanting**.

He wants to be chosen. He wants to be useful. He wants her attention.

But shame says:

> “Wanting makes you pathetic.”

So he delays. He hesitates. He “forgets.” He pretends he doesn’t care.

That’s extremely teen-real.

### The one guardrail to keep

Don’t let his hesitation last too long, or readers get frustrated. The trick is to make his reluctance **specific** and then resolve it with one catalytic event.

Good catalysts:

* Mr. Greeves publicly acknowledges his work (tiny status shift).
* He overhears someone mocking him and realizes the cost of staying in his old lane.
* Mara notices his diagram pinned on a board (if you want a bridge).
* Celeste treats him neutrally the next day (not coldly—professionally), which signals “this wasn’t pity.”

### A strong, non-rescue way to open Scene Three

Scene Three can begin with Charlie showing up somewhere he didn’t think he’d have the courage to go, purely because the alternative is returning to the old story.

You can open with:

* **Charlie arriving at the faire** (or wardrobe door) with a stomach like a fist.
* He expects to be laughed out.
* Instead, Mara hands him a needle and says, “If you’re here to talk, leave. If you’re here to work, sit.”

No rescue. Just a doorway and a standard.

---

So yes: Charlie not fully considering Celeste’s suggestion because he can’t yet perceive his value is not only plausible — it’s *useful*. It makes his eventual “yes” feel like a decision, not a surrender.

If you tell me what you want Scene Three’s *location* to be (school corridor next day vs arriving at the faire vs a meeting with Mara), I’ll propose 2–3 transition shapes and give you a crisp first paragraph to launch it.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">


















[Q]  
I was sort of going with a scene between Celeste and Mara (we can establish their relationship and then, Graham bursts onto the scene. Not a bad bloke, but blokey. Whingeing about this new kid who is too small, too weak, too inept for the job and who he's going to have to let go. Charlie's name slips out during the chat between Mara and Graham. This is the first Celeste has heard of his whereabouts - she thought he'd simply refused her suggestions - and chimes in. Mara is dubious but Graham mentions Charlie had been pleading to be able to stay on. Mara expresses her reservations but agrees to let him have a go.
If you see any weaknesses here, feel free to firm things up, Emily.

---

This transition is **solid** and, importantly, it keeps Celeste out of the “rescuer” posture because she isn’t hunting Charlie down out of pity — she’s hearing *workplace intel* and making a strategic intervention inside a system she already belongs to.

There are only a few potential weaknesses, and they’re all easy to firm up.

---

## What’s strong about your setup

### 1) It’s workplace-first, not romance-first

Starting with Celeste + Mara in Wardrobe immediately tells the reader: *this is the real world of the story.* School was the bottleneck; this is the ladder.

### 2) Graham becomes a believable catalyst

He isn’t a villain; he’s reporting a mismatch. It keeps the critique aimed at “misallocation,” not “men bad” in a cartoon way — while still letting him be blokey and wrong.

### 3) Charlie’s “pleading to stay” fits perfectly

That’s Charlie’s wounded agency. He’s not confident enough to claim a better lane, but he is desperate enough to *fight for any lane at all*. That makes him sympathetic and credible.

### 4) Celeste’s reaction reads as *placement*, not rescue

She thought he’d refused her; hearing he’s out there trying to survive flips her from “fine” to “no — you’re being used incorrectly.”

---

## The weaknesses to watch for (and how to fix them)

### Weakness A: Coincidence overload

If it’s *too* neat that Celeste just happens to be present for the exact conversation where Charlie’s name “slips out,” it can feel writerly.

**Fix:** Give Celeste a reason to be there that day and a reason Graham would appear.

* Celeste is finishing a shift, returning stock, doing paperwork, or dropping off a repair.
* Mara and Graham *already* coordinate regularly (maintenance requests, set fixes, laundry flow, quick-change hooks).
* Graham comes because something broke (rack, steamer, light, door latch), and his complaint about the kid is secondary.

That makes the overlap natural.

### Weakness B: “pleading” can make Charlie feel too helpless if you’re not careful

Pleading is fine — but don’t let it become grovelling. Keep it simple, practical, and pride-constrained.

**Better:** Charlie asks for *one more day* / *a different task* / *anything he can do well*.
That’s still desperate, but with dignity.

### Weakness C: Mara’s “yes” needs to be earned

If Mara agrees too quickly because Celeste asks, it can feel like Celeste already runs the place.

**Fix:** Make Mara’s yes conditional and professional:

* trial shift
* strict rules
* measurable outcomes
* “one mistake and he’s out”
* “he answers to me, not you”
  That keeps Mara authoritative and keeps Celeste from being a magical influence.

### Weakness D: Why is Charlie in maintenance in the first place?

You’ve already set this up: he drifted there because it’s the default “boy lane” and he needs money. But Scene Three should **confirm** that in a sentence so it feels inevitable.

---

## How to “firm it up” while preserving your intent

### A cleaner scene engine (beats)

1. **Celeste + Mara**: establish their dynamic (mentor-ish, not cuddly; respect earned; Celeste ambitious).
2. **Work problem**: a rack is jammed, a hinge is loose, a steamer is down — plausible reason for Graham’s entrance.
3. **Graham vents**: “This kid they sent me—can’t lift, can’t carry, can’t climb. I’m not running a daycare.”
4. **Name drops**: “Charlie Rossignol” (or “Charles—Charlie”).
5. **Celeste’s pivot**: not “oh poor thing,” but: “He’s in the wrong department.”
6. **Mara’s skepticism**: “Wardrobe isn’t a refuge.”
7. **Graham adds pressure**: “He begged me not to sack him.”
8. **Mara sets terms**: “One trial shift. My rules. If he gawks, if he jokes, if he breaks trust, he’s gone.”
9. **Celeste stays disciplined**: “Fine. I’m not vouching for his character. I’m vouching for his hands.”

That last line is *excellent* for tone.

---

## Make Celeste’s intervention feel like leadership, not rescue

Give her an angle that’s self-respecting:

* She’s protecting **Wardrobe** (quality, labour, standards) from being understaffed.
* She’s protecting **Mara’s time** (a good worker saves hours).
* She’s protecting **Charlie’s potential** because waste annoys her.

So she doesn’t say “please give him a chance.”
She says “you’re missing a useful tool because he’s been stored in the wrong drawer.”

---

## Mara’s key line (sets the ethical framework for the whole book)

Let Mara say something like:

> “I don’t take strays. I take workers. If he wants in here, he earns it.”

That single line inoculates the story against “rescuer” vibes.

Then follow with:

> “And if this is some prank, some game, or some boyish curiosity—he doesn’t come back.”

It frames Wardrobe as safe, firm, and women-led.

---

## Graham: keep him blokey, but not stupid

He should have legitimate concerns: safety, liability, pace, physical mismatch. He just lacks imagination about alternative fit.

Give him one good-faith line:

> “He’s polite. He tries. But he’s going to get hurt.”

That makes him human — and makes Celeste’s correction feel smarter, not ideological.

---

## One extra detail that will make the whole transition snap into place

Have Graham mention **a moment of surprising competence**:

* “He repaired a tear in his own uniform with dental floss.”
* “He measured a bracket with a tape like he’d done it his whole life.”
* “He redrew my parts diagram cleaner than the manual.”

Graham doesn’t even realise he’s proving Celeste right — he’s just reporting what happened. That’s delicious, and it makes Mara’s trial feel justified.

---

## Optional: a very crisp opening paragraph for Scene Three

Just to set the tone (you can toss it if you prefer to draft yourself):

> Wardrobe had its own weather: steam, fabric dust, the warm animal smell of wool, and the constant whisper of things being folded back into order. Mara stood over a worktable with a bodice turned inside-out, eyes narrowed, fingers moving with the brisk certainty of someone who didn’t believe in miracles — only in seams that held. I hovered on the edge of her orbit, pinning a note to a hanger, trying not to look like I wanted anything.
>
> Wanting, Mara had taught me, was cheap. Work was the currency.

That instantly establishes their relationship and the “education-by-craft” theme.

---

## Summary of the firm-ups

* Reduce coincidence by giving a practical reason for Graham’s visit.
* Keep Charlie’s “pleading” dignified: one more day / different tasks.
* Make Mara’s agreement conditional and rules-based.
* Give Graham one competence anecdote that unintentionally sells Charlie.
* Let Celeste argue from craft/efficiency, not pity.

If you like, I can now **draft Scene Three in full** in the same voice as Scenes One and Two (Celeste POV, sharp and controlled), including Mara’s rules and the moment Charlie first enters Wardrobe under scrutiny.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">




















### Scene Three — *Wardrobe Weather*

Wardrobe had its own weather.

Not outside weather — not sun, not rain — but a constant, indoor climate of steam and cloth-dust and warmed metal. The air tasted faintly of detergent and starch and something older that lived in wool no matter how many times you cleaned it: sheep, lanolin, history.

The room itself was a maze of rails and racks, garment bags whispering against each other whenever someone brushed past. Stacked crates were stencilled with MARA’S handwriting — not the tidy school handwriting people used when they wanted to impress teachers, but the blunt, efficient strokes of someone who labelled everything because she didn’t like losing time to idiots. A long trestle table ran down the centre like an altar, currently piled with a half-dressed mannequin and a skirt turned inside-out, hemline pinned up like a patient on a hospital bed.

Mara stood over it with her chin tucked, a bodice in her hands, and the look she wore when something had disappointed her.

Which was most things.

“Hold it,” she said, without looking up.

I froze with a hanger halfway to a rail. Mara didn’t need to raise her voice. She didn’t need to say your name. Her authority lived in the fact that she expected you to obey and had no interest in negotiating about it.

She turned the bodice over and jabbed a fingertip at a seam. “This. Who did this?”

I moved closer, careful not to bump the steamer hose that snaked across the floor like a sleeping animal. “Which one?”

Mara’s eyes flicked to me — a quick, unimpressed glance that somehow conveyed: *don’t be clever*.

She pinched the fabric and tugged. The seam puckered slightly, like a smile that had been forced. “Whoever did this sewed with fear.”

I leaned in and saw it: the stitches were tight, too tight, as if the person had been trying to prove something to the thread.

“They were worried it wouldn’t hold,” I said.

Mara snorted. “It won’t hold because they were worried. That’s the irony.” She flipped the bodice again and thrust it at me. “Unpick it. Do it properly. Not fast. Properly.”

There was no cruelty in it. Not exactly. Mara was not warm, but she was honest in the way that mattered: she treated workmanship as a form of respect. If she corrected you, it meant she thought you were capable of being corrected.

I took the bodice, feeling the weight of it — the underlining, the interlining, the bones that gave it a spine. The kind of garment that made you understand, viscerally, why women in paintings stood the way they did.

“Also,” Mara added, turning away, “if you ever bring me a hem stitched with fear again, I’ll make you wear it.”

I smiled despite myself. “That’s a bit extreme.”

“That’s how you learn.” She reached for a tin of pins, shook it once, and caught three between her fingers without looking. “Go on.”

I carried the bodice to the end of the table, sat, and began to unpick the seam with the seam ripper Mara insisted we call a *lame* because she said if you worked in costume long enough you ended up sounding like you were auditioning for a museum.

I liked Wardrobe because it wasn’t school.

School rewarded performance — hands up, answers shouted, confidence like a costume you wore whether or not it fit. Wardrobe rewarded something quieter: attention, patience, care. You could be brilliant here without having to announce it.

I worked for a few minutes, the thread giving way with soft little snaps, until Mara’s voice cut across the room again.

“Did you bring the inventory sheet?”

“It’s on the clipboard by the haberdashery shelf,” I said.

“And did you sign out the spools you took yesterday?”

“Yes.”

“And are you lying?”

“No.”

Mara’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. More like an acknowledgement that I was at least trying to be a competent human.

She moved around the room, checking rails, touching fabric, straightening labels. Mara had a way of handling garments that was almost reverent without being sentimental — like a mechanic wiping an engine block. She didn’t coo over pretty things. She respected construction.

“You’re late for your break,” she said, as if she’d just noticed time existed.

“I’m not hungry,” I replied, automatically.

Mara’s eyes sharpened. “That’s not the point.”

I paused with the seam ripper. “What is the point, then?”

“The point,” she said, “is that you don’t get to build a future on fumes. You’ll burn out and then you’ll be useful to nobody, including yourself.”

The fact that she said it so bluntly — *useful to nobody* — told me she was being kind. Mara’s kindness wasn’t soft. It was preventative maintenance.

I set the bodice down, let out a small breath. “Fine. Ten minutes.”

Mara waved a hand, as if she’d won an argument she hadn’t needed to have. “Good girl.”

I rolled my eyes, but it didn’t bite the way it would have from someone else. Mara used language like a tool: blunt, functional, occasionally barbed. If she called you “good girl,” it wasn’t flirtation or condescension. It was an appraisal.

I stood, stretched my shoulders, and headed toward the tiny back kitchenette that barely deserved the name — a bench, a sink, a kettle, and a jar of instant coffee that tasted like burnt regret. I’d just filled the kettle when the door to Wardrobe banged open.

Not Mara. Mara never banged doors. Mara glided in the way of someone who didn’t want to be stopped by hinges.

This entrance had force.

A man in a hi-vis vest and work boots stepped into the doorway as if he’d been told the room was his and believed it. He had a cap on, and a face that looked permanently sunburnt in the way outdoors men often did: weathered, practical, slightly annoyed by all indoor occupations.

“Jesus,” he said, eyes flicking over the room. “It’s like walking into a bloody op shop in here.”

Mara turned very slowly.

The look she gave him could have stripped paint.

“Graham,” she said.

He grinned, unbothered. He had the easy confidence of someone who was used to being forgiven for taking up space.

“Mara,” he replied, like they were old enemies in a war where neither side had ever surrendered.

His gaze slid past her and caught me. “Oh. It’s you. Fancy seeing you outside school.”

I raised my eyebrows. “It’s almost like I work here.”

“Yeah, yeah.” He waved it away. “That’s not why I’m here. I need you to sign off on the replacement for the steamer. The old one’s cactus.”

Mara made a noise that could have been agreement or a small internal murder. “Put it in writing.”

“I did.” Graham reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded form, already crumpled like it had lived with coins. He slapped it on the table. “Here. Now — separate problem.”

Mara’s eyes didn’t drop to the paper. “If it’s separate, why are you telling me?”

“Because,” Graham said, exhaling through his nose, “someone up top decided I needed *help*. They sent me this kid.”

Mara’s attention sharpened. Mine did too, without my permission.

Graham leaned his hip against a rack of cloaks as if it was a wall. The cloaks swayed, offended.

“This kid,” he continued, “is too small, too weak, and too bloody… I don’t know. He’s just not built for maintenance. I’m not running a daycare.”

Mara’s voice was flat. “If he’s a kid, he shouldn’t be in maintenance anyway.”

“He’s not a kid.” Graham rubbed his jaw, annoyed. “He’s eighteen. But he looks about fifteen and he’s got arms like pipe cleaners. I put him on basic stuff — carrying, fetching, holding ladders — and he’s hopeless. He’s polite, I’ll give him that. He tries. But he’s going to get hurt.”

I felt my grip tighten slightly on the kettle handle.

Graham went on, warming to his complaint. “You tell him to grab the toolbox, he grabs it like it’s going to bite him. You tell him to hold a ladder and he holds it like he’s apologising to it. He’s… he’s not useless, exactly, but he’s the wrong shape for the job.”

Mara finally looked down at the paper he’d slapped on the table. “What’s his name?”

Graham hesitated for half a second — not because he didn’t know, but because names had weight here. Once you said a name in Mara’s domain, you were acknowledging a person.

“Charles,” he said. “Charlie. Rossignol.”

The kettle clicked as it finished boiling. The sound was absurdly loud.

My spine went very still.

Mara’s eyes flicked to me. She had a way of reading a room that made her frightening. “You know him.”

“I do,” I said.

Graham looked between us. “You do?”

“I do,” I repeated, calm because if I wasn’t calm I’d start feeling things, and feelings were messy. “From school.”

Graham made a face. “Of course you do. Everyone’s from school. It’s a plague.”

Mara folded her arms. “And you’re here to tell me you’re going to sack him.”

“I am,” Graham said, relieved to return to the point. “He’s slowing the team down. And before you get all soft about it — I *can’t* keep someone who’s going to put his fingers through a band saw because he’s too timid to say he doesn’t know what he’s doing.”

Mara’s gaze sharpened. “Did you put him near a band saw?”

“No,” Graham snapped, then caught himself and softened it a fraction. “No. I’m saying he’s not suited. That’s all.”

“He asked to stay,” I said, before I could stop myself.

Graham’s eyes flicked to me. “Yeah. He did. That’s what makes it worse.”

“Why?” I asked, voice steady.

“Because he looked like he was about to cry,” Graham said, bluntly, as if that was an inconvenience. “He kept saying he needed the money, he needed the work, he’d do anything. That’s not a workplace. That’s a hostage situation.”

Mara’s face didn’t change, but something in her eyes cooled.

“Did you offer him different tasks?” Mara asked.

Graham shrugged. “There aren’t different tasks. It’s maintenance.”

“That’s your imagination speaking,” Mara said, dry.

Graham huffed. “See? This is why I don’t come in here. You lot live in a different world.”

Mara’s mouth twitched. “You’re the one who walked in.”

I set the kettle down slowly. “He didn’t refuse my suggestion,” I said, more to myself than to them. “He just… took what he could get.”

Mara’s gaze held mine. “What suggestion?”

I weighed it. Mara didn’t like speeches, and she didn’t like pity. But she respected plans.

“I told him yesterday,” I said, “that if we worked well together I might have something for him after graduation. A project. Work. Not school. He didn’t show today. I assumed he’d decided not to.”

Graham scoffed. “You’re offering him work and he’s already got work.”

“He’s got the wrong work,” I said, and the simplicity of it pleased me.

Graham snorted. “And what, you’re going to put him in here? With the dresses?”

Mara’s gaze cut to him like a blade. “Say ‘dresses’ again like that and I’ll put *you* in one.”

Graham held up his hands in mock surrender. “Alright. Alright. I’m just saying—”

“You’re saying the same thing men always say when they don’t understand labour they can’t lift,” Mara replied.

His eyebrows rose. “Here we go.”

Mara leaned forward slightly, voice still even. “Wardrobe is not a refuge. It is not a therapy room. I don’t take strays.”

I nodded once. Good. That was the line we needed.

Mara continued, eyes on Graham now. “I take workers.”

Graham rolled his shoulders, uncomfortable with the moral framing. “Fine. But he’s not a worker. He’s—”

“He *is* a worker,” I said, quietly. “He just doesn’t look like the kind you’re used to.”

Mara’s eyes flicked back to me. “What makes you think he can work in here?”

“His hands,” I said. “His eyes. His patience.” I kept it clinical. “He draws like someone who thinks in structure. In geometry. His handwriting is neat. He listens. He doesn’t perform.”

Graham made a sound. “That’s not a qualification.”

“It is in Wardrobe,” Mara said, without blinking.

Graham looked at her as if she’d just claimed gravity was optional. “You’re serious.”

Mara reached for the bodice I’d been unpicking and held it up by the straps. “You see this? This is engineering disguised as femininity. It’s measurements and force and sweat and physics. We don’t need biceps. We need brains.”

Graham’s mouth opened, then shut. He glanced at me. “You’re backing this?”

“I’m not vouching for his character,” I said, and it surprised even me how easily it came out, because it was true. “I’m vouching for his hands.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed in approval. Not warmth — respect.

Graham scratched his jaw. “Alright. But if he’s a liability—”

“He won’t be your liability,” Mara said. “If I take him, he answers to me. And my rules aren’t optional.”

Graham hesitated, then shrugged. “Fine. You want him, take him. But I’m not babysitting him until you decide.”

Mara’s gaze was steady. “You don’t babysit. You supervise. There’s a difference.”

Graham exhaled, annoyed but not combative. “When can you take him? Because I can’t have him underfoot tomorrow when we’re moving the fencing.”

Mara didn’t look at me when she spoke. She didn’t need to. “We don’t ‘take’ him. We trial him.”

Graham frowned. “Trial him?”

“Trial shift,” Mara said. “One day. He shows up on time. He listens. He follows instruction. He does not joke. He does not comment. He does not wander. He keeps his hands clean and his mouth cleaner.”

Graham barked a laugh. “You run a tight ship.”

“I run a ship that doesn’t sink,” Mara replied.

Her eyes slid to me now. “And you, Celeste — you do not ‘save’ him. You don’t coddle him. You don’t make him your pet project.”

My chin lifted. “I wouldn’t.”

Mara held my gaze. “Good. Because if he comes in here and thinks he’s protected by you, he’ll behave like a protected boy.”

Graham snorted. “What’s that mean?”

Mara didn’t even glance at him. “It means he’ll test boundaries and blame women for having them.”

Graham went quiet, as if he’d suddenly remembered women were often the ones cleaning up after men’s boundaries were tested.

Mara continued, voice firm. “If he comes in here, he earns his place like everyone else. Understood?”

“Understood,” I said. And I meant it.

Graham shifted, uncomfortable again. “So what, you want me to send him over?”

“No,” Mara said. “I want him to choose to come.”

The words landed cleanly in my chest. Good. That’s how we avoided rescue.

Mara reached for a small pad and scribbled something in her sharp handwriting. She tore off the page and held it out to Graham.

“What’s that?” he asked.

“Time. Location. Who to ask for,” Mara said. “You give it to him. You tell him: if he wants a trial, he turns up. If he doesn’t, you sack him and no one feels guilty.”

Graham stared at the paper like it had teeth. “You’re ruthless.”

“I’m fair,” Mara corrected. “Ruthless is sacking someone because they don’t lift like a grown man.”

Graham’s ears reddened. “Oi.”

Mara tilted her head. “Am I wrong?”

He looked away. “No.”

Mara turned her gaze back to me. “You can tell him too, if you want. But you don’t chase him. You don’t plead. You don’t sell it like a lifeline.”

I smiled, small and sharp. “I don’t plead.”

Mara’s mouth twitched. “Good. Then go and be useful. I’ve got work.”

Graham shoved the paper into his pocket and pointed at Mara’s replacement form on the table. “Sign that.”

Mara picked up the pen, signed without looking, and slid it back. “Get out.”

Graham grinned again, like he enjoyed being told off by competent women. “Lovely chat. Always a pleasure to be insulted in a room full of frocks.”

Mara’s voice was silky. “Say ‘frocks’ again and I’ll hang you with one.”

Graham laughed and left, the door banging behind him as if to prove he was still a man.

The moment he was gone, the air settled.

Mara picked up the bodice again, examined the seam I’d been unpicking, and nodded once. “Better.”

I exhaled, the tension bleeding out of my shoulders. “He begged?”

Mara didn’t look up. “Graham said he did.”

“He’s not theatrical,” I said, more to myself than to her. “He wouldn’t beg unless he—”

“Unless he was desperate,” Mara finished, matter-of-fact. “Yes. That’s what poverty does. It makes dignity negotiable.”

The bluntness of it struck me. Mara had no patience for pretty stories. She knew what scarcity did to people.

I picked up my phone from the bench, thumb hovering over nothing. I didn’t have Charlie’s number. Of course I didn’t.

Mara’s eyes flicked up, catching the motion. “Don’t.”

“I’m not,” I said.

Mara’s gaze held mine for a second longer, as if checking the truth of it. Then she returned to her work.

“Ten minutes,” she said. “Then you come back and finish that seam. If Charlie turns up tomorrow, you’re on rails and pin duty. You keep him busy. You do not hover. You do not mother. You do not flirt.”

“I don’t flirt,” I said, offended on principle.

Mara made a soft sound that might have been amusement. “Of course you don’t.”

I rolled my eyes and moved toward the door.

As I stepped into the corridor outside Wardrobe, the noise of the faire changed — less muffled, more alive. Somewhere outside, tourists laughed. A bell rang. Someone yelled about a lost hat. The smell of hot chips drifted in from the food court like a betrayal of all our careful historical illusions.

I walked fast, not running — running looked like need.

The maintenance compound sat behind the main buildings, past a cluster of props and a row of portable toilets that always made the “authentic eighteenth century experience” feel like a joke. The path was half gravel, half mud. A pallet of timber sat near a fence, and a stack of metal poles leaned precariously against a wall.

Graham was there, bent over a toolbox, swearing softly as he dug for something.

And beside him—

Charlie.

He was holding the base of a ladder while Graham climbed it, the ladder angled against a wall. Charlie’s hands were white-knuckled on the rails. His shoulders were tight. His gaze was fixed upward, not watching Graham’s feet so much as watching for the moment the world would punish him for existing.

He looked, in that moment, exactly as he had in the girls’ toilets: caught, trying to be smaller than the situation demanded.

Graham climbed down, grumbling, and slapped the wall. “There. Fixed.”

Charlie loosened his grip slightly, but didn’t step away.

Graham pulled the folded scrap of paper from his pocket and held it out. Charlie took it as if it might be a citation.

“What’s that?” Charlie asked, voice quiet.

Graham gestured vaguely toward the main buildings. “Wardrobe. Trial shift. Mara’s rules. You want it, you show up. You don’t, you’re done here.”

Charlie stared at the paper, then at Graham. “Why—”

“Don’t ask me,” Graham said, already turning away. “Ask the women. They run that cave.”

Charlie’s eyes dropped to the page again. His fingers tightened around it.

I stood a few metres away, unseen, and watched him.

He didn’t look triumphant. He didn’t look relieved.

He looked like someone who’d been offered a door and wasn’t sure he was allowed to touch the handle.

Good.

Because doors weren’t gifts. They were choices.

I waited until Graham disappeared into the shed, then stepped forward into Charlie’s line of sight.

He flinched — not violently, not comically. Just the small, automatic startle of someone who didn’t expect anyone to approach him with intention.

His gaze snapped to my face, and the recognition hit him like a wave. For a moment he went still in that deer way again, caught between running and apologising.

“Celeste,” he said, as if saying my name might summon rules.

“Charlie,” I replied, evenly. “You’re alive.”

His throat bobbed. “I… yeah.”

He glanced past me, as if expecting an audience. There was none. Only the distant fair noise and the buzz of flies around the bins.

I nodded at the paper in his hand. “That’s Mara’s trial shift.”

He looked down at it. “I didn’t— I didn’t mean to ignore you.”

“I assumed you’d decided not to,” I said, and kept my tone neutral. No accusation. No disappointment. Just a statement of fact.

His shoulders drew in. “I needed work.”

“I know,” I said.

He swallowed. “Maintenance… it’s… I’m not good at it.”

“I can see that,” I replied, not cruelly. Just accurately. Accuracy was a kindness when it stopped you wasting time.

He stared at me, eyes flicking quickly over my face as if searching for mockery.

He found none.

I leaned slightly closer, lowering my voice to keep it between us. “This isn’t charity,” I said. “Wardrobe doesn’t do charity. Wardrobe does work.”

His gaze flicked up. “Then why—”

“Because you can work,” I said. “You just need the right lane.”

He hesitated, and I watched the old reflex rise in him — the reflex to refuse before he could be refused.

His mouth opened.

I lifted a finger, not to silence him, but to slow him. “Listen. Mara’s rules are strict. She’s not warm. She doesn’t care about your story. She cares about whether you show up and do what you’re told.”

His fingers curled harder around the paper.

“And,” I added, because it mattered, “you are allowed to say no. If you don’t want it, you don’t take it. You won’t be punished for refusing.”

His eyes widened slightly, as if that sentence hadn’t existed in his world before.

I held his gaze for a beat, then stepped back. Space mattered. Choice needed air.

“Seven-thirty,” I said, nodding at the paper. “If you’re there, you’re there. If you’re not, I’ll assume you made your decision.”

He swallowed. “You… you won’t be angry?”

I almost smiled. Almost.

“I don’t get angry about other people’s choices,” I said. “I get bored.”

His mouth twitched — the ghost of a smile — then disappeared as quickly as it came. But his shoulders loosened a fraction. Good. Humour, used properly, gave people dignity.

I turned to leave.

Behind me, he spoke — quiet, but clear. “Celeste.”

I stopped without turning. Let him have the floor.

“I… I can do detail,” he said, as if confessing something private. “I can… I can learn fast if someone shows me.”

I turned then, slowly, and looked at him properly.

“I know,” I said. “That’s why I’m not wasting my time.”

His eyes held mine, startled again by the bluntness of being valued.

I nodded once — not encouragement, not praise. A simple acknowledgement that the choice was now his.

Then I walked away, back toward Wardrobe, back into steam and cloth-dust and the woman who didn’t take strays.

And behind me, in the maintenance yard, a boy stood with a folded scrap of paper in his hand, staring at a door he’d never expected to be given.

Not a lifeline.

A lane.

A place he could earn.

And, if he chose it, keep.

[Emily]  
I’m glad it’s landing the way you want — especially the bit you called out: **credibility without softness**, and **authority without speeches**. If Graham feels real *and* likeable while still being “blokey and wrong in imagination,” that’s exactly the sweet spot: the women remain the shaping force, but the world doesn’t turn into a cardboard argument.

And yes: Mara is central now. Once she exists on the page as a standards-driven professional, she becomes the story’s moral infrastructure. Celeste has vision; Mara has praxis. That pairing gives you a spine you can hang *anything* on — including the costume element — without ever letting it become the point.

If you want to use this pause productively (without launching into Scene Four yet), here are three tiny “locking moves” that will preserve what you’re excited about:

1. **Write a one-paragraph “Mara credo”** (for us, not the book): what she will never tolerate; what she secretly respects; what she believes work is for.
2. **Define Graham’s limit**: the moment where even he goes quiet because he realises women are right (not shamed — corrected).
3. **Define Charlie’s first boundary** in Wardrobe: a single line he won’t cross, which Mara respects instantly. That’s how we keep his agency alive.

If you tell me which of those you’d like to nail first, I’ll draft it in the same voice and keep everything on that narrow, rewarding lane.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

























[Q]  
Right.
Graham was a bit player: he did his bit. You wrote him well, but he has served his purpose, for now. He might reappear in futures scenes, but at the moment, it's all about Mara. It's her show. Is it too predictable to insert "one in four women are abused by males" fact to shape her thinking? She is protective of Celeste, intensely so. She feels the same way about the girls she creates garments for. She knows instinctively that Celeste might be a bit naïve about this issue and so she is going to exercise caution around Charlie. It is only (stop me if this DOES NOT work) when she realises Charlie's person, his strong feminine qualities (he is not being effeminate, but he is caring, gentle, has a sense-of-colours, listens and does not intrude, somewhat passive but not a doormat) make him a good fit. She tests this, and he doesn't fail her expectations. His work: no tight stitching: precise, elegant... what Mara hopes for Celeste to develop, Charlie already possesses.
Works?

---

Works — *strongly* — with one important adjustment:

Don’t have Mara *quote* “one in four” (or any statistic) as an on-the-nose line. It risks feeling like an author pamphlet stapled to her dialogue, and Sciamma-lane writing hates that. Mara’s protectiveness will read more powerful if it comes from **lived pattern-recognition** and professional policy rather than a recited fact.

So: **keep the worldview, lose the slogan.** Let the statistic be the *ghost* behind her rules, not a line she speaks.

### Why this works (and why it won’t feel predictable if done right)

#### 1) Mara’s caution around Charlie is professional, not prejudicial

She’s not “man-hating.” She’s running a women-led space where:

* bodies are being fitted,
* privacy is non-negotiable,
* and trust is a workplace safety requirement.

That’s not ideology — it’s risk management.

#### 2) Her “test” should be about boundaries, not about “feminine qualities”

You can absolutely have Mara notice Charlie’s gentleness, colour-sense, and non-intrusiveness — but the core test should be:

* **Can he follow rules without sulking?**
* **Can he keep his eyes where they belong?**
* **Can he take correction without turning it into drama?**
* **Does he respect women’s space automatically?**
* **Does he understand that access is earned, not owed?**

Those are the behaviours that make him safe *and* competent. They also keep the story from sliding into “good boy = feminine,” which could unintentionally confuse your thematic intent.

Think of it this way: Mara isn’t rewarding “femininity.” She’s rewarding **character + discipline** — which happen to align with what she values in craft.

#### 3) Charlie already possessing what Mara hopes Celeste develops is *gold*

That’s not only believable, it’s narratively rich because it flips the expected hierarchy:

* Celeste has vision and leadership,
* Charlie has craft-instinct and quiet elegance,
* Mara is the judge who recognises both.

This creates a triangle where nobody is redundant.

### How to dramatize Mara’s thinking without a speech

Give Mara a rule-set that implicitly says, “I know how men can be,” without her ever sermonising.

Examples of Mara’s *actions* that communicate it:

* She positions fittings behind a curtain and controls who enters.
* She bans phones in certain areas.
* She insists on two-person protocol for specific situations (or the reverse: only women present for fitting).
* She watches Charlie’s eyes more than his hands at first.
* She makes Celeste step back specifically to avoid “favouritism.”

And then: Charlie passes by being exactly who he is.

### The “test” that fits your lane best

A good test is one that looks like ordinary work.

**Test 1: The seam that reveals temperament**
Mara gives him a repair that will pucker if stitched with anxiety. She watches whether he:

* breathes,
* goes slow,
* keeps tension even,
* and stops to rethread rather than forcing.

This ties directly to your “no tight stitching” motif. It’s craft-as-character.

**Test 2: The boundary moment**
A garment comes in that requires work near intimate areas (not described salaciously — just “closure,” “lining,” “fit point”). Mara watches whether he:

* asks where to stand,
* waits for instruction,
* averts his gaze naturally,
* and doesn’t make jokes.

**Test 3: The correction**
She deliberately corrects him sharply once — not unfairly, but bluntly — and watches whether he:

* accepts it without defensiveness,
* doesn’t fish for reassurance,
* and simply improves.

Passing these is what earns him. Not “proving he’s not like other boys” in a speech — just proving it by never triggering the alarms.

### One more tweak to make it sing

Let Mara’s protectiveness of Celeste be *specific* and slightly unsentimental:

* Mara doesn’t worry Celeste will be physically harmed tomorrow.
* Mara worries Celeste will be **subtly compromised**: distracted, guilted, manipulated, made responsible for a boy’s feelings — the thousand small ways women get drained.

So Mara’s caution around Charlie isn’t “male = danger.” It’s “male entitlement is a solvent.” Charlie, being non-entitled, doesn’t dissolve things. He reinforces them.

### A line Mara could say (that implies the statistic without quoting it)

Something like:

> “Girls don’t get to be naïve for free. They pay for it. I’m not letting you pay.”

Or, more workplace-coded:

> “This room stays safe because we keep it that way. No exceptions. Not for anyone.”

Both give you the weight without the PSA.

---

So yes: your concept works. Make Mara’s caution **policy + instinct**, make Charlie’s fit proven through **boundaries + craft**, and keep the “women’s safety” theme embedded in procedure rather than overt numbers.

If you want, I can draft the next scene where Mara begins the “trial shift” and runs those tests — with the seam motif as the centrepiece — and it’ll naturally reveal why she becomes convinced.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

















### Scene Four — *Trial Shift*

Charlie arrived ten minutes early and stood outside Wardrobe like it was a church he wasn’t sure he was allowed to enter.

He didn’t pace. He didn’t scroll his phone. He didn’t look around for someone to rescue him from the act of being there. He just waited, folded scrap of paper in one hand, fingers worrying the edge until it softened. Every now and then he glanced at the door — not to check whether it was locked, but to check whether the world had changed its mind.

Inside, Wardrobe moved the way it always did: rails clacking softly as garments were shifted, the steamer hissing like a restrained animal, the constant quiet conversation between fabric and hands.

Mara spotted him through the small window in the door.

She didn’t react. Reaction was a kind of permission.

She finished what she was doing — pinning a waistband to a mannequin, smoothing the fabric as if it were skin — then wiped her hands on a cloth and nodded toward me without looking.

“Open it.”

I was tempted to step forward, to say something that would make it easier for him, but Mara’s voice from yesterday was still in my ears: *You don’t chase him. You don’t sell it like a lifeline.*

So I opened the door and stood aside, nothing more.

Charlie’s gaze snapped to mine the moment the door moved. He stepped forward, then stopped, like he didn’t trust his feet.

“You’re early,” I said. It came out neutral, the way you’d say *it’s Tuesday*.

He nodded once. “I… I didn’t want to be late.”

“Good,” I said, because that was the correct response. “Come in.”

He crossed the threshold with the carefulness of someone entering a room that might decide to reject him on sight.

Mara didn’t greet him. She didn’t smile. She didn’t soften. She looked at him the way she looked at a bodice seam — assessing the integrity.

“Rossignol,” she said.

Charlie froze slightly. “Yes.”

Mara’s eyes dropped to his hands. “Clean?”

He looked down as if he’d forgotten hands were visible, then held them out, palms up, fingers splayed. They were clean. Nails trimmed short. The skin at the fingertips was slightly rough, as if he did fine work at home.

“Good.” Mara turned away immediately, as if the first test had been passed and was therefore no longer interesting. “Shut the door.”

He did, quietly. No banging. No showing off.

Mara walked to the centre table and picked up a garment bag. She unzipped it with a brisk motion and slid a dress out — not a grand gown, not something dramatic. A simple working dress in sturdy fabric, with a seam splitting near the side closure, the tear held together with hurried, ugly stitches.

She tossed it onto the table.

“This came in yesterday,” Mara said. “Tourist. Borrowed. Sat down too hard. Someone panicked and tried to fix it.” She tapped the seam with one finger. “Look at that.”

Charlie leaned in, careful not to touch until he was sure he was allowed. His eyes did what his eyes always did when something made sense: they became steady.

“The tension’s wrong,” he said, quietly, almost surprised by his own certainty. “It’s pulling.”

Mara’s gaze flicked to him. “Why?”

“They stitched too tight,” he replied. “And they didn’t match the grain. The fabric’s fighting.”

Mara didn’t praise him. She simply moved to the next question. “What do you do?”

Charlie swallowed. “Unpick it. Start again.”

Mara nodded once. “Good. Do it.”

He hesitated. “With… the seam ripper?”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “It’s called a *lame*.”

Charlie blinked. “Right. Sorry. A—”

“Don’t apologise,” Mara said. “Learn.”

He nodded, and the nod wasn’t performative. It was acceptance.

Mara pointed at the far end of the table. “Sit there. Tools are in the tin. Thread is in the drawer. If you use something, you put it back. If you break something, you tell me immediately. If you don’t know, you ask once. Not five times.”

Charlie’s jaw moved, like he was swallowing fear. “Okay.”

Mara’s eyes slid to me. “Celeste.”

I looked up.

“You’re on rails and pins. Not him.” Her tone left no space for negotiation. “You do not hover. You do not translate. You do not rescue. You work.”

“Understood,” I said.

Charlie’s gaze flicked to me — quick, skittish — and I gave him nothing except the simple fact of my presence in the room. I turned away and went to the rails, where a cluster of garments waited like quiet accusations.

Wardrobe did not stop for anyone’s nerves.

Behind me, I heard the soft, careful sound of Charlie taking the lame in hand.

A pause.

Then the tiny snap of thread giving way.

Mara moved around the room as he worked, doing her usual circuit: checking labels, touching fabric, straightening hangers. But her attention had shifted. It wasn’t on the dress. It was on him.

Not his body. Not the shape of him.

His behaviour.

He didn’t hunch over the work like a guilty child. He didn’t look around to see who was watching. He didn’t breathe fast.

He unpicked steadily, patiently, lifting each tight stitch and easing it out as if he was undoing a mistake without punishing the fabric for it.

That, I realised, was what Mara was looking for.

Not skill alone.

Temperament.

After a few minutes, Mara stopped behind him.

“Why are you going slow?” she asked.

Charlie’s shoulders tightened, but he didn’t flinch away. He looked up briefly, then back down at the seam. “Because if I go fast, I’ll tear the fabric.”

Mara’s voice was flat. “And if you tear the fabric?”

“I’ll have to patch it.” He hesitated, then added, like a confession. “It will show.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed slightly. “And you don’t want it to show.”

“No,” Charlie said. Simply. No grand reason. Just standards.

Mara walked away again, as if that answer had been a key turning in a lock.

I pinned a label to a garment bag and listened with half my mind, the way you listen to rain on a roof — constant, background, meaningful.

Charlie’s tools made small sounds: metal clicking, thread whispering. His breathing stayed even.

After he’d unpicked the seam completely, he didn’t immediately reach for thread. He smoothed the fabric with his palm, slow and light, as if calming it. Then he looked up and spoke, voice soft but clear.

“Mara?”

Mara’s head turned. “Yes.”

He held up the dress slightly. “The original seam allowance is… narrow. If I stitch it the way it is, it’ll hold, but it will be under stress. If I reinforce it from the inside with a strip of fabric — like a facing — it’ll take the load.”

Mara walked over and looked. Charlie did not move his hands to demonstrate on her body. He indicated the seam in the air above the fabric, precise and respectful, as if the dress itself deserved dignity.

Mara’s eyes sharpened. “Where would you put the strip?”

Charlie pointed to the inside layer, fingers hovering, not grabbing. “Here. Along the closure line. It won’t show. It’ll stop it tearing again.”

Mara stared at him for a beat longer than necessary.

Then she said, “Do it.”

Charlie let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding and nodded. Not grateful. Focused.

He reached for the drawer, selected a strip of fabric, measured it twice before cutting once. His movements were economical. Not flamboyant. Not fussy. Careful in a way that made you trust him without having to decide to.

Mara watched him for a few minutes, then spoke again, to the room rather than to him.

“This is how you sew,” she said, sharply, as if correcting an invisible crowd. “Not with fear. Not with speed. With respect.”

I kept my eyes on the rails, but the words settled in my chest.

Not just about thread.

About everything.

A little while later, Mara brought over a small tin and set it down near Charlie’s elbow.

“Needles,” she said. “Choose the right one.”

Charlie glanced at the tin, then at the fabric, then back. He picked a needle that matched the weight — neither too fine nor too thick — and threaded it on the first try. His hands didn’t shake.

Mara noticed. Of course she did.

“Do you sew at home?” she asked, as if the question cost her nothing.

Charlie’s mouth tightened. “Sometimes.”

“Who taught you?”

Charlie hesitated. “My mum. She… she does alterations sometimes. For neighbours. For money.”

Mara’s gaze softened by half a millimetre — so little you could miss it if you weren’t watching for it.

“Right,” she said. “So you know what work is.”

Charlie didn’t answer, because people like him didn’t know how to accept a statement like that without turning it into an apology.

Mara didn’t give him the chance.

She tapped the table. “When you’re finished, you’ll bring it to me. And if it’s still puckered, you’ll unpick it again.”

Charlie nodded. “Okay.”

No sulk. No protest.

Just work.

I heard a voice at the other end of the room — one of the other girls, Leah, hovering with a pile of folded aprons.

“Mara,” Leah said cautiously, eyes darting to Charlie and away again. “Is… is he—”

Mara didn’t look up. “He’s working.”

Leah’s mouth opened, then shut. She glanced at me, searching for cues.

I gave her none.

Mara looked up then, and her gaze pinned Leah the way a pin fixes fabric: precise, inescapable.

“Do you have a problem with someone doing their job?” Mara asked.

Leah flushed. “No.”

“Good.” Mara’s voice was mild, which made it more dangerous. “Then do yours.”

Leah scuttled away like a mouse escaping a cat.

Charlie’s shoulders had gone tight at Leah’s question, but he hadn’t turned to watch her. He hadn’t sought sympathy. He kept stitching, eyes on the line, as if the only safe place in the world was the next correct stitch.

That was… telling.

And, in a strange way, promising.

A while later, Mara moved to the far side of the room and pulled a curtain partway across a doorway. Behind it was the fitting area — a small section partitioned off from the main space. Not hidden, exactly. Controlled.

She spoke without raising her voice. “Rossignol.”

Charlie looked up immediately. “Yes?”

“Stop,” Mara said. “Bring me the dress.”

Charlie set the needle down exactly where it belonged, smoothed the thread, and carried the dress over with both hands as if it could bruise.

Mara took it, examined the seam with her fingertips, turned it inside-out, then right side out again. She tugged lightly near the closure.

The seam held. It lay flat.

It looked as if it had never been damaged.

Mara did not smile.

But she nodded once.

“Acceptable,” she said.

Charlie’s breath stuttered, then steadied again. He didn’t glow. He didn’t grin. He simply stood there, waiting for the next instruction like someone who didn’t trust praise to survive sudden movement.

Mara looked at him.

Not the dress.

Him.

“What happens if you make a mistake in here?” she asked.

Charlie blinked. “I… I fix it.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “And if you can’t fix it?”

“I tell you,” he said quickly. “Immediately.”

“And if you don’t tell me?”

Charlie swallowed. “Then I’m… out.”

Mara leaned slightly closer. Her voice dropped, not to intimidate but to make the next part land.

“Yes,” she said. “You’re out. Because this room stays safe because we keep it that way.”

Charlie’s eyes widened a fraction — as if the word *safe* had been unexpected, as if he’d assumed the rules were only about fabric.

Mara held his gaze.

“Do you understand me?”

“Yes,” he said, hoarse.

Mara straightened. “Good.”

She turned her head slightly. “Celeste.”

I looked over.

“Show him the inventory shelf,” Mara said. “Then you go back to rails. He does not follow you. You point. He listens. You don’t chat.”

I nodded. “Come on,” I said to Charlie.

Charlie glanced at Mara as if to confirm he was allowed to move, then followed me at a respectful distance — not crowding, not trying to be close.

I stopped at the shelves and pointed out the labelled boxes: hooks, pins, tapes, ribbons, boning, eyelets. I kept my voice low and factual. Not teaching. Not nurturing. Just orienting.

Charlie’s eyes tracked everything. He didn’t touch unless he was told. He was absorbing the room the way he absorbed my instructions in the toilets: as if someone giving him structure was a form of oxygen.

When I finished, I stepped back. “That’s it.”

He nodded once. “Okay.”

And then, because he couldn’t help it, because his brain was precise and his honesty was inconvenient, he asked, quietly:

“Does she… hate me?”

It wasn’t a plea. It was data-gathering.

I kept my face neutral. “Mara doesn’t hate people,” I said. “She hates time-wasting.”

His shoulders loosened a fraction, as if he’d been holding his breath since he walked in.

“Right,” he murmured.

Mara called across the room again. “Rossignol.”

Charlie turned instantly. “Yes.”

“Pins,” Mara said. “Sort by size. If you mix them, I’ll know.”

Charlie moved without hesitation, took the tin, and began to sort, methodical and silent.

I went back to the rails.

Wardrobe resumed its normal rhythm around him, as if the room had tested him and decided — provisionally — that he was not a contaminant.

After another half hour, Mara’s voice cut through the steady hiss of steam.

“Rossignol.”

Charlie looked up.

Mara’s eyes held him. “Come back tomorrow at seven-thirty.”

Charlie went still.

“Tomorrow?” he repeated, as if the word had weight.

Mara lifted an eyebrow. “If you want.”

Charlie swallowed. He glanced down at his hands, then up again. The choice was there, hanging between them like a garment on a hook.

“I want,” he said.

Mara’s gaze didn’t soften, but something in her posture eased — like a seam that had finally stopped fighting.

“Good,” she said. “Then don’t be late.”

Charlie nodded once. “I won’t.”

Mara turned away as if the matter was settled.

It was.

Not because she’d rescued him.

Because she’d tested him.

And, for the first time in a long time, he hadn’t been found wanting.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">



















[Q]  
Good. That was crisp. Tight. Exactly where we want the tone to be, at the outset. NOW question, Emily. Is it unrealistic for Mara's tone to soften towards Charlie as she gets to know him, and finds him to be more and more of an asset? Women enjoy/promote comraderie: I felt it as a nurse and the girls all said that despite my being, as they say, AMAB, they saw me as one of them, a fellow girl. That is MY lived experience... women are wonderful that way. Can it be Charlie's, eventually?

---

Not unrealistic at all — it’s *almost inevitable* if you build it the way you’ve started: **standards first, warmth earned.** In fact, the softening will feel *more* authentic precisely because Mara begins hard-edged and procedural. When she relaxes, the reader will trust it.

The key is to make Mara’s shift **behavioral**, not “suddenly nurturing.” She doesn’t become cuddly; she becomes *less guarded* because Charlie keeps proving, day after day, that he doesn’t consume women’s space — he contributes to it.

### Why it’s believable (in-world and psychologically)

Women’s camaraderie often has an unspoken membership rule:
**Do you make the room safer, lighter, more capable — or do you drain it?**

Charlie, as you’re writing him, is the rare male-bodied person who:

* listens without intruding,
* works without performing,
* accepts correction without sulking,
* doesn’t sexualize,
* and doesn’t treat access to women’s space as entitlement.

That combination is exactly what makes “one of us” possible over time — not because of biology, but because of *conduct* and *values*.

Your lived experience fits this perfectly: women aren’t naively inclusive; they’re *socially intelligent*. They can recognize who is safe, who is helpful, who respects boundaries, and who doesn’t.

### How to do it without breaking the tone

You’re in a narrow lane, so the softening should come in **small, utilitarian gifts** rather than big emotional declarations.

Examples of Mara “softening” that still feel like Mara:

* She stops calling him “Rossignol” and starts calling him “Charlie” (rare, deliberate).
* She starts giving him slightly harder tasks *without announcing it* (trust as responsibility).
* She corrects him less with anger and more with “do it again” calm.
* She saves him time: leaves a spool out because she knows what he’ll need.
* She shields him from a thoughtless comment with a single sentence, then moves on.
* She shares one personal detail accidentally (“My first mentor was worse than me.”) and immediately returns to work.

Warmth is shown as **inclusion into the workflow**, not hugs.

### Make the camaraderie feel earned and specific

Give Charlie the “membership tests” that matter in women’s spaces:

1. **Discretion**
   He sees something private (a fitting mishap, a wardrobe emergency) and never repeats it. Not once.

2. **No entitlement**
   He never assumes he gets access. He waits to be invited; he doesn’t take.

3. **Emotional labour refusal**
   He doesn’t demand women soothe him about being there. He manages himself.

4. **Defends the standard, not his ego**
   If a bloke visitor makes a crude remark, Charlie doesn’t puff up to be a “hero.” He backs Mara’s rule: “Not here.”

5. **Contributes to other women’s dignity**
   He fixes something that makes a girl feel secure in costume — a closure that won’t pop, a seam that won’t rub — and he treats it as normal, not intimate.

Each pass deepens trust, and trust naturally becomes camaraderie.

### The one thing to avoid

Don’t make it “they accept him because he’s feminine.” That can accidentally imply that only “feminine-coded” men are safe or worthy.

Instead: **they accept him because he behaves with respect and competence, and because he strengthens the women’s culture rather than exploiting it.**

His gentleness can be part of that, but it’s not the ticket. The ticket is *character*.

### A beautiful Mara arc (still Mara)

* Early: “I don’t take strays. I take workers.”
* Middle: “He’s not yours, Celeste. He’s mine to train.”
* Later: “Charlie, tea. Then back to it.” (and the whole room hears the pronoun shift without fanfare)

2. a later “she claims him as part of Wardrobe” moment (quiet, powerful).
