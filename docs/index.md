Celeste explains to Charlie (she calls him 'Sharl', like, short for 'Charlemagne?') about genetics and human development at the embryonic stages, as she understands it. Her explanation is over-simplified - chromosomes matter - but it serves the purpose. Charlie is besotted with her and unquestioningly accepts any wisdom she may share with him.
  
This bit did leave him a bit perturbed, of course.
  
He failed to comprehend what she was driving at with this, and, in the story, just the mere notion overwhelmed him.

**Side Note:**  
*This discussion ensued during his inital days at the Faire (in a former version). The 'Celeste's Girl' story is currently seeing the light of day on [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/celestesgrl/gallery/99567967/the-story). What is published there will actually be revised again. The start of the story on this site is [here](/Charlotte/CG-Book-One.md)*.

## Foreword

These pages explore the cancelling of a full one-half of humans through a cruel, unjust mindset called the 'patriarchy'. In them I share a story based on that theme, with information I'm sort-of picking up chatting with Emily (ChatGPT).

Hope to learn more about life **for women** in the 1880s (19th Century), the Victorian Period.

The image and the video were created using ComfyUI as my Stable Diffusion interface because of its flexibility and power through the use of nodes.

Note: *I'm also exploring other avenues, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to create stories and refine my own pathetic text into something readable. However, as I wrote on the Unofficial Audio at The Edge Discord today*:

Stylewise, I was going to go with something like Taffy Brodesser-Akner's, but it's too distinctively hers to even emulate. That's not what I want to do. I want readability, that's all. And my "style" is awkward and disjointed.

So, there's that. 🫢

**Guiding Principles**

This story is at about middle of Act Two of my 'story arc'. As in: far from done. And it's a story with a purpose: agency, respect, consent, safety. Protect the vulnerable. No one gets to dominate, or coerce, or exercise privilege at Wardrobe. There's no spectacle to ogle, no objectification of persons permitted. 
Does it happen? yes. But there are  consequences because: standards. Policy. 

It makes this story a bit different, and for some, send an uncomfortable message. I doubt it would translate into like a comics format well. 

I'm not writing to get paid: I'm writing from a moral imperative.

About my images and stories
 

The Celeste’s Girl / Wardrobe images and stories are part of a long, carefully structured arc. They’re built around a few non-negotiables: agency, respect, consent, safety, and protection of the vulnerable.

No one at Wardrobe is there to be ogled or objectified. Desire exists, but domination, coercion, and privilege do not get a free pass. When harm happens, there are consequences, because there are standards.

I’m not writing to get paid or to feed a fetish market; I’m writing from a moral imperative. That means:

I’m not looking for collaborators, co-writers, or “let’s make this a comic” proposals.

I’m very protective of the tone and purpose of this work; it would not translate to a visual format without compromising those values.

If you enjoy the stories as they are and want to talk about themes, characters, or craft, you’re very welcome. If you’re here to pitch projects or to steer the content somewhere more objectifying, we’re probably not a match.

270Jan-2026: The image in the header is setting the stage for Act 3 of Celeste's Girl... at least, that's what I'm imagining now. There might be enough story fuel to write a whole new story. Dunno. 

26-Jan-2026: took inspiration for any small effort at music from several obscure composers, one being Carl Reinecke. This is the last movement (6) from his Serenade for Strings in G.

21-Jan-2026: Just editing all the scenes again, because... of course I am. Adding images and firming things up. Sarah is a hard one to create a consistent character of, even using a LoRA.  However, Emily and I cracked the code for getting consistent characters last night.
I think.
I hope.

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':
