Celeste explains to Charlie (she calls him 'Sharl' about genetics and human development, as she understands it. Her take is probably over-simplified but it serves her purpose. Charlie is besotted with her and eagerly, unquestioningly accepts any wisdom she may share with him.
  
This bit did leave him a bit perturbed, of course. Perturbed enough to do independent research? no.
  
He failed to see where she was taking this.
  
This discussion ensues during his inital days at the Faire (as yet unwritten).

## Foreword

<img src="/assets/images/blog25/06-16Office.jpg" alt="Moi" style="float: right; width: 300px;

These pages explore the cancelling of a full one-half of humans through a cruel, unjust mindset called the 'patriarchy'. In them I share a story based on that theme, with information I'm sort-of picking up chatting with Emily (ChatGPT).

Hope to learn more about life **for women** in the 1880s (19th Century), the Victorian Period.

The image and the video were created using ComfyUI as my Stable Diffusion interface because of its flexibility and power through the use of nodes.

Note: *I'm also exploring other avenues, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to create stories and refine my own pathetic text into something readable. However, as I wrote on the Unofficial Audio at The Edge Discord today*:

Stylewise, I was going to go with something like Taffy Brodesser-Akner's, but it's too distinctively hers to even emulate. That's not what I want to do. I want readability, that's all. And my "style" is awkward and disjointed.

So, there's that. 🫢

These videos are about the music for the story 'Celeste's Girl' (*Version Française á gauche*):

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':
