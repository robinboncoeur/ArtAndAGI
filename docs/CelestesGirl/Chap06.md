Your request is clear, Robyn! Transitioning from E# major to D major can be a fascinating modulation, and it’s great that you’re exploring this in your orchestral piece. Although E# major is enharmonically equivalent to F major, I’ll work with the concept of E# major for clarity. Here are four chord progressions that will help you modulate from E# major to D major:


## Progression 1: Classical Modulation
1. E# major (I)
2. G# minor (iii)
3. C# major (VI)
4. F# minor (ii)
5. B# diminished (vii°) (leading tone diminished seventh of D major)
6. D major (I)

## Progression 2: Chromatic Modulation
1. E# major (I)
2. A# minor (iv)
3. B# diminished (vii°)
4. C# major (VI)
5. F# minor (ii)
6. A7 (V7 of D major)
7. D major (I)

## Progression 3: Secondary Dominant Modulation
1. E# major (I)
2. B# major (V/V)
3. F# major (V)
4. B7 (V7 of E minor)
5. E minor (vi) 
6. A7 (V7 of D major)
7. D major (I)

## Progression 4: Common Tone Modulation
1. E# major (I)
2. C# major (VI)
3. G# major (V/V of D major)
4. D# diminished (vii° of E minor)
5. G major (IV in D major)
6. D major (I)
