## POV-Celeste

I understand *exactly* what you mean, and you’re not stating the obvious at all — you’re naming the single most important guardrail that will keep the story intelligent, women-centred, and immune to the prurient “reward loop.”

You want the “companion (including costume)” moment to read as:

* **logistical**,
* **professionally necessary**,
* **ethically framed**, and
* **emotionally complex in the *right* direction** (agency, trust, identity pressure, social meaning),

…and to be such a **non-event erotically** that anyone arriving hungry for titillation feels quietly accused of being in the wrong room.

That’s absolutely achievable — and actually easier than it sounds if you treat costume as *workwear* and keep the gaze where you want it.

---

## 1) Mara as ongoing foil: yes, but evolve her function

Mara can absolutely stay a foil, but she shouldn’t remain a one-note “bitter mean girl,” because that becomes melodrama.

Instead, let her evolve into a more interesting kind of pressure:

### Mara’s foil modes (pick 2–3 over the arc)

**Mode A: Gatekeeper of Wardrobe**

* Not personal hatred so much as territorial vigilance.
* She resents “donor kid Celeste” and resents “random boy” twice over.
* She tests process, not morality: “Did you log that? Did you label that?”

**Mode B: Mirror of what women endure**

* Mara is what happens when a woman survives by becoming hard.
* She has internalised the world’s contempt and repackages it as “standards.”
* She becomes a living argument for your lived-experience theme.

**Mode C: Reluctant ally**

* Once Charlie proves competence and discretion, Mara’s hostility shifts from “boys get weird” to “fine, he’s useful.”
* She never becomes warm. She becomes fair.
* That arc is satisfying and grounded.

**Mode D: Celeste’s accountability check**

* Mara calls Celeste out when she overreaches: “You’re making him dependent.”
* This gives the story moral tension without preaching.

So yes: keep Mara around, but let her become **a pressure system**, not a cartoon antagonist.

---

## 2) Making “Charlie in costume” a prurient non-event

Here are the principles that will inoculate the scene:

### Principle 1: Frame it as uniform, not transformation

Language matters. Nobody says “dress him up.” They say:

* “You’re in kit.”
* “You’re on the floor; you need correct layers.”
* “You can’t represent Wardrobe in jeans.”

And it’s about **role clarity**.

### Principle 2: Keep the gaze clinical and craft-based

The camera (your prose) doesn’t linger on “revealing” anything. It lingers on:

* seams, fit, movement, comfort,
* pin placement,
* the ethics of garments (chafing, breathing, heat).

The body is treated as **a worker’s body**, not an object.

### Principle 3: Charlie’s internality is not arousal; it’s social physics

His feelings should be:

* hyper-awareness of being seen,
* fear of being misread,
* discomfort with imposed meaning,
* and that dangerous relief when Celeste’s framing makes him functional.

If he’s overwhelmed, it’s because of **identity pressure and public interpretation**, not “thrill.”

### Principle 4: Celeste makes it deliberately unsexy — almost pointedly so

She chooses:

* practical underlayers,
* neutral colours,
* flat shoes,
* hair fully pinned,
* no “pretty” touches.

She can even say, dryly:

> “This isn’t cosplay. This is labour.”

That’s your implied accusation.

### Principle 5: The scene denies the “spectacle payoff”

No audience catcalling. No giggling. No lingering mirror shot.

If there’s a mirror, it’s used like this:

* “Check your collar. Now move.”
  Not:
* “Admire yourself.”

### Principle 6: Women’s boundaries and safety are explicit

This is crucial to your antidote. Celeste sets boundaries like policy:

* “No one comments on bodies in Wardrobe.”
* “No one touches without asking.”
* “If anyone sexualises you, they’re out.”

That flips the usual dynamic: the space polices the prurient, not the wearer.

---

## 3) The “non-event” structure that works best

You want the costume shift to happen in a way that *starves* the wrong reading.

**Best structure:**

* It occurs mid-crisis, under time pressure.
* It’s solved with competence.
* After it’s done, everyone moves on.

Something like:

1. A public-facing wardrobe role opens suddenly (someone vomits, heatstroke, ripped trousers, missing staff).
2. Celeste says: “Charlie, you’re on the floor. You need kit.”
3. He starts to protest; she cuts it off: “This is not about you. This is about the job.”
4. A fast, procedural dressing sequence: layers, pin, tie, move.
5. He steps out; no one reacts like it’s special.
6. The sting: Charlie realises *this is what women live with* — being read, misread, commented on — and Celeste has built a system that refuses that reading.

That makes the prurient reader feel like they brought the wrong eyes.

---

## 4) A couple of lines that do the “implied accusation” work

These are small, lethal, and they keep your tone:

* **Celeste:** “If you’re hoping this is a moment, it isn’t. It’s Tuesday.”
* **Celeste:** “You’re not here to be looked at. You’re here to make sure nobody *can* look away when something fails.”
* **Celeste:** “This uniform doesn’t feminise anyone. It professionalises you.”

And one for Charlie that nails your theme:

* **Charlie (internal):** *He hadn’t changed. The meaning had. And meaning was the heavier garment.*

---

If you want, I can write the **first “costume-from-the-skin-out” scene** as that procedural, crisis-driven non-event — with Mara present as the sceptical gatekeeper, and with Celeste’s language making it unmistakably *not* a fantasy beat.

*(Celeste POV)*


## Celeste — The Non-Event

The crisis arrived the way all crises do: not with drama, but with a small failure that refused to stay small.

A runner burst into Wardrobe with the wrong kind of breath—too fast, too thin. “Celeste—”

I didn’t look up from the rack I was auditing. “If you say my name like that, you’re about to waste my time. Try again.”

He blinked, recalibrated. “Mrs. Tolland can’t go on.”

“Why?”

“She—” He swallowed. “Heat. She’s dizzy. She sat down in the shade and Mara’s saying she’s done for the morning.”

Behind him, Mara appeared, lips pressed tight, already irritated that reality had inconvenienced her. “She’s not going back out in stays in this weather. She nearly fainted in front of the apothecary cart. We’re pulling her.”

“Fine,” I said, because *fine* is the sound a strategist makes when a piece leaves the board.

Wardrobe did not stop because one person’s body had limits. Wardrobe adjusted.

I flipped my clipboard. Mrs. Tolland—female interpreter, high visibility, VIP path at ten-fifteen. If she didn’t appear, the patrons would. Patrons always do.

“What’s on her track?” I asked.

“The school group tour. The donors’ morning tea,” Mara said, as if she were reading from a death certificate. “She’s the only one who can do the weaving demonstration *and* the ‘ladies’ domestic’ script without sounding like a brochure.”

I stared at the schedule and felt the room tilt—not emotionally, but operationally.

Ten-fifteen. Nine-fifty-two now.

“Alright,” I said. “We need someone on the floor who can run continuity and keep the illusion intact. Someone who doesn’t flap.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to Charlie before mine did, like her suspicion had a reflex.

“No,” she said instantly. “No.”

I looked up. “I haven’t even suggested anyone.”

“You will,” she replied. “And it will be him.”

Charlie was at the central table, finishing a button replacement on a footman’s waistcoat. He’d been working with clean hands and quiet concentration, head bowed, as if the world could be held together by stitches if he just made them correct.

He looked up at the edge in Mara’s voice and froze. The old instinct: *become small when you’re spoken about.*

I didn’t allow it.

“Charlie,” I said, calm.

His eyes snapped to mine, immediate. Waiting.

Good.

I turned back to Mara. “He’s the only person in this room I can put on the floor who will do exactly what he’s told and not improvise morality.”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “He’s a boy.”

“He’s a worker,” I corrected. “And he’s already been more disciplined than half your performers.”

Mara’s nostrils flared. This wasn’t really about Charlie. It was about me taking a piece from a board she thought she controlled.

“The donors are not here to watch you play sociology,” she said.

“They’re here to watch the Faire not fail,” I said. “And I’m not playing anything.”

I looked at Charlie again. “Stand up.”

He stood.

He did it a beat too quickly—obedience without confidence—but he didn’t apologise for it. He just waited.

“Wardrobe rule one?” I asked.

He didn’t even have to think now. “Touch garments like they’re alive.”

“And rule two?”

“No apologies,” he said, then corrected himself with more precision. “No confessional. No apologising.”

“Good,” I said. “New rule.”

His face tightened slightly. He was listening.

“You’re going on the floor,” I said. “That means you need kit.”

Mara made a sound like a cough. “Oh, for—Celeste—”

I cut it cleanly, without raising my voice. “Mara. We are not doing theatre.”

Mara stared at me.

I held her gaze until her eyes flicked away first, furious.

Charlie’s face had gone pale.

He opened his mouth.

I lifted one finger.

He closed it again. He swallowed. He waited.

That was the trust. Not blind. Not unthinking. Active: he was choosing to hold still and let me steer.

“Listen carefully,” I said to him, because this was the moment where framing mattered more than fabric. “This is not a moment. It is a job. You are not being dressed up. You are being uniformed.”

He blinked, as if the words had changed the physics of the room.

“You will not be looked at,” I continued, brisk. “You will not be commented on. And if anyone tries, they will learn what Wardrobe does to people who confuse bodies with entertainment.”

Mara’s mouth twitched. Almost approval, instantly strangled.

Charlie’s throat bobbed. “Okay.”

I nodded at the sink. “Wash.”

He did, immediately. Properly. No show.

While he dried his hands, I moved to the appropriate section: not lace, not softness, not anything that invited the wrong kind of attention. Plain linen. Neutral wool. Practical layers that read as period and functional.

Wardrobe has a way of stripping meaning from garments when you treat them as equipment. That was the whole point.

I pulled out a linen undershirt, a waistcoat, and a sturdy outer coat. Then, because authenticity matters, I added the correct breeches and stockings. Nothing delicate. Nothing coy. Just the uniform of a working interpreter.

Charlie returned from the sink and stopped at the table like he’d reached the edge of a cliff.

He looked at the pile and then looked away quickly, as if looking too long would be a crime.

I didn’t let that shame set roots.

“Eyes on me,” I said.

He looked up.

“This,” I said, tapping the linen, “is cloth. It serves a body. It is not a comment about the body. Understood?”

He swallowed. “Yes.”

“Good. Now—arms up.”

He did it.

No flourish. No embarrassment performance. Just compliance with a task.

Mara stepped in, impatient despite herself. “If he’s going on the donor path, his hair can’t be doing… whatever that is.”

Charlie’s fingers twitched toward his fringe as if he’d been accused.

I gave Mara a look. “Tie it back.”

“I can,” Charlie said quickly, then stopped himself as if volunteering was dangerous.

I gestured to a simple ribbon. “Do it.”

He tied his hair back with awkward care, not trying to look pretty, just trying to obey the instruction.

While he did that, I laid out the clothing like a procedure: left to right, inside to outside. I didn’t narrate it as transformation. I narrated it as steps.

“Undershirt first,” I said. “Then stockings. Then breeches. Then waistcoat. Then coat. Shoes last.”

Charlie stared at the order, then at me. “Where… do I change?”

Mara’s lips parted as if to deliver something sharp.

I answered first.

“Behind the screen,” I said, pointing to the folding screen in the corner. “No one comes past it. If anyone tries, they get removed. That’s policy.”

Charlie’s shoulders dropped by a fraction, relief with teeth in it.

He moved behind the screen.

I turned away—not because I was being coy, but because this wasn’t intimate. It was important. The body was a body. The garment was a garment. Privacy was a tool, not a mood.

Mara hovered beside me, watching the screen like she expected a circus act. “He’ll freak out.”

“He won’t,” I said.

“How do you know?”

Because he isn’t actually frightened of cloth, I thought. He’s frightened of what people *do* with meaning.

Out loud, I said, “Because he’s disciplined.”

We heard fabric shift. Buttons. The soft scrape of a shoe being removed. The tiny pause where someone tries to work out an unfamiliar closure.

Charlie’s voice came from behind the screen, careful. “The breeches tie… they go…?”

I didn’t roll my eyes. I didn’t sigh. He was allowed one question.

“Side ties first,” I said. “Then front. Keep it flat.”

A beat.

“Okay,” he said.

When he stepped out from behind the screen, he looked like someone wearing a uniform for the first time: not transformed, not “made into” anything—just arranged. Period-correct. Practical. A young interpreter ready to walk and carry and fetch and keep things from failing.

He still looked like Charlie.

Only now, the world would try to read him differently. That was the heavier garment.

I walked around him once, checking fit like a mechanic checks bolts.

“Arms up,” I said.

He lifted them.

“Turn.”

He turned.

The waistcoat sat right. The coat didn’t pull. The breeches were cleanly tied. He moved without looking like he was about to come apart.

Mara made a grudging noise. “Huh.”

I ignored her.

I adjusted one seam at his shoulder with two fingers. Brief contact. Precise. Non-negotiable.

Charlie went still at my touch, then forced himself not to. He breathed. He held.

Good.

“Shoes,” I said.

He stepped into them. I handed him a small pouch—basic tools, spare pins, thread. Not a prop. A necessity.

“This stays on you,” I said. “If you lose it, we have a conversation.”

He nodded, serious. “Okay.”

Now the crucial part: the non-event made explicit.

I looked him in the eye and said, “Do not perform this.”

His brow furrowed. “What do you mean?”

“I mean,” I said, calm, “you are not going to walk out there acting like you’re a joke. You are not going to apologise for wearing a uniform. You are not going to invite commentary with your face.”

He swallowed. “So… just… normal.”

“Exactly,” I said. “Normal. Competent. Quiet.”

Mara scoffed. “Quiet, sure. He’s got that down.”

I let my gaze flick to her—one clean warning.

Mara shut her mouth.

I turned back to Charlie.

“You will say one sentence today,” I told him. “Only one, unless I instruct otherwise.”

His eyes widened slightly. “What sentence?”

I gave it to him like a tool.

“If anyone asks who you are, you say: *I’m Wardrobe support. Talk to Celeste.*”

He repeated it silently.

“Say it,” I said.

He said it aloud. It came out steadier than I expected.

“Again,” I said.

Again. Better.

“Good,” I said. “Now—walk.”

He hesitated at the doorway. The world waited outside, full of eyes and assumptions.

I didn’t soften. Softness would make this seem like a personal rite. It wasn’t. It was Tuesday.

I stepped close enough that only he could hear me.

“If you feel strange,” I said, low, “remember: you haven’t changed. The meaning has. And meaning is not your job. The job is your job.”

Charlie’s throat moved. He nodded once. Deeply. Not worship. Understanding.

We stepped out into the day.

The yard didn’t stop.

No one whistled. No one laughed. No one clapped. A couple of workers glanced over and then returned to hammering, because the world is usually too busy to care if you don’t invite it to.

Charlie walked beside me, posture still careful but no longer collapsing. He held the pouch at his hip as if it belonged there. He matched my pace without being told.

Mara trailed behind, watching for failure the way some people watch for weather.

We passed the apothecary cart. We passed the bakery stall. We passed a group of girls in modern clothes who stared at the actors with the hungry curiosity of tourists.

A man on a bench—a patron—looked up and opened his mouth, ready to make some comment about “authenticity” or “pretty costumes” or whatever nonsense men offer the world when they want it to smile at them.

He saw my face and thought better of it.

He looked away.

Charlie noticed. I felt it in the tiny change beside me—his awareness of danger, his relief at its deflection.

He didn’t smile. He didn’t shrink. He simply kept walking.

Good.

That was the real non-event: not that he wore layers of cloth, but that he wore them without offering himself up as a spectacle.

And as we moved toward the donor path, I realised something with the same clean click I’d felt reading his name on the roster.

It wasn’t that Charlie could be placed anywhere.

It was that, when he trusted my frame, he could move through the world without being eaten by other people’s interpretations.

That kind of steadiness was rare.

And rare things, once acquired, are difficult to let go.
