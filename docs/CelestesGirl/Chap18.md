# Scene 18

All right — here’s **Scene 18** as the next clean step: **Rung Three**, with a “stupid comment” arriving from the outside world *without* hijacking the scene into theatre. Charlie keeps his hands. The women keep the room. And we slip in one more quiet “numbers” seed so Scene 19 can turn naturally into *The Numbers* without feeling bolted on.

# Scene 18 — “Third Rung” (Celeste POV)

Mara didn’t call it “third rung” until she’d already arranged it.

She treated it the way she treated everything else: as a variable you introduced on purpose, not a chaos you endured.

The atelier looked almost ordinary now—if you ignored the wall of blocks and the ledger that had become a kind of second spine. Labels had started appearing on everything: rolls of tape, drawers of grommets, the brown-card templates clipped and hung like tools instead of mysteries.

Lauren had brought a box of index tabs and, without fanfare, had started turning Mara’s wild ecosystem into something you could scale without losing your mind.

Mara didn’t thank her.

She left the tabs where they were and kept working, which was Mara’s version of endorsement.

Charlie stood at the cutting table with the stays pattern pinned and smoothed. Chalk in hand. Shoulders down. Breathing like a person.

He looked—dangerously—almost calm.

Mara tapped the table once.

“Third rung,” she said, flat.

Charlie blinked. “Someone says something stupid.”

Mara’s eyes flicked up. A microscopic nod. Yes. He’d listened.

“And you keep your hands,” she added.

Sarah, leaning on the shelving, made a pleased little sound—as if this rung had been made for her.

Lauren cut in gently, before Sarah could take it as entertainment.

“Remember,” she said, warm and steady, “you’re not winning an argument. You’re practising staying in the work.”

Charlie’s mouth tightened. He nodded once, and returned to the line.

Mara didn’t look at Sarah.

She didn’t need to.

The rule was already in place.

“Colleague,” Lauren reminded, lightly.

Sarah’s lips twitched. “Colleague,” she echoed, as if it tasted strange.

The chalk moved. The waistline mark appeared. The grainline followed. Charlie’s hand was steady enough now that the work looked like work, not like bravery.

Mara watched for drift. Lauren watched his shoulders. I watched the room.

And then the outside arrived—quietly, like it always does.

A voice from the doorway.

“Well,” it said, with the casual confidence of someone who’d never had to earn a place in a room full of women. “This is… new.”

Graham stood just beyond the threshold with a clipboard under his arm, an invoice tucked into it like a badge. He didn’t step in. He didn’t need to. The comment was already inside.

His eyes moved—automatically—toward Charlie, then toward the stays pattern, and his mouth did the lazy thing men’s mouths do when they think the world is theirs to narrate.

“Didn’t know you’d started hiring lads for ladies’—” he made a vague gesture, as if the garment didn’t deserve a name, “—gear.”

Charlie’s chalk stopped for half a heartbeat.

I felt the room tighten, not with fear, but with focus.

Mara didn’t move. She didn’t rise to it. She didn’t give him a big consequence *yet*.

She did something sharper.

She glanced at Charlie.

Not as comfort. As instruction.

**Keep your hands.**

Lauren spoke first, because Lauren’s warmth was not softness—it was steering.

“Hi, Graham,” she said, pleasant as sunshine. “You’re standing on the wrong side of the door for commentary.”

Graham blinked, surprised to find an adult voice already on him.

“It was a joke,” he said, as if that absolved everything.

Sarah made a small sound—half laugh, half snort—then caught herself. Her eyes flicked to Mara, and Mara didn’t even look up.

Colleague.

Charlie’s chalk resumed.

He didn’t turn. He didn’t flare. He didn’t shrink.

He drew the line as if the line mattered more than the world.

Graham tried again, because men often do.

“You lot are serious about this, aren’t you?”

Charlie’s hand stayed moving.

His voice, when it came, was quiet and factual, like a note in the ledger.

“Prototype testing,” he said. “Scheduled work.”

He didn’t look up.

He didn’t invite a reply.

He returned to the chalk as if language was just another tool you used briefly and then put away.

Lauren’s mouth twitched—the smallest sign of approval.

Mara finally lifted her eyes to Graham.

Her tone didn’t rise. It didn’t need to.

“Invoice goes on the hook,” she said. “If you have a question about orders, you ask me. If you have an opinion about my staff, you keep it.”

Graham’s face tightened.

He looked for the crack in the room—the place where a man could push and be indulged.

There wasn’t one.

He cleared his throat, suddenly very aware of the boundary he’d been allowed to stand behind.

“Right,” he said, clipped now. “Museum called again.”

Mara’s attention sharpened. Not because she cared about his tone—because the word *museum* was a number disguised as a noun.

“What did they say?”

Graham glanced at the clipboard. “They want another run. More sizes. They’re happy. They’re… impressed.”

Sarah’s brows lifted. Lauren’s expression didn’t change, but her eyes did that thing adults’ eyes do when they’re already calculating logistics.

Mara nodded once, as if she’d expected it.

“Good,” she said. “Leave the details. Go.”

Graham hesitated. His gaze flicked—one more time—toward Charlie and the stays pattern, as if he couldn’t resist trying to make it a story.

Lauren’s voice stayed warm.

“Thanks, Graham,” she said. “We’ll take it from here.”

It was dismissal with manners. That was Lauren’s style: same authority, different temperature.

Graham left.

The door clicked shut.

The room didn’t exhale dramatically. It simply returned to its normal rhythm—as if the comment had been weather, and Mara had installed proper drainage.

Charlie finished the line he’d been drawing. He set the chalk down. Properly.

Then—only then—he looked up.

His eyes were bright, not with tears, but with the adrenaline of having *not* collapsed.

Sarah opened her mouth, clearly unable to help herself.

“Not bad,” she said. “You didn’t even flinch.”

Charlie’s gaze flicked to Mara—checking the rule.

Mara’s tone stayed flat.

“Colleague,” she reminded.

Sarah rolled her eyes. Adjusted.

“Not bad,” she repeated, different now. “You kept your hands.”

Charlie nodded once.

Lauren stepped closer, her voice quiet enough that it didn’t turn into applause.

“That’s the rung,” she said. “Not the comeback. The staying.”

Charlie swallowed. “It felt… stupid.”

Mara nodded. “Yes.”

Charlie blinked. “Yes?”

Mara pointed at the ledger.

“Stupid is common,” she said. “That’s why we train for it.”

Charlie looked down at the pattern as if it were suddenly the most honest thing in the room.

Lauren leaned on the table’s edge, not invading his space—just present.

“And did you notice something?” she asked, conversational.

Charlie frowned. “What?”

“You didn’t have to explain yourself,” Lauren said. “You didn’t have to persuade him. You didn’t have to win. You just named the work and kept doing it.”

Sarah made a small sound of reluctant agreement.

“That’s how you make them bored,” she said. “Bored men are safer.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to her, the faintest hint of approval.

“Accurate,” Mara said.

I went to the ledger, because the ledger was now where the room put truth.

Mara wrote, fast and sharp:

**EXPOSURE TRAINING — rung three completed:** stupid comment introduced; hands maintained; response factual; no retreat; task completed.

Charlie stared at the entry, then took the pen.

Under Mara’s line, he added, smaller:

**NOTES:** wanted to disappear. did not. named the work. kept drawing.

He underlined *kept drawing* once.

Mara slid the pattern piece back toward him.

“Again,” she said, as if nothing else mattered. “Museum wants more sizes.”

Charlie blinked—caught by the word, not the work.

“More sizes,” he repeated.

Lauren smiled, warm and practical.

“Welcome to being good,” she said. “It creates demand.”

Charlie picked up his chalk.

Not bravely.

Not theatrically.

Just… as if competence had become a habit, and habits could hold you up when people couldn’t.

If you’d like, I’ll write **Scene 19 — “The Numbers”** next as a Celeste POV scene where Mara lays out the revenue/throughput reality *without romance*, and Celeste’s MBA ambition appears as that precise, irritated constraint: *I can run circles around the class. I can’t run circles around tuition.*
