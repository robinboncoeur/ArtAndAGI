### Scene Twenty-Seven — “Adjustment” (Lauren POV)

The coffee pot was empty again.

Not “we forgot once.” Not “it slipped the mind.” Empty in the way it always seemed to be empty the moment the workroom got busy—like the caffeine evaporated out of the air and went straight into everyone’s hands.

Pauline’s message reached me via Celeste, delivered with the same crisp neutrality as a seam-stress note.

*Coffee is finished. She forget again.*

I glanced at the pot, then at the clock, then at the small, stupid truth that always sat underneath these moments: nobody *forgot*. People simply assumed someone else would do the unglamorous thing.

I didn’t mind doing unglamorous things.

I minded the assumption.

“Right,” I said aloud, to nobody, then turned toward the kitchen with a steadiness that made it clear this wasn’t a complaint. It was correction.

Wardrobe ran on corrections.

The kettle clicked on. Water began to hiss. I found the coffee tin, measured without ceremony, set the filter, poured.

I liked the simple tasks because they did not invite narrative. They invited competence. Nobody could turn refilling coffee into a personal journey unless they were desperate to be seen as the main character.

And if there was one thing Wardrobe did not reward, it was men trying to become the main character in a room of women who were busy.

The pot began to drip.

I stood there for a moment, listening to the steady, domestic sound and thinking about the message Celeste had sent right before the coffee note—shorter, stranger, more pointed.

*Pauline used “she.” Unthinking. He paused. Kept working. Asked for definitions. Pauline: “Yes. I mean she.” No theatre.*

I exhaled.

Not because I was shocked.

Because I could picture it perfectly.

I could picture Charl—always half a step from embarrassment, always hovering around the edges of rooms he didn’t think he deserved—going still like a startled deer. And I could picture Pauline, utterly uninterested in his self-consciousness, stepping over it the way you step over a dropped pin: you register it, you don’t make a song about it, you keep moving.

Pauline was old-world like that. Not sentimental. Not cruel. Simply anchored.

She didn’t “support” a change. She behaved as if the correct thing had become correct, and expected everyone else to catch up.

It was a kind of authority I respected.

The coffee finished. I poured the first cup, black, because it didn’t matter what I preferred—what mattered was not being the woman who left a whole team dry because she wanted to debate sugar.

I carried the pot back into the workroom.

It smelled like steam, linen, and that faint metallic bite of scissors. There were three conversations happening at once, none of them loud, all of them purposeful. Mara wasn’t in the room, but her influence was: the table layouts, the ledger open, the pins lined in their dish like they were meant to be accounted for.

Celeste was at the long table, posture straight, eyes moving between ledger and garment. She looked up once, saw me with the pot, and nodded.

Not gratitude.

Recognition: task complete.

Charl was there too, slightly hunched over the ledger, writing with an intensity that made his handwriting look like it was holding itself together by effort. He didn’t look up when I entered. He didn’t do the performative thing—*I should help you with that*—that men often do around women to announce their virtue.

He stayed with the work.

Good.

I set the coffee down and began pouring cups into the mismatched collection of mugs we’d accumulated like fossils. A mug with a cracked handle. A mug that said *World’s Best Mum* that nobody admitted belonged to anyone. A plain white one that belonged to Pauline and never moved.

Pauline herself appeared near the ironing board, steam rising like weather around her. She glanced at the pot, then at me.

She gave a small nod.

Acceptance granted. No further comment.

Celeste came over, took a cup, and leaned close enough that her voice could stay low.

“He asked,” she said. “Why wife. Why she. Definitions.”

“Of course he did,” I murmured.

Celeste’s mouth tightened faintly. Not irritation. Concentration.

“I didn’t reassure him,” she added, as if pre-empting the idea that she might have softened.

“I wouldn’t have expected you to,” I said. “Reassurance is for children. He asked for terms. That’s adult.”

Celeste’s gaze flicked to Charl.

“He’s… trying,” she said. It sounded like the closest thing she’d allow herself to say to *I’m relieved.*

“I know,” I said.

And I did.

I’d been watching him from the beginning—watching for the usual male pattern: the moment where being “helpful” turns into being owed. The moment where a man starts to think the room is grateful to him for existing in it.

Charl didn’t do that.

He had that flicker in him—the provider fantasy, the old script—but it wasn’t hardened into entitlement. Not yet. He was still teachable.

And women like Celeste didn’t keep teachable people around by accident.

I carried a cup across and set it down within Charl’s reach without stopping to make a moment of it.

He paused, looked at the cup, then glanced up at me.

“Thanks,” he said.

I nodded once.

Then—without looking around for approval, without glancing at Celeste as if to check whether he was allowed—I said the next thing I needed to say.

“Make sure she logs the waste figures against output,” I said, as if I were talking about any staff member.

Charl went still for half a second.

There it was again—the internal music changing key.

He blinked once. Then he nodded.

“Okay,” he said quietly. “I will.”

He didn’t correct me.

He didn’t ask *why would you say that* in front of others.

He simply accepted the instruction and moved to execute it, because that was the only currency he had here: doing the work correctly.

Celeste’s eyes snapped to me, sharp.

Not angry.

Assessing.

I held her gaze briefly, then looked away first—not submissive, simply unwilling to turn it into a power exchange. Celeste already had enough power in her life; she didn’t need me to perform deference. She needed me to make the room stable.

And stability sometimes meant moving faster than someone’s feelings.

Charl picked up his pencil again and wrote as if his hand needed the movement to keep his head from spiralling.

**WASTE — THREAD / OFFCUTS / REWORK HOURS**
**CORRELATE WITH OUTPUT — JAN TAB**

I watched him for another beat, then spoke again, still in that same practical tone.

“And if she’s not sure where to place it,” I added, “she asks. No guessing.”

Charl’s throat moved.

He nodded again.

“Right,” he said. “Definitions.”

The word came out like a promise he was making to himself as much as to us.

I turned back toward the ironing board, where Pauline was folding aprons with that crisp, brutal economy of motion.

“Pauline,” I said, “thank you for calling out the coffee.”

Pauline’s eyes met mine, unwavering.

“It is nothing,” she said. Which, coming from Pauline, meant: *It is the minimum standard. You will meet it.*

Then—almost idly, as if she were commenting on the weather—she said, “She works good today.”

She didn’t point. She didn’t look toward Charl.

She simply said it into the room like a fact that didn’t require permission.

Celeste’s posture shifted slightly, like someone hearing a gavel fall and deciding not to argue with the court.

Charl’s pencil paused.

He swallowed.

Then he kept writing.

No theatre.

I walked back to the long table, where Celeste had already resumed the ledger, and spoke low enough that only she could hear.

“This is how it should happen,” I said. “Not as a declaration. As a habit.”

Celeste’s eyes stayed on the page.

“And if he can’t handle it?” she asked, quiet, sharp. Not cruel. Protective of the system.

“Then he learns,” I said. “Or he leaves. But we don’t reorganise the room around him.”

Celeste’s lips pressed together.

“Good,” she said.

I watched her for a moment—the control, the burden, the way she held Wardrobe’s integrity like a blade she would not drop.

Then I added, gently but firmly, “Also: don’t let this become romance in his head.”

Celeste let out a small breath that might have been a laugh if she permitted herself softness.

“As if I would,” she said.

“I know,” I said. “But he might. That’s what the provider script does. It mistakes structure for affection.”

Celeste’s gaze flicked to Charl again.

He was bent over the ledger, shoulders drawn in, trying to make himself small enough to be safe while still doing the work well enough to be kept.

He had no idea how many women had quietly decided, without ever telling him, whether he was worth the effort.

That was the other truth about rooms like this: belonging isn’t requested. It’s assessed.

I walked to the shelf where we kept the policy binder—the boring documents that prevented chaos from turning into culture.

I pulled it down and opened to the latest insert. Mara’s handwriting. Celeste’s. Mine.

No titles. No flourishes. Just operational notes.

I took a pen and wrote a single line beneath the last entry:

**LANGUAGE: Use role-accurate pronouns in-work. No debate in-room. Questions handled one-on-one.**

Then I initialled it.

Not because it made it “official.”

Because it made it normal.

I put the binder back on the shelf.

When I turned, Charl looked up, eyes flicking briefly to the shelf, then away again. He’d seen me do something, but he wasn’t sure what. He didn’t ask in front of the room.

Good.

He was learning.

I walked back to the table and set my hand lightly on the ledger edge—present, steady, not affectionate.

“Anything you’re unsure about,” I said to him, “you ask Celeste. She’ll define it.”

Charl nodded.

Then he hesitated, just long enough to be visible.

“Lauren,” he said quietly.

“Yes.”

He looked up at me fully now, and there was something in his expression that was new: not panic, not bravado—humility with a spine.

“When you said ‘she’…” He paused. Swallowed. “That’s… what you want me to be?”

I didn’t soften. Softening would have turned it into permission theatre.

I answered in the only way that kept Wardrobe upright.

“It’s what matches your role here,” I said. “If you do the work like one of us, we speak to you like one of us.”

His eyes widened slightly.

“And if I—” He stopped, corrected himself mid-sentence like he’d been trained. “If she— if I don’t feel like I deserve it yet?”

I held his gaze.

“Then you keep working,” I said. “Deserving isn’t a feeling. It’s a record.”

He stared at me for a beat.

Then he nodded once.

“Okay,” he said, and the word sounded like acceptance instead of bracing. “Okay.”

I turned away before the moment could become intimate.

Because intimacy wasn’t the point.

Belonging was.

And belonging, here, looked like this:

A woman returning to her ledger.

Another woman folding aprons with merciless precision.

A person at the table—quiet, disciplined, learning—being spoken to in the grammar of the room, not the grammar of his past.

Wardrobe didn’t celebrate.

Wardrobe adjusted.

And the adjustment held.
