# Scene 5, Review

[Q]  
Hi Emily. We're looking at 2nd trial day in Wardrobe - this is currently Scene 5. At our last meeting, we finished with:

Of course — and that’s a smart editorial move, not a tedious one.

Your POV rule-of-thumb is now very clear and very workable:

* **Default lens:** Celeste (dominant figure; the story’s strategic intelligence and emotional gravity).
* **Occasional wideners:** Lauren or Mara (each with her own kind of authority), used intentionally.
* **Rare true omniscience:** only when it’s doing a specific job (bridging time, summarising a system shift, or giving the “network” view), and even then it should *feel* like it belongs to one of those women rather than a neutral narrator floating above everyone.

When you paste Scene 4, I’ll do three things in one pass (without bogging you down in theory):

1. **POV hygiene check:** confirm it stays anchored in Celeste’s perceptions and judgments (no sneaky head-hops into Charlie unless it’s through what Celeste can reasonably infer).
2. **Power emphasis:** make sure Celeste’s dominance is shown through *choices and governance* rather than exposition.
3. **Continuity hooks:** lightly seed the later beats (standards/process, the “odd safety” signal, early boundary literacy) without over-foreshadowing.

Drop it in whenever you’re ready, and we’ll tune it to your new POV emphasis while keeping the scenes you’ve already locked intact.

I've also attached an image of where **EVENTUALLY** the story will go, as Charlie tests garments as he works. EVENTUALLY.

[Emily]  
Got it. And that image is *exactly* the right “eventual destination” mood for Wardrobe: competence made quiet, sunlight turning work into ritual, the room itself feeling like a kind of promise.

Below is a **Scene 5 draft** (2nd trial day in Wardrobe), anchored hard in **Celeste’s POV**. I’ve written it so it *already* feels like a system is forming—without jumping too quickly to “Charlie is the full-time tester.” This is still the early stage: he’s useful, he’s hesitant, and the women are *deciding what that usefulness will become*.

## Scene 5 — Second Trial Day (Wardrobe)

Morning light does something honest to a room. It doesn’t flatter you. It reveals what you left out.

Wardrobe smelled like cloth and steam and yesterday’s impatience.

Mara was already at one of the old black machines—our “heritage” Singer that technically shouldn’t have been able to stitch through a double-folded waistband, and yet did it anyway, as if offended by the suggestion it couldn’t. The wheel turned with that low, steady confidence you only get from tools that have outlived their first owners.

On the worktable, a candle stood like a joke nobody laughed at—unlit, obviously, because we weren’t idiots. Beside it: two spools of thread in a red so bright it looked like a dare.

Lauren had the shelves open, hands on folded lengths of linen and wool like she was dealing cards. She wasn’t sorting by colour. She was sorting by *behaviour*. Fabric has personality, and Lauren had the gift of reading it at a glance.

I hung my tote on the hook by the door and slid my binder onto the central table with a soft thud.

Mara didn’t look up. “You’re early.”

“I’m punctual.”

Lauren’s mouth lifted slightly. “You’re controlling.”

“Also true.”

I opened the binder. Day Two: the docket, the checklists, the revision log. People liked to pretend Wardrobe was a dreamy annex of the world—soft women, soft fabric, soft light. But the work itself was relentless. If we didn’t run it like a lab, it would become a theatre of disasters.

Mara finally cut her stitch line, lifted the presser foot, and turned to me with her pin-cushion bracelet still strapped on like armour. “He’s coming?”

“He said he would.”

Lauren put a bolt down with care. “You wrote ‘said he would’ like you don’t trust him.”

I didn’t answer because I didn’t need to. Trust was something you gave after a pattern repeated. Until then, you observed.

Yesterday’s trial had been messy in the way first attempts usually were: not catastrophic, just… human. Too many assumptions. Too many people wanting to “help” at once. Too many voices.

I had gone home last night and written rules—not to be harsh, but to be kind. Structure is kindness. It saves people from guessing.

I flipped the binder open so the first page was visible to Mara and Lauren.

**WARDROBE TRIAL PROTOCOL (DRAFT v0.2)**

1. Only one voice gives instructions during fit. (Lead: Celeste.)
2. Only Mara pins. Only Lauren records.
3. Tester does not apologise. Tester reports sensations plainly.
4. Any discomfort above “mild” stops the trial immediately. No debate.
5. Language stays technical. If someone makes it personal, they leave.

Lauren read it, then looked at me as if I’d just adopted a stray dog and named it “Boundaries.”

Mara’s expression stayed flat, but her eyes softened by half a millimetre. With Mara, that was a sonnet.

“Good,” she said. “Now we can actually work.”

We heard him before we saw him: the front bell, then the pause, as if he had to convince his own hand to open the door fully.

Charlie stepped into the threshold and froze for a beat, like he expected the room to judge him on sight.

Which—of course it did. That’s what rooms do.

He’d dressed clean today. Not stylish. Not trying. Just… prepared. Dark jeans, plain shirt. Hair still damp at the edges. He held a small canvas bag—tools, maybe. Or talismans.

His gaze went straight to the central table with the binder, the pinned pieces, the half-assembled bodice that looked innocent until you remembered what bodices were designed to do: dictate the body’s shape in public.

“Morning,” he said.

Mara didn’t do greetings. She did *results*.

Lauren, because she was nicer than she pretended, gave him a small nod. “Morning, Charlie.”

I watched him clock the room: the machine, the thread, the shelves, the measuring tape draped like a ribbon over a chair. He looked like someone entering a workshop where all the tools were familiar but the purpose had changed.

He still hadn’t moved his feet.

I said, gently, “Come in. Door can close.”

He did, and the click of the latch sounded final in a way it shouldn’t have.

He set his bag down by his shoes as if he didn’t want it on the worktable. Respectful. Good sign.

Mara wiped her hands on her apron. “You’re on time.”

He seemed relieved by the simplicity of that statement. “Yeah. I—um. I didn’t want to be late.”

Lauren leaned an elbow onto the shelf edge. “You don’t want to be late, or you don’t want to be a problem?”

His mouth opened, then shut again.

I stepped in before Lauren could press, because Lauren always pressed. “Today is simpler. We trial one piece. We log what happens. We adjust. No performance.”

He glanced at me like he was checking whether “no performance” was a promise or a trap.

I tapped the binder. “And we have a protocol now.”

He looked at the list, and his shoulders dropped slightly—like rules were a relief, not a restriction.

“Okay,” he said. “What do you need me to do?”

That was the first real sentence he’d offered since I met him: direct, useful, unembellished.

Mara walked to the mannequin and lifted the half-finished outer garment we’d pinned yesterday. It was an eighteenth-century-inspired over-gown in a stormy blue—beautiful in that calm, serious way that made silly people call it “plain.” It wasn’t plain. It was disciplined.

She held it up, assessed the seams, then looked at him.

“You understand this is fit-testing,” she said.

“Yes.”

“And you understand this will feel… different.”

He swallowed. I watched the swallow like it was data.

“Yes.”

He didn’t add the usual male disclaimer—*I’m not like that*—because he wasn’t stupid. Or because he was. I couldn’t tell yet.

Mara gestured to the curtained area. “Undershirt stays. Jeans off. You’ll put these on.”

Lauren handed him a folded bundle without ceremony: simple trial petticoat and a light wrap, cut for speed rather than elegance.

He took it like it weighed more than it did.

His eyes flicked to me again.

Here it was: the moment he’d been rehearsing in his head, the small edge of humiliation he expected the world to demand.

I didn’t give it to him.

I said, matter-of-fact, “You’re here as an engineer. Engineers don’t blush at prototypes.”

He made a sound that might have been a laugh if he’d trusted his own mouth.

He disappeared behind the curtain.

We didn’t speak while he changed. Not because it was taboo. Because we were professionals, and because silence is one of the women’s oldest forms of power. Silence says: *This is normal. You’re the only one making it dramatic.*

Lauren, quietly, slid her notebook open. Mara adjusted the pins on her wrist like she was settling into a fight.

I turned a page in the binder and waited.

After a minute, the curtain shifted again.

Charlie stepped out.

He looked… wrong, in the way any person looks wrong when their clothing has been swapped for something they haven’t learned to inhabit. The petticoat was plain and functional, but it still changed the geometry of him. His hips read differently. His legs moved with a fraction more caution, as if space had new rules.

He kept his hands at his sides like he’d been told not to touch anything expensive.

He wasn’t laughing. He wasn’t making a joke. He was doing the one thing that made me take him seriously:

He was trying.

Mara didn’t comment on his body. Mara commented on fabric.

She stepped forward, lifted the over-gown, and draped it over him with a brisk competence that made “gender” feel like an irrelevant distraction.

“Arms,” she said.

He lifted them.

The sleeves hung slightly long. The shoulder seam pulled. The neckline sat too high, as if the garment was suspicious of the throat.

Mara circled him, pinning fast. “Stand like you’re standing.”

“I am standing.”

“No,” she said, and there was no cruelty in it—just accuracy. “You’re standing like you’re waiting to be corrected.”

His cheeks went pink.

I watched his eyes—how they kept darting to my face for verdict.

I gave him none. Not yet.

I said, “Describe sensations. Don’t apologise.”

He nodded. “Okay.”

Mara tugged the bodice line at his ribs. “How’s that?”

He hesitated, then chose honesty. “Tight.”

“How tight,” I prompted. “Mild. Medium. Stop.”

He considered. “Medium.”

Mara’s hands paused. “Breathable medium, or ‘I can’t think’ medium?”

He breathed in, slowly, testing. “Breathable.”

“Good.” Mara adjusted the pin line anyway, because Mara didn’t accept “good enough” when “better” was available.

Lauren recorded every word, not looking up. “Neckline: too high. Rib pressure: medium breathable. Sleeve length: long.”

I watched Charlie’s posture shift, imperceptibly, as he realised this wasn’t an audition for dignity. This was an audit of engineering.

His breathing slowed.

His eyes steadied.

He began to inhabit the room instead of merely surviving it.

Mara stepped back. “Walk.”

He blinked. “Just… walk?”

“Don’t overthink it,” Lauren said without looking up. “That’s my job.”

He took a careful step, then another. The over-gown swayed, the skirt weight moving like a bell. He nearly tripped on the hem, caught himself, and froze—expecting laughter.

None came.

I said, “Again. Slower. Notice what catches.”

He did.

On the second pass, he moved with more authority—still awkward, but less apologetic. The hem snagged at his shin. The bodice tugged at the shoulder seam on the forward swing of his arms.

He stopped and looked at Mara as if she’d asked him to translate a language he only half knew.

“It… pulls here,” he said, and indicated his shoulder with two fingers, careful not to paw at the garment.

Mara’s eyes sharpened. “Good. That’s useful.”

You could almost see his brain light up at the word *useful*.

Lauren looked up at last, gaze sliding over him the way you’d assess a chair you were about to buy—no romance, no cruelty, just evaluation. “You’re not collapsing into yourself today.”

His face went blank. “Was I… yesterday?”

“Yes,” she said cheerfully. “Like an overcooked noodle.”

He didn’t know how to respond to that.

I rescued him—not because he needed rescuing, but because I needed momentum.

“Lauren,” I said, “be kind in a way he can use.”

Lauren gave me an exaggerated innocent look. “I am being kind. I’m telling him the truth.”

“I know.” I kept my tone soft, but it was still an instruction. “Try it in sentences that don’t make him imagine soup.”

Mara made a short sound that might’ve been amusement.

Charlie’s mouth twitched. There: a tiny fissure in his tension.

I moved closer, stopping just within his peripheral vision. “You’re doing fine,” I told him, because it was true. “But don’t look to me for permission. You’re here to report. We’ll decide.”

He inhaled like he’d been holding his breath for a week.

“Okay,” he said again. But this time it didn’t sound like surrender.

It sounded like acceptance of a process.

Mara pinned the shoulder seam, then stepped back and tilted her head. “This line can be cleaner.”

Lauren scribbled. “Shoulder seam: revise angle. Hem: lift a centimetre, maybe two.”

I turned a page in the binder. “Charlie. Any itching? Any heat? Any sharpness?”

He shook his head. “No. Just… different.”

“That’s not a category,” Lauren said, and I heard the smile in her voice.

He tried again. “It’s… heavier than what I’m used to. And I can feel it when it moves. Like it wants me to move a certain way.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to mine: *He’s observant.*

I nodded once. *Yes. He is.*

“Good,” I said. “That’s exactly the kind of note that matters.”

He looked down at the skirt like it might suddenly explain itself.

Then, so quietly it almost didn’t count, he said, “Is it… weird that it doesn’t feel… awful?”

It wasn’t a confession. It was a question asked by someone who’d been told his whole life what he was supposed to find disgusting.

Lauren’s pen stopped.

Mara’s hands stilled.

I answered carefully, because this was the first moment of real psychological material—and I wasn’t going to handle it like a bully or a priest.

“It’s not weird,” I said. “It’s information.”

He looked up at me, startled by how neutral I was being.

I held his gaze. “Your job here isn’t to prove anything about yourself. Your job is to tell us what the garment does. That’s it.”

He nodded, almost grateful.

Mara stepped in and began unpinning with quick, deft fingers. “Back behind the curtain. Change out.”

He obeyed without argument.

When he was gone, Lauren exhaled and leaned her hip against the table. “He’s not a clown.”

“No,” I said. “He’s not.”

Mara gathered the garment in her arms like it was a patient. “He’s a good instrument. He tells the truth.”

Lauren raised an eyebrow. “And you like that.”

I didn’t bother denying it. “I like anything that behaves predictably.”

Mara set the garment on the table and began marking chalk lines. “We keep him.”

Lauren’s grin sharpened. “Already decided, have you?”

Mara didn’t look up. “He’s useful. And he’s teachable.”

I closed the binder gently. “We don’t ‘keep’ people,” I said, because words mattered.

Mara’s chalk paused.

I added, softer, “But yes. We build a process around him. If he keeps showing up like this.”

Lauren’s eyes went bright with mischief. “Look at you, building a little system.”

I gave her a look. “Look at you, pretending you’re not pleased.”

The curtain shifted again. Charlie stepped out, changed back, hair more rumpled than before.

He looked at us like he expected a verdict.

I gave him one—but not the one he anticipated.

“You did your job,” I said. “Come back tomorrow at the same time. Eat beforehand. Bring water.”

He blinked. “That’s… it?”

“That’s it,” I said. “And Charlie?”

“Yes?”

“Don’t narrate this to anyone who wants it to be a joke. If someone asks, you say: ‘Wardrobe trial. Technical.’ And you stop talking.”

He nodded quickly, as if relieved to have a script.

Lauren waved her pen at him like a wand. “And if you ever catch yourself apologising, swallow it. We don’t need apologies. We need data.”

He actually smiled then—small, startled, but real.

“Okay,” he said.

And for the first time, it sounded like he meant: *I can do this.*

He picked up his bag, paused at the door, and glanced back once—at the shelves, the machine, the light.

As if the room had changed shape.

As if he already knew he’d be returning.

When the door shut, Mara returned to the machine. The wheel turned again, steady as a heartbeat.

Lauren’s gaze drifted to me. “So,” she said lightly. “Second trial day. And no disasters.”

I looked down at the binder, at the checklist, at the chalk lines Mara had already begun to revise.

“No disasters,” I agreed.

Then, because I am me, and because I didn’t trust easy wins, I added, “Yet.”

### What this scene quietly sets up (without forcing it)

* **Process over spectacle:** everyone treats “trial wear” like engineering, not humiliation. That’s the seed of the later “Charlie becomes the reliable tester” evolution.
* **Your “women’s competence network” shows through action:** Mara = craft authority; Lauren = social/linguistic authority; Celeste = governance.
* **Early boundary literacy:** the protocol plus “don’t narrate it to jokers” is Celeste teaching him how to survive the social fallout *without her rescuing him*.
* **A tiny hinge moment:** “it doesn’t feel awful” is introduced as *information*, not identity. That keeps it tasteful and believable.

If you want, next we can do **one of two directions** for Scene 6 (without you having to decide right now):

1. **A complication:** someone outside Wardrobe tries to turn the trial into gossip, and Celeste shuts it down with surgical calm.
2. **A deepening:** Charlie begins offering surprisingly sharp sensory notes, and Mara starts relying on him—not emotionally, *professionally*—which is how the “tester role” becomes inevitable.

And yes: that image you attached? The “sunbeams + machine + folded linen + blue seriousness” vibe is now baked into Wardrobe as an identity.
