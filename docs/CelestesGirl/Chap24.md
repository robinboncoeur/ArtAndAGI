# Scene 24

### Scene 25 — *Keep It Clean* (Celeste POV)

At home, the quiet had a different texture.

Wardrobe’s silence was fluorescent—flat, interrogative, full of edges. Home silence had softness to it, as if the air had been warmed by the fact that nobody was currently judging your competence.

Which was, of course, exactly why it was dangerous.

I dropped my keys into the bowl by the door and heard the small clink like punctuation. Sharl’s shoes were already lined up neatly beside the skirting board—parallel, facing outward, prepared for the next day as if time itself respected organisation.

He was in the kitchen, sleeves pushed up, rinsing something at the sink. Not making noise. Not announcing his presence. Just… doing the boring thing that made the next boring thing easier.

The smell of dish soap, warm water, and coffee grounds hit me like a memory I hadn’t lived yet.

“I’m home,” I said.

He turned, towel in hand, and smiled—small, restrained, like he wasn’t sure whether smiles were a resource he was allowed to spend freely.

“Hey,” he said. “How’d it go?”

I could have answered with the practical summary. Quote sent. Assumptions logged. Deposit schedule set. Mara had accidentally sealed “Sharl” into the shop’s language and the universe had not collapsed.

Instead, what rose up first was the truth underneath all of it:

It went the way things went when he was there. Steadier. Cleaner. Easier.

And the sentence that tried to leave my mouth was the one that turned wives into ghosts.

*I don’t know what I’d do without you.*

It sat on the tip of my tongue, sweet and grateful and—if I let it land—dangerous as a locked door. Because that sentence didn’t just thank him. It wrote a story around him. It made his support feel like a requirement. It made the room feel like it belonged to his labour.

And once you said it enough times, you stopped noticing how much labour there actually was.

I swallowed it back.

I watched him set the plate in the rack with the kind of care that looked like nothing until you tried to live without it.

He didn’t look up while he worked, which meant he wasn’t performing. He was simply being himself.

Which made it harder.

“Good,” I said instead, and the word sounded bland even to me. I hated how bland it sounded. I hated how easily sincerity got confused with debt.

Sharl nodded once, accepting the blandness as if it were normal.

That was another thing. He didn’t demand emotional payment. He didn’t fish for validation. He didn’t do the little resentful dances people did when they wanted you to notice their sacrifice.

He was so easy to lean on that I could feel myself doing it.

I went into my room—*my* room; the fact still mattered—and dumped my bag on the bed. Papers. Notes. A printout with pen marks. The kind of debris that looked messy but was actually the record of thinking.

When I came back out, he’d put the kettle on.

Not because he wanted tea. Because it was what people did in houses where pressure had happened, and someone needed to come down from it.

“Do you want—” he began.

“No,” I said quickly, then softened it because I wasn’t trying to snap at him. “No tea. But… thank you.”

He nodded as if “thank you” were enough and didn’t require commentary.

I moved to the kitchen bench, leaned my hands on the laminate, and stared at the neat little universe he’d arranged without ever making it feel like his territory. The sponge squeezed out. The dishcloth folded. The bin not overflowing.

This was what wives did, historically: not because they were born to it, but because someone had to. Because leaving friction lying around was expensive, and women were trained—explicitly or not—to pay that expense with their own time.

Sharl was paying it now.

Not as a performance. As instinct. As the easiest way to be useful.

And I could feel his old provider fantasy behind it like a shadow: *If I make her life easier, I’ll be worth keeping.*

Even if he didn’t phrase it that way. Even if he didn’t understand it that way.

I needed to interrupt it before it calcified.

Not because I didn’t want his help.

Because I did.

But help that couldn’t be named became labour that couldn’t be valued. And labour that couldn’t be valued became expectation. And expectation became entitlement in the person who benefited.

I wouldn’t do that. I refused.

I looked at him.

He was at the sink again, not because the sink needed him, but because his body didn’t know what to do with waiting. He kept moving to keep the room stable.

“Sharl,” I said.

He turned, attentive.

I held his gaze and forced myself not to wrap it in softness that would make it easier to ignore later.

“This works,” I said, and I gestured between us—house, arrangement, day, everything. “It works because we keep it clean.”

His eyebrows lifted slightly, a question without words.

I felt the cowardly part of me want to stop there. *Good job. Boundary implied. Go sit down.*

No. That wasn’t clean. That was avoidance dressed as wisdom.

“I’m going to talk to you tonight,” I said.

He stilled. Not alarmed. Just… present. Ready.

“Okay,” he said quietly.

I nodded once, because the commitment mattered more than whatever tone I put around it.

“Not a big thing,” I added, because I didn’t want him spiralling. “Just… clarity. Terms. The same way we do it at Wardrobe.”

A flicker crossed his face—relief, actually. Like the mention of terms and process had given him a handrail.

“Right,” he said. “Okay.”

I exhaled.

The hardest part, I realised, wasn’t telling him to stop doing things for me.

The hardest part was admitting that I liked the support. That I was beginning to depend on it in the practical way that mattered. That if I didn’t name it now, I’d wake up in six months with a domestic system that ran on his invisible labour and a mind that had started treating that labour like weather.

That was how women got caught.

I watched him for a second longer, then picked up my papers and walked toward the table I used for study.

“I need an hour,” I said, and I didn’t apologise. “In session.”

He nodded immediately. “Yep. I’ll be quiet.”

He reached into the drawer and pulled out the small card we’d made—white card stock, black marker:

**IN SESSION**

He placed it on the bench where it would be visible, like a signal flag. No drama. No wounded expression. No bargaining.

Just compliance with a system that protected my future.

I sat down, opened my notes, and the words on the page steadied me.

Behind me, I heard him move lightly—one cupboard, one drawer, one soft click. The domestic machine continuing. The wife-work continuing.

But now it had a name.

Now it had a boundary approaching.

And the simple fact of that made the room feel cleaner, even before I said the rest.

I looked down at my notes, pen poised, and let my mind make a promise that wasn’t sentimental and therefore had a chance of being true:

Tonight, I would keep it clean.

Not by refusing care.

By naming it.

By pricing it.

By refusing to let it become currency.

Because I could already feel the old story trying to write itself.

And I was not going to let it.
