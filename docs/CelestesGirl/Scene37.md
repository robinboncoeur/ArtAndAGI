# Scene 37




## From 25.01.05

## Scene — “The Call” / “The Referral” (Lauren POV)

Celeste didn’t ring me like a girl with gossip.

She rang me like a manager reporting a safety breach.

“Lauren,” she said, voice controlled, “Charli is safe. But I found something in the bathroom cabinet. Capsules. He’s been taking them for three months. He says it’s because he’s scared of masculinising changes.”

There was a second—one clean second—where my brain refused to accept the sentence.

Capsules. Three months. In secret.

My hand tightened around the phone until my knuckles hurt.

“How safe?” I asked.

“Safe right now,” Celeste said. “He stopped. I’ve got them. He didn’t want to tell you. I’m telling you.”

I closed my eyes.

Celeste’s voice didn’t wobble. It didn’t apologise for consequence. It simply *held the line.*

And in that instant I understood something I’d only half understood before: Celeste wasn’t a romantic interest in Charli’s life. She was a standard-bearer. A girl who treated ethics like physics.

“Okay,” I said, because okay was what you said when you needed to keep breathing. “I’m coming.”

“Good,” Celeste replied. “We need a plan. Not blame.”

Not blame.

My chest tightened with gratitude I didn’t quite have words for.

“I’ll be there tonight,” I said.

“Drive safe,” she said, and hung up as if the call were a transaction: information delivered, action set.

I stood there in my kitchen and stared at nothing.

A memory rose — Charli at four years old, cheeks sticky with jam, trying to tie his shoelaces with a concentration that looked like prayer. He’d always been like that: careful, earnest, determined to be useful.

Useful was his religion.

And now useful had nearly killed him.

I picked up my keys.

---

Winter down there wasn’t like winter in stories.

It didn’t feel cinematic. It felt like wind that found your bones. The kind of cold that made you realise how much you depended on walls.

By the time I pulled up outside Celeste’s place, the sky was already that dull metallic grey that arrives early and stays late. The air stung. My breath fogged.

Celeste opened the door before I could knock.

She was composed, hair clipped back, face bare, eyes clear. Not a girl waiting to be judged. A young woman with her hands on the wheel.

“Come in,” she said quietly.

I stepped inside and the warmth hit my face. Not cosy-warm. Functional warm. Heater on, floor clear, shoes lined up like a small act of control against weather and chaos.

Charli was at the kitchen table.

He looked up when he saw me.

The look on his face made my heart squeeze so hard I nearly lost my breath.

Not guilty in the way a child looks guilty when they’ve broken a rule.

Guilty in the way a good person looks when they’ve been terrified and stupid and are now ashamed of the terror itself.

“Mum,” he said, small.

I wanted to go to him immediately — to wrap him up, to scold him, to do all the mother things at once.

I didn’t.

Charli didn’t respond well to spectacle. Comfort that was too loud turned into debt in his head. He would start managing *my* feelings instead of dealing with his own crisis.

So I walked to the table. I sat down. I put my keys next to my bag.

Then I looked at him directly.

“Tell me,” I said.

Charli’s eyes dropped.

Celeste didn’t hover. She didn’t insert herself. She stayed standing by the bench like a witness and a firewall.

“It was because of… changes,” Charli said, voice rough. “The male stuff. I didn’t want it.”

“How long?” I asked.

“Three months.”

My stomach dropped and then steadied into anger’s cold, practical sister: resolve.

“Where did you get them?” I asked.

Charli hesitated, then whispered, “Online.”

I closed my eyes for a beat.

Online.

My son had turned his body into a DIY project because he was scared and didn’t believe he was allowed to ask for help.

Celeste’s voice cut in, calm and uncompromising.

“He was trying to protect his ability to blend in costumes,” she said. “That’s how he framed it.”

I looked at Charli.

“And is that how it feels?” I asked him. “Just… blending?”

He swallowed.

“It’s… the only way I can explain it,” he said, and his voice cracked on the last word. “I just— when it starts happening, it feels like I’m being pushed into a shape I don’t want. Like it’s ruining everything.”

Celeste set a small bottle on the table.

Not a slam. An exhibit.

“I took these,” she said. “I’m not leaving them accessible. Not to punish you. To keep you safe.”

I nodded once, grateful.

Then I turned back to my son and let the steel into my voice — not cruelty, not humiliation. Consequence.

“Charli,” I said, “you are never taking secret medicine again.”

His eyes squeezed shut.

“I know,” he whispered.

“No,” I said. “You *know* now because you got caught. I need you to know because you understand. Because you choose it.”

He looked up then, eyes wet.

“I didn’t want to be difficult,” he said.

That sentence hit me harder than the capsules.

Because it was the sentence underneath everything.

I felt my throat tighten. I kept my voice steady.

“You are not difficult for needing care,” I said. “Do you understand me?”

He nodded, barely.

Celeste spoke again, still calm, still firm.

“I want him seen by a doctor,” she said. “Properly. Psychiatrist first. Then endocrinology if appropriate. Supervised. Documented.”

I looked at her and felt something close to relief.

This was what competence looked like: not panic, not pity, not ideology.

A plan.

“Yes,” I said. “We do it properly.”

Charli’s shoulders sagged as if he’d been holding his body up with willpower alone.

“I’m scared,” he admitted.

I let myself soften a fraction.

“I know,” I said. “And we’re still doing it properly.”

---

The psychiatrist’s waiting room the next day smelled like disinfectant and cheap tea. I sat with my coat folded on my lap like armour.

Charli sat beside me, very still.

His hair was tied back, neat. His face looked cared for in that plain, functional way — not glamour, not performance. Maintenance.

And that, perversely, made me angry again, because it proved how much he *could* do when he believed he was allowed.

The psychiatrist was calm and clean and unshowy. He spoke to Charli first, which I appreciated. He asked questions that weren’t traps, asked them twice in different ways, letting the truth settle into the room like sediment.

Charli tried, at first, to keep it in the language he knew.

“Blending,” he said. “Costumes. Not standing out.”

The psychiatrist nodded.

“And what happens inside you when masculinising changes show up?” he asked.

Charli stared at his hands.

“I feel… horrified,” he said, and the word came out like it hurt. “Like I’m being forced.”

“And when you’re more androgynous?” the psychiatrist asked.

Charli’s shoulders lowered slightly.

“I can breathe,” he said.

The psychiatrist let a silence sit, then said something that landed like a stamp without being a shove.

“Charli, what you’re describing is consistent with gender dysphoria,” he said.

Charli’s head snapped up.

“But I’m not—” he began, and stopped, trapped by the weight of labels.

The psychiatrist didn’t force a label onto him.

“I’m not asking you to define identity today,” he said gently. “I’m describing a pattern of distress. The distress matters. The risk you took matters. We treat the distress, and we keep you safe while you figure out the rest.”

I felt my chest tighten — grief, relief, fear, and something like vindication all tangled together.

Because the truth was: I’d known something was off for years.

Not in a dramatic way. In a mother way. In that quiet sense that your child is fighting a battle they don’t have words for.

I’d thought it was depression. Anxiety. The cruelty of adolescence.

Maybe it had been all of that.

But this — this was clearer. This was a *shape*.

And suddenly the last three months made a terrifying kind of sense: the costumes, the blending, the relief in being able to disappear into a silhouette that didn’t scream “boy.” The panic at puberty’s momentum.

The psychiatrist printed a referral and slid it across the desk.

“Endocrinology,” he said. “With the diagnosis documented. So you don’t have to improvise in the dark.”

I took the paper and looked at it the way I looked at a school report: not as judgement, but as information that dictated next steps.

Charli stared at it like it might bite.

I put my hand flat on the desk, near it — not touching him, not forcing comfort, just *present.*

“We’re doing this properly,” I said.

He nodded, the smallest motion.

---

The endocrinologist was a woman with the kind of competence I recognised instantly — crisp, unperformative, direct without being cold.

She addressed Charli first. She made him the centre of his own care. She asked about goals in practical language: what he feared, what he hoped for, what he could tolerate, what he couldn’t.

Then she looked at me.

“Lauren,” she said, “your role is support and safety. Not control. We want reversible, monitored decisions whenever possible.”

I nodded.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s what I want.”

The endocrinologist discussed options carefully, with clear boundaries: what could be considered, what needed monitoring, what was not a DIY project, what could be paused or reversed if Charli needed to reassess. She did not sell a fantasy. She offered a framework.

Charli listened like someone starving for structure.

“So I don’t have to decide… everything at once?” he asked.

“No,” she said. “You decide what you need right now to reduce distress and stay safe. We monitor. We reassess. You keep agency.”

I watched my son’s shoulders lower.

Not dramatically. Not like a miracle.

Like a person whose nervous system had finally been told it wasn’t alone.

When we left, Charli walked a little more evenly. His eyes were less hunted.

In the car, I didn’t start the engine right away. I sat with my hands on the wheel and let the reality settle.

My son had dysphoria.

My son had tried to treat it alone because he didn’t think he deserved supervised help.

And now — now he had a plan with adults around him who understood risk and consent and monitoring.

I turned to him.

“You’re not in trouble for being afraid,” I said.

He swallowed hard. “It felt like it would ruin everything.”

I shook my head slowly.

“It doesn’t ruin everything,” I said. “It tells us what we have to take seriously.”

His eyes shone. He looked away quickly.

“And,” I added, steel returning, “you are never doing secret medicine again.”

He nodded. “I won’t.”

I held the wheel tighter.

“Also,” I said, “you are not allowed to call yourself difficult for needing care.”

He made a small sound, half laugh, half heartbreak. “Mum…”

“I’m not raising a martyr,” I said. “I’m raising a person who asks for help before he risks his life.”

Charli stared out the window for a moment, then nodded again.

“Okay,” he whispered.

I started the car.

As we pulled away, my mind — inevitably — flicked to Celeste.

To the way she’d handled the discovery with consequence instead of shame. To the way she’d pulled me in without drama and then stepped back, letting me be his mother while still holding standards like a scaffold.

I didn’t know what their relationship would become.

But I knew one thing with startling clarity:

My son was safer with women who treated care as a system, not as a mood.

And if he was going to get through this — not by toughening up into masculinity, but by finding a shape he could live in — then the only acceptable path was the one we’d finally chosen:

Supervised. Documented. Reversible where possible.

No secrets.

No heroics.

Just standards.

---

If you want, the next beat can be **Lauren visiting Wardrobe** after the medical plan is set — seeing the winter fabrics, the scaling, the way Charli moves in the space now — and having a private moment with Celeste that’s *not* gushy, but deeply consequential: Lauren thanking her for the intervention, and Celeste making her own terms clear (“no secrecy in this house; no health risks for a silhouette; we log appointments”).


<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">












Got you. We keep **Lauren POV** (it *is* the right handover), and we fix the pronouns in a way that *tracks Lauren’s heart* rather than pretending she’s already perfectly settled.

So:

* **Spoken to Celeste / in the “safety breach” frame:** Lauren mirrors Celeste’s language—**Charli / she**.
* **In Lauren’s memory-muscle (childhood, “son” reflex):** a few deliberate **he/him** slips appear *in Lauren’s internal narration only*, then get corrected by her own mind. Not sloppy—*audited in real time*.
* As the scene progresses and the medical system validates the pattern, Lauren’s internal grammar **stabilises toward “she.”**
* We also remove “psychiatrist first” as a hard rule (too jurisdictionally specific), and we **do not** add any medication detail or pathway specifics beyond “supervised specialist referral,” because we’re not writing a guide.

Here’s a revised, clean version.

## Scene 37 — “The Call” / “The Referral” (Lauren POV)

Celeste didn’t ring me like a girl with gossip.

She rang me like a manager reporting a safety breach.

“Lauren,” she said, voice controlled, “Charli is safe. But I found something in the bathroom cabinet. Capsules. She’s been taking them for three months. She says it’s because she’s scared of masculinising changes.”

There was a second—one clean second—where my brain refused to accept the sentence.

Capsules. Three months. In secret.

My hand tightened around the phone until my knuckles hurt.

“How safe?” I asked.

“Safe right now,” Celeste said. “She stopped. I’ve got them. She didn’t want to tell you. I’m telling you.”

I closed my eyes.

Celeste’s voice didn’t wobble. It didn’t apologise for consequence. It simply held the line.

And in that instant I understood something I’d only half understood before: Celeste wasn’t a romantic interest drifting through Charli’s life. She was a standard-bearer. A young woman who treated ethics like physics.

“Okay,” I said, because okay was what you said when you needed to keep breathing. “I’m coming.”

“Good,” Celeste replied. “We need a plan. Not blame.”

Not blame.

My chest tightened with gratitude I didn’t quite have words for.

“I’ll be there tonight,” I said.

“Drive safe,” she said, and hung up as if the call were a transaction: information delivered, action set.

I stood in my kitchen and stared at nothing.

A memory rose—Charli at four years old, cheeks sticky with jam, trying to tie shoelaces with a concentration that looked like prayer. He’d always been like that: careful, earnest, determined to be useful.

Useful was his religion.

And now useful had nearly killed—

No. Not *useful*. Not the trait. The *fear*. The doing-things-alone. The secrecy. The attempt to solve a body with willpower and internet packaging.

I picked up my keys.

Winter down there wasn’t like winter in stories.

It didn’t feel cinematic. It felt like wind that found your bones. The kind of cold that made you realise how much you depended on walls.

By the time I pulled up outside Celeste’s place, the sky was already that dull metallic grey that arrives early and stays late. The air stung. My breath fogged.

I stepped inside and warmth hit my face. Not cosy-warm. Functional warm. Heater on, floor clear, shoes lined up like a small act of control against weather and chaos.

Charli was at the kitchen table.

She looked up when she saw me.

The look on her face made my heart squeeze so hard I nearly lost my breath.

Not guilty in the way a child looks guilty when they’ve broken a rule.

Guilty in the way a good person looks when she’s been terrified and reckless and is now ashamed of the terror itself.

“Mum,” she said, small.

I wanted to go to her immediately—to wrap her up, to scold her, to do all the mother things at once.

I didn’t.

Charli didn’t respond well to spectacle. Comfort that was too loud turned into debt in her head. She would start managing *my* feelings instead of dealing with her own crisis.

So I walked to the table. I sat down. I put my keys next to my bag.

Charli hesitated, then whispered, “Online.”

My child had turned her body into a DIY project because she was scared and didn’t believe she was allowed to ask for help.

Celeste spoke, calm and uncompromising.

“She framed it as protecting her ability to blend in costume,” she said. “That’s the language she had for it.”

Not a slam. An exhibit.

“I took these,” she said. “I’m not leaving them accessible. Not to punish you. To keep you safe.”

I nodded once, grateful.

Then I turned back to Charli and let steel into my voice—not cruelty, not humiliation. Consequence.

“Charli,” I said, “you are never taking secret medicine again.”

Her eyes squeezed shut.

“I know,” she whispered.

“No,” I said. “You know now because you got caught. I need you to know because you understand. Because you choose it.”

She looked up then, eyes wet.

“I didn’t want to be difficult,” she said.

That sentence hit me harder than the capsules.

Because it was the sentence underneath everything.

I felt my throat tighten. I kept my voice steady.

“You are not difficult for needing care,” I said. “Do you understand me?”

She nodded, barely.

Celeste spoke again, still calm, still firm.

“I want her seen by a doctor,” she said. “Properly. Supervised. Documented. Specialist referral if needed. No improvising.”

I looked at her and felt something close to relief.

This was what competence looked like: not panic, not pity, not ideology.

A plan.

“Yes,” I said. “We do it properly.”

Charli’s shoulders sagged as if she’d been holding herself up with willpower alone.

“I’m scared,” she admitted.

I let myself soften a fraction.

“I know,” I said. “And we’re still doing it properly.”

The waiting room the next day smelled like disinfectant and cheap tea. I sat with my coat folded on my lap like armour.

Charli sat beside me, very still.

Her hair was tied back, neat. Her face looked cared for in that plain, functional way—maintenance, not performance.

“And what happens inside you when masculinising changes show up?” she asked.

Charli stared at her hands.

“I feel… horrified,” she said, and the word came out like it hurt. “Like I’m being forced.”

“And when your body reads more androgynous?” the clinician asked.

Charli’s shoulders lowered slightly.

“I can breathe,” she said.

The clinician let silence sit, then said something that landed like a stamp without being a shove.

“Charli, what you’re describing is consistent with gender dysphoria,” she said.

My chest tightened—grief, relief, fear, and something like vindication tangled together.

Because the truth was: I’d known something was off for years.

Not in a dramatic way. In a mother way. In that quiet sense that your child is fighting a battle she doesn’t have words for.

I’d thought it was depression. Anxiety. The cruelty of adolescence.

Maybe it had been all of that.

But this—this was clearer. This was a *shape*.

The clinician printed a referral and slid it across the desk.

“A specialist,” she said. “With the pattern documented. So you don’t have to improvise in the dark.”

I took the paper and looked at it the way I looked at a school report: not judgement—information that dictated next steps.

Charli stared at it like it might bite.

I put my hand flat on the desk near it—not touching her, not forcing comfort. Just present.

“We’re doing this properly,” I said.

She nodded, the smallest motion.

---

The specialist appointment was a week later. A woman with crisp competence—direct without being cold—met Charli’s eyes first and kept her there.

She asked about goals in plain language: what Charli feared, what she hoped for, what she could tolerate, what she couldn’t.

Then she looked at me.

“Lauren,” she said, “your role is support and safety. Not control. We want monitored decisions and clear follow-ups.”

I nodded.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s what I want.”

She explained options as frameworks, not fantasies: what was considered, what required monitoring, what was never a DIY project, what could be paused if Charli needed to reassess. No selling. No theatre. Just reality with rails.

Charli listened like someone starving for structure.

“So I don’t have to decide… everything at once?” she asked.

“No,” the specialist said. “You decide what you need right now to reduce distress and stay safe. We monitor. We reassess. You keep agency.”

I watched Charli’s shoulders lower.

Not dramatically. Not like a miracle.

Like a nervous system being told it didn’t have to be alone.

When we left, she walked a little more evenly. Her eyes were less hunted.

In the car, I didn’t start the engine right away. I sat with my hands on the wheel and let reality settle.

If you’d like, I can do one more *tiny* pass to sharpen the “Lauren wobble” even more (one or two deliberate “son/he” memory spikes early, each self-corrected), but I didn’t want to over-salt it unless you explicitly want the gut-punch to be stronger.


<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">










Absolutely. For maximum punch, we do three things—cleanly, on purpose:

1. **Let Lauren’s first reflex be “my son / he”** in her *internal* narration (never in dialogue once the plan begins).
2. **Show her catching herself**—not apologising, not spiralling—*auditing*, the way she audits everything.
3. **Use the wobble as a stress meter**: the more danger and fear, the more the old grammar tries to reassert; the more structure and competent care enters, the more “she” holds.

Below is the same scene, but “wobble-enhanced” for impact. I’ve kept your tone: managerial, daylight-proof, no soap opera—just a mother’s heart under a hard standard.

## Scene 37 — “The Call” / “The Referral” (Lauren POV, punch pass)

Celeste didn’t ring me like a girl with gossip.

She rang me like a manager reporting a safety breach.

“Lauren,” she said, voice controlled, “Charli is safe. But I found something in the bathroom cabinet. Capsules. She’s been taking them for three months. She says it’s because she’s scared of masculinising changes.”

There was a second—one clean second—where my brain refused to accept the sentence.

Capsules. Three months. In secret.

My hand tightened around the phone until my knuckles hurt.

“How safe?” I asked.

“Safe right now,” Celeste said. “She stopped. I’ve got them. She didn’t want to tell you. I’m telling you.”

I closed my eyes.

She.

Celeste had said it the way you say *fire exit* or *first aid kit*—not as a declaration, as a direction. Practical. Correct inside the situation.

My own mind—traitor, muscle-memory—tried to throw the old word up like a shield.

*My son. He—*

No.

Not *no* as in refusal. *No* as in: stop panicking, Lauren. Listen. Track facts.

I opened my eyes again.

Celeste’s voice didn’t wobble. It didn’t apologise for consequence. It simply held the line.

And in that instant I understood something I’d only half understood before: Celeste wasn’t a romantic interest drifting through Charli’s life. She was a standard-bearer. A young woman who treated ethics like physics.

“Okay,” I said, because okay was what you said when you needed to keep breathing. “I’m coming.”

“Good,” Celeste replied. “We need a plan. Not blame.”

Not blame.

My chest tightened with gratitude I didn’t quite have words for.

“I’ll be there tonight,” I said.

“Drive safe,” she said, and hung up as if the call were a transaction: information delivered, action set.

I stood in my kitchen and stared at nothing.

A memory rose—Charli at four years old, cheeks sticky with jam, trying to tie shoelaces with a concentration that looked like prayer. He’d always been like that: careful, earnest, determined to be useful.

Useful was his religion.

And now useful had nearly killed—

No. Again: the mind trying to simplify.

Not useful. Not the trait. The *fear*. The secrecy. The quiet self-erasure that made “being no trouble” feel like morality.

My child had been terrified.

My child had swallowed capsules alone.

I picked up my keys.

Winter down there wasn’t like winter in stories.

It didn’t feel cinematic. It felt like wind that found your bones. The kind of cold that made you realise how much you depended on walls.

By the time I pulled up outside Celeste’s place, the sky was already that dull metallic grey that arrives early and stays late. The air stung. My breath fogged.

Charli was at the kitchen table.

She looked up when she saw me.

The look on her face made my heart squeeze so hard I nearly lost my breath.

Not guilty in the way a child looks guilty when they’ve broken a rule.

Guilty in the way a good person looks when she’s been terrified and reckless and is now ashamed of the terror itself.

“Mum,” she said, small.

And there—there it was.

The old word surged up like a reflexive hand reaching for a railing.

*My boy. My son. He’s—*

I felt my jaw clench.

Not at her.

At myself.

Because even now—*especially now*—my brain wanted to convert her into something familiar so I could bear it.

But familiarity had been a kind of blindness before. Familiarity was how you miss a crisis until it’s in a bottle behind the floss.

I did not get to be blind again.

I wanted to go to her immediately—to wrap her up, to scold her, to do all the mother things at once.

I didn’t.

Charli didn’t respond well to spectacle. Comfort that was too loud turned into debt in her head. She would start managing *my* feelings instead of dealing with her own crisis.

So I walked to the table. I sat down. I put my keys next to my bag.

“Three months.”

My stomach dropped and then steadied into anger’s cold, practical sister: resolve.

“Where did you get them?” I asked.

Charli hesitated, then whispered, “Online.”

My child had turned her body into a DIY project because she was scared and didn’t believe she was allowed to ask for help.

My throat tightened.

For a split second, my mind tried to bargain: *Maybe it’s just—maybe it’s a phase—maybe it’s—*

No.

That’s not support. That’s self-soothing dressed up as parenting.

Celeste set a small bottle on the table.

Not a slam. An exhibit.

“I took these,” she said. “I’m not leaving them accessible. Not to punish you. To keep you safe.”

I nodded once, grateful.

Then I turned back to Charli and let steel into my voice—not cruelty, not humiliation. Consequence.

“Charli,” I said, “you are never taking secret medicine again.”

Her eyes squeezed shut.

“I know,” she whispered.

“No,” I said. “You know now because you got caught. I need you to know because you understand. Because you choose it.”

She looked up then, eyes wet.

“I didn’t want to be difficult,” she said.

That sentence hit me harder than the capsules.

Because it was the sentence underneath everything.

I felt my throat tighten. I kept my voice steady.

“You are not difficult for needing care,” I said. “Do you understand me?”

She nodded, barely.

Celeste spoke again, still calm, still firm.

“I want her seen by a doctor,” she said. “Properly. Supervised. Documented. Specialist referral if needed. No improvising.”

I looked at her and felt something close to relief.

This was what competence looked like: not panic, not pity, not ideology.

A plan.

“Yes,” I said. “We do it properly.”

Charli’s shoulders sagged as if she’d been holding herself up with willpower alone.

“I’m scared,” she admitted.

I let myself soften a fraction.

“I know,” I said. “And we’re still doing it properly.”

---

The waiting room the next day smelled like disinfectant and cheap tea. I sat with my coat folded on my lap like armour.

Charli sat beside me, very still.

Her hair was tied back, neat. Her face looked cared for in that plain, functional way—maintenance, not performance.

And that, perversely, made me angry again, because it proved how much she *could* do when she believed she was allowed.

The clinician was calm and clean and unshowy. She spoke to Charli first, which I appreciated. She asked questions that weren’t traps, asked them twice in different ways, letting the truth settle into the room like sediment.

Charli tried, at first, to keep it in the language she knew.

“Blending,” she said. “Costumes. Not standing out.”

The clinician nodded.

“And what happens inside you when masculinising changes show up?” she asked.

Charli stared at her hands.

“I feel… horrified,” she said, and the word came out like it hurt. “Like I’m being forced.”

“And when your body reads more androgynous?” the clinician asked.

Charli’s shoulders lowered slightly.

“I can breathe,” she said.

The clinician let silence sit, then said something that landed like a stamp without being a shove.

“Charli, what you’re describing is consistent with gender dysphoria,” she said.

Charli’s head snapped up.

“But I’m not—” she began, and stopped, trapped by the weight of labels.

I felt the old grammar twitch again—*my son*—as if naming it differently might pull us back onto a familiar road.

I swallowed it.

Familiar roads were how you drive past the warning sign because you don’t like what it implies.

The clinician didn’t force a label onto Charli.

“I’m not asking you to define identity today,” she said gently. “I’m describing a pattern of distress. The distress matters. The risk you took matters. We treat the distress, and we keep you safe while you figure out the rest.”

My chest tightened—grief, relief, fear, and something like vindication tangled together.

Because the truth was: I’d known something was off for years.

Not in a dramatic way. In a mother way. In that quiet sense that your child is fighting a battle she doesn’t have words for.

I’d thought it was depression. Anxiety. The cruelty of adolescence.

Maybe it had been all of that.

But this—this was clearer. This was a shape.

The clinician printed a referral and slid it across the desk.

“A specialist,” she said. “With the pattern documented. So you don’t have to improvise in the dark.”

I took the paper and looked at it the way I looked at a school report: not judgement—information that dictated next steps.

Charli stared at it like it might bite.

I put my hand flat on the desk near it—not touching her, not forcing comfort. Just present.

“We’re doing this properly,” I said.

She nodded, the smallest motion.

---

The specialist appointment was a week later. A woman with crisp competence—direct without being cold—met Charli’s eyes first and kept her there.

She asked about goals in plain language: what Charli feared, what she hoped for, what she could tolerate, what she couldn’t.

Then she looked at me.

“Lauren,” she said, “your role is support and safety. Not control. We want monitored decisions and clear follow-ups.”

I nodded.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s what I want.”

She explained options as frameworks, not fantasies: what was considered, what required monitoring, what was never a DIY project, what could be paused if Charli needed to reassess. No selling. No theatre. Just reality with rails.

Charli listened like someone starving for structure.

“So I don’t have to decide… everything at once?” she asked.

“No,” the specialist said. “You decide what you need right now to reduce distress and stay safe. We monitor. We reassess. You keep agency.”

I watched Charli’s shoulders lower.

Not dramatically. Not like a miracle.

Like a nervous system being told it didn’t have to be alone.

When we left, she walked a little more evenly. Her eyes were less hunted.

In the car, I didn’t start the engine right away. I sat with my hands on the wheel and let reality settle.

My child had dysphoria.

My child had tried to treat it alone because she didn’t think she deserved supervised help.

And now—now she had a plan with adults around her who understood risk and consent and monitoring.

I turned to her.

“You’re not in trouble for being afraid,” I said.

She swallowed hard. “It felt like it would ruin everything.”

I shook my head slowly.

“It doesn’t ruin everything,” I said. “It tells us what we have to take seriously.”

Her eyes shone. She looked away quickly.

“And,” I added, steel returning, “you are never doing secret medicine again.”

She nodded. “I won’t.”

I held the wheel tighter.

“Also,” I said, “you are not allowed to call yourself difficult for needing care.”

She made a small sound—half laugh, half heartbreak. “Mum…”

“I’m not raising a martyr,” I said. “I’m raising a person who asks for help before she risks her life.”

Charli stared out the window for a moment, then nodded again.

“Okay,” she whispered.

I started the car.

As we pulled away, my mind—inevitably—flicked to Celeste.

To the way she’d handled discovery with consequence instead of shame. To the way she’d pulled me in without drama and then stepped back, letting me be the mother while still holding standards like scaffolding.

I didn’t know what their relationship would become.

But I knew one thing with startling clarity:

Charli was safer with women who treated care as a system, not as a mood.

And if she was going to get through this—not by toughening up into masculinity, but by finding a shape she could live in—the only acceptable path was the one we’d finally chosen:

Supervised. Documented. Monitored.

No secrets.

No heroics.

Just standards.

---

If you want even *more* sting, the next step is to insert one surgical line right after Celeste’s first “she” (something like: **“My tongue wanted to correct her. My stomach wanted to beg her not to.”**), but I held back because this version already hits hard without turning Lauren into someone messy.

---

[Q]    
I think you have achieved perfectly with this version, Emily. It's pretty impactful as is.

---

[A]  
Good. Then I wouldn’t touch the emotional pitch at all.

If you’re doing a *production* pass (not a rewrite), the only tweaks I’d consider—purely for continuity + maximum “Lauren’s heart on the page”—are micro-level and optional:

* **Lock the pronoun rule you just established:** Lauren can *feel* the old grammar twitch, but she never lets it leak into dialogue once the plan is in motion. You’ve already got that. Keep it.
* **One consistency sweep:** make sure any stray “clinician / psychiatrist / endocrinologist” labels match your intended sequence (you’ve now got “clinician” + “specialist appointment” which reads clean and avoids real-world specificity).
* **Echo-word continuity:** you used “properly / supervised / documented / monitored” as a mantra. That’s great—don’t dilute it in later scenes. Let it become Lauren’s version of Wardrobe policy language.

If you paste Scene 36 (Celeste discovers the capsules) and Scene 37 (this one) into your master doc back-to-back, they’ll land like a one-two punch: **Celeste enforces safety → Lauren converts it into a system.** That’s exactly the kind of “women’s competence network” power your story does best.

Whenever you’re ready, send the next scene that follows *after* the referral—because the real fun is what happens when Charli tries to go back to Wardrobe carrying a new kind of “definition,” and the women decide, quietly, how the room will hold her.
