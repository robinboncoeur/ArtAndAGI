# Scene 31



## From 25.01.05

Celeste didn’t think of it as intimacy.

That was the sort of word people used when they wanted to excuse something sloppy.

In here, everything had a name and a purpose. Mara had trained the room that way: labels on drawers, headings on ledgers, procedures taped to the wall in plain sight. If you couldn’t describe what you were doing without blushing, you weren’t doing it at Wardrobe.

The shipment had gone out. Two hundred units, boxed and pallet-wrapped and hauled away with a driver who looked faintly scared of Mara’s clipboard. The workroom still smelled like cardboard and steam and that flat metallic tang that clung to needles when you’d been at it too long.

It was quieter now. Not calm—quiet the way a machine goes quiet between cycles.

Celeste stood by the cutting table, flipping through the post-mortem sheet with one hand and pinching the bridge of her nose with the other. Columns: *Failure points. Fix applied. Re-test.* A neat list of what had held and what had not.

Behind her, Charli moved with that careful, economical impatience she got when she'd tried to do something alone too long.

She was wear-testing again. Not because anyone had “asked”—because the revised chemise needed a second run, and because she'd logged the first run without theatrics, and because she never lied about what pulled or rode up or chafed.

Her job was to be honest when the fabric wasn’t.

The chemise itself wasn’t the problem anymore. The neckline sat properly now. The sleeve cuffs had enough ease. The seams didn’t bite when she lifted her arms above her head. The notes she'd given were, as usual, surgical: *two inches too tight across upper back under sustained reach; stitch tension at side seam causes micro-rolling; adjust seam allowance; retest.*

What was getting her, now, was her hair.

She'd grown it out for the 1770s work—at first as a practical concession to period silhouette, then because it stopped being a novelty and became just… her. It was long enough to catch in things. Long enough to hold sweat and pins. Long enough to make her look, at a glance, like someone who belonged on the far side of the room in the fitting mirror with the girls, not in the doorway holding a box cutter.

At the moment, it hung down her back in a thick dark fall, slightly damp at the nape. She'd tried to gather it up one-handed while still moving, still testing, still being useful. She'd gotten it twisted once, then lost it again, then caught a pin between her fingers and hersed when it stabbed her.

The sound was small, but it went through Celeste like a snapped thread.

She didn’t turn right away. She watched, in peripheral vision, as she did the thing she always did when she hit a minor limit: she tightened. Not dramatically. Just enough that her shoulders rose a fraction and her breath became shallow and contained.

She was trying to muscle her way through a problem that did not respond to force.

Celeste put the post-mortem sheet down, aligned it square with the edge of the table, and let her palm rest there for a beat—an unnecessary gesture of control she did when she needed to shift gears.

Then she turned.

Charli had the brush in one hand now. It was one of Mara’s utilitarian things: wood handle, stiff bristles, no pretty curve, no indulgence. She'd tried two strokes. The brush caught immediately in a knot near the nape, tugged at the skin, and her whole body flinched in reflex.

She made an annoyed sound under her breath. Not a curse. She was careful even when she was frustrated, as if language could injure a room.

Celeste crossed to her and stopped just outside her space.

“Sit,” she said.

Charli blinked. “I’m fine.”

It wasn’t defiance. It was reflex—her default insistence that nothing was wrong, that nothing required anyone’s time.

Celeste tilted her head, not unkindly, and let the pause do the work.

“You’re not ‘fine.’ You’re trying to win an argument with hair.”

Her mouth twitched, almost a smile, then vanished. She looked down at the brush like it had betrayed her.

“I can do it,” she said, quieter. Determined. The same tone she used when she thought the only way to be worthy was to provide.

Celeste’s voice stayed level. “You can also sit.”

She hesitated.

Celeste didn’t reach for her. She didn’t touch her shoulder. She didn’t take the brush out of her hand. She simply held her own hand out—palm up—like a technician asking for a tool.

Charli stared at that open hand for a second, like the room had shifted subtly under her feet.

“Is ther… okay?” she asked. It came out awkward, because she wasn’t used to being asked for permission and then being the one who had to answer.

Celeste’s chest tightened and warmed at once. Not because it was cute. Because it was *clean.*

“Good question,” she said. “Yes or no. I’m not guessing.”

Her throat moved.

“Yes,” she said.

And then, because she couldn’t help herself, she added softly, “If you want.”

Celeste’s eyes narrowed just a fraction. She took the brush from her fingers with steady care, but she didn’t let that line pass.

“Not ‘if I want.’” Her tone wasn’t harsh; it was exact. “If you want.”

Charli’s gaze lifted to her, briefly. She looked like someone who had been corrected in a way that made her safer, not smaller.

“I want,” she said.

“Good.” Celeste nodded once. “Chair.”

She moved to the simple wooden chair by the sewing station and sat. Her posture remained held, as if sitting was a kind of failure. Her hands stayed in her lap, fingers laced together, knuckles pale.

Celeste stood behind her and gathered the heavy fall of her hair carefully, assessing with the same attention she used on fabric. Where it was damp. Where it was tangled. Where the strain points were.

She lifted it away from her neck, and she exhaled as if she hadn’t realised she was holding her breath.

That, more than anything, made her still.

Not arousal. Not embarrassment. Relief.

The first brush stroke was purely procedural. Start at the ends, work upward. Detangle without yanking. Don’t punish the scalp for a knot.

The second stroke smoothed a section and caught again, gentler. Charli flinched reflexively, then stopped herself—like a person unlearning the expectation of pain.

Celeste adjusted her angle without comment and went in again, slower, patient as a seam ripper.

After half a dozen strokes, her shoulders lowered a fraction.

She didn’t melt. She didn’t lean back. She didn’t make a sound.

She simply… allowed it.

And that allowance rang in Celeste’s body like an answer she hadn’t realised she'd been asking since the first day she'd seen her.

The restroom flash came uninvited, sharp as a photograph.

Not the scandal of it. Not the narrative people would slap onto it if they knew. The *feeling*—the immediate quiet certainty she'd had in her chest when she'd looked at her and her brain had said, with strange calm: *Ther is not danger. Ther is not entitlement. Ther is someone trying to get through something without taking anything from anyone.*

She'd thought, then, that it was simply decency.

She knew better now.

Decency was common enough. Boys could perform it for applause. Men could weaponise it for access.

There wasn’t performance.

There was… alignment.

She went still in the way girls went still when another girl helped them—when the help was not a prelude, not a hook, not a claim. When the help was just help, competent and unremarked.

Celeste felt her own breath shift. She slowed without meaning to.

The brush moved steadily, making that soft dry whisper through the strands. The workroom was quiet enough that the sound became a kind of metronome.

She realised, with a small jolt that felt almost like irritation, that she had been restrained for too long.

Not from shame. From discipline. From the fear of becoming entitled.

She'd kept herself “correct.” She'd corrected culture, corrected language, corrected drift. She'd kept her stake invisible because she didn’t believe in staking people.

And in doing so, she'd let the room misread her.

She'd let Tilly drift into the edges. She'd let the girls treat her like a novelty. She'd let outsiders think she was available for their curiosity, their jokes, their soft little social experiments.

Not because Celeste hadn’t cared.

Because she'd refused to behave like a person who cared.

Charli’s shoulders dropped another fraction, as if her body could feel her thought moving.

Celeste paused with the brush held midair and looked at her—her profile, the line of her jaw, the slight tension at the corner of her mouth as she tried not to take up space.

“You didn’t do anything wrong,” she said.

Charli blinked, startled by words that didn’t match any question she'd asked.

“I—what?”

Celeste resumed brushing, gentler. “The hair. You’re treating it like you have to win.”

Her mouth opened, then shut. She looked down at her hands.

Celeste’s voice stayed calm, but there was steel under it now.

“You don’t have to earn care here.”

Her fingers tightened together.

“I wasn’t—” she started, and stopped, as if she couldn’t find a sentence that didn’t sound like apology.

Celeste didn’t let her spiral into self-correction.

“I know what you do,” she said. “You log. You fix. You carry things quietly. You think that makes you safe to keep.”

Charli’s head dipped, the smallest movement.

Celeste brushed through a long section, smooth now, and felt something in her chest ease in a way that was almost frightening.

“That isn’t the deal,” she said.

Silence.

She continued, because she needed ther said, and if she waited until she was emotional she'd say it wrong.

“I’m not indifferent,” Celeste said. “I’ve been disciplined.”

Charli’s breath caught. She didn’t turn. She didn’t ask for more. She simply listened, as if she didn’t trust her own right to.

Celeste gathered her hair in her hand and began to twist it into a tie at the nape—neat, functional, secure. The way you secured a garment before a test. The way you secured a person inside a system so they couldn’t be casually mishandled.

“I corrected Tilly because she was two inches too close,” Celeste said, matter-of-fact. “That was the rule. But the reason I felt it so sharply is… I’m not neutral.”

Charli’s shoulders went very still, as if her body had decided not to move until it knew the terms.

Celeste finished the tie, tugged it gently to check it would hold, and let her hand rest at the back of her neck for exactly one second—contact as brief and deliberate as a signature at the bottom of a contract.

Then she stepped away.

“I saw you,” she said, quietly. Not romantic. Not dramatic. Like a verdict.

Charli turned her head slightly, enough that she could see the corner of her eye. Her expression wasn’t triumphant. It was stunned. Like someone who’d been told, for the first time, that the thing she'd been hiding wasn’t a liability.

Celeste kept her face composed. If she let herself soften too much, the room would swallow the moment and turn it into sentiment. That was how people lost their standards.

“Are we clear?” she asked.

Charli swallowed. “Yes.”

“Good.” Celeste nodded once. “Now you can move.”

She stood, cautiously, testing the tie without touching it. The way she tested everything—by moving inside it and noting what held.

Celeste picked up the post-mortem sheet again and slid it into place on the table, anchoring herself back in daylight.

“The revised seam allowance needs another run,” she said, businesslike. “You have fifteen minutes in that chemise. Then we log. Then you eat something that isn’t caffeine.”

Charli’s mouth twitched again, that almost-smile.

“Yes, boss,” she murmured, and the words were affectionate only in the sense that compliance could be affection when it was chosen.

Celeste looked up. “Don’t call me that.”

Her eyes flicked to hers, startled again.

Celeste’s gaze held, steady.

“I’m not your boss,” she said. “I’m your lead. There’s a difference.”

Charli nodded once, solemn as if she'd just been handed a rule she could live inside.

“Okay,” she said.

Celeste let herself exhale.

“Keep it clean,” she said. “Then back to work.”

And it wasn’t a dismissal.

It was a promise.
