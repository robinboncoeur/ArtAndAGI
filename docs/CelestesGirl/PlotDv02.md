Oh yes—this sings. Victorian Faire is perfect: rules, roles, and just enough spectacle for small public tests. Celeste is cast as a lady (power via status), Charlie’s miscast (stable lad), and she engineers the correction with charm and procedure. Below are four 8-panel strips that form a clean mini-arc: **Rescue → Reassignment → Fitting → First Music Lesson.** Each panel has lean balloon text and staging notes so you can lay them out fast.

---

### Strip 1 — “Muck & Measure” (the rescue)

**Cast:** Celeste (decisive), Charlie (muddied, exhausted), Mr. Briggs (stablemaster, harried)

**Panel 1 – Stable yard, morning fog**

* *Art:* Charlie with shovel, boots splashed; Celeste in neat walking dress, parasol.
* *Charlie (small):* “I’m… fine. Really.”
* *Celeste (cool):* “You’re miscast.”

**Panel 2 – Celeste lifts the duty roster slate**

* *Celeste:* “Who assigned ‘Charles H.’ to muck-out?”
* *Briggs:* “We were short lads. He’s slight—quick.”

**Panel 3 – Celeste, parasol tip on the roster**

* *Celeste:* “He was hired as household support. Not livestock.”
* *Briggs (shrug):* “Work’s work.”

**Panel 4 – Celeste, polite steel**

* *Celeste:* “Work is also accurate. He reports to me now.”
* *Briggs (taken aback):* “…Do you even have a billet?”

**Panel 5 – She produces a folded card (her Lady’s pass)**

* *Celeste:* “Lady’s pass, tier two. Entitles a maid. He’s mine.”
* *Charlie (hushed):* “Mine?”

**Panel 6 – Briggs rubs neck, glances at muck heap**

* *Briggs:* “You’ll have to clear it with Hiring.”
* *Celeste:* “Already penciled in. Thank you for the loan.”

**Panel 7 – She takes Charlie’s shovel, plants it upright**

* *Celeste (to Charlie):* “Drop this. Keep your dignity.”
* *Charlie:* “I don’t know how.”

**Panel 8 – Celeste offers her handkerchief; they exit**

* *Celeste:* “You’ll get used to it.”
* *Charlie (small breath):* “I’ll try.”

---

### Strip 2 — “The Petition” (reassignment, women decide)

**Cast:** Celeste, Charlie (cleaner now, still wary), Mrs. Penfold (Hiring & Wardrobe, crisp, late 40s)

**Panel 1 – Hiring Office, shelves of ledgers**

* *Celeste:* “I’m converting Charles H. to lady’s maid. Immediate effect.”
* *Mrs. Penfold (arch):* “On what grounds?”

**Panel 2 – Celeste slides a neat written petition**

* *Celeste:* “Contract cites ‘domestic service, public-facing’. Stables are neither.”
* *Mrs. Penfold (scans):* “Concise. Rare.”

**Panel 3 – Charlie clutches cap, unsure**

* *Charlie (murmur):* “I can be useful. Just… not with hooves.”
* *Mrs. Penfold (kind):* “We prefer hands that don’t tremble around ladies.”

**Panel 4 – Ledger close-up; Penfold writes ‘REASSIGNED: LADY’S MAID (PROVISIONAL)’**

* *Mrs. Penfold:* “Trial week. You shadow her schedule.”
* *Celeste:* “And he’ll tutor me in music.”

**Panel 5 – Penfold pauses, curious**

* *Mrs. Penfold:* “Barter of skills?”
* *Celeste:* “Mutual advancement. Best kind.”

**Panel 6 – Ink stamp THUNK**

* *Mrs. Penfold:* “Approved. Collect your livery. House rules apply.”
* *Charlie:* “What are the rules?”

**Panel 7 – Penfold with a thin smile**

* *Mrs. Penfold:* “Listen. Be early. Look finished.”
* *Celeste (aside to Charlie):* “We can do that.”

**Panel 8 – Exit, Celeste re-folds petition for Charlie**

* *Celeste:* “Keep this. Proof matters.”
* *Charlie (soft):* “Thank you, miss.”

---

### Strip 3 — “Livery to Laces” (fitting room, quiet dignity)

**Cast:** Celeste, Charlie, Seamstress Ada (brisk, late 20s)

**Panel 1 – Wardrobe room, dressforms, ribbons**

* *Ada:* “Provisional maid’s set. Don’t touch the lace yet.”
* *Charlie (small laugh):* “It might bite?”

**Panel 2 – Celeste lays out apron, blouse, simple skirt**

* *Celeste:* “Function first. Apron protects; blouse breathes.”
* *Charlie:* “It’s… neat.”

**Panel 3 – Close: collar, two buttons open**

* *Celeste:* “Top two stay open. Relax the throat.”
* *Charlie:* “Feels less trapped.”

**Panel 4 – Ada measures sleeve; chalk marks**

* *Ada:* “Arms down, love. We fit to posture, not nerves.”
* *Charlie:* “Right. Sorry.”

**Panel 5 – Mirror: first look in full set (modest, tidy)**

* *Charlie (quiet):* “Different.”
* *Celeste (firm, kind):* “Different is alignment.”

**Panel 6 – Celeste adjusts his stance, weight on balls of feet**

* *Celeste:* “Lengthen here. Soften there. Hold the tray in mind.”
* *Charlie:* “I don’t have a tray.”

**Panel 7 – Ada hands a prop tray; he balances it**

* *Ada (approving):* “Now you do.”
* *Charlie (focused):* “…I can.”

**Panel 8 – Celeste ties a simple ribbon at his nape**

* *Celeste:* “Household says finished. I say ready.”
* *Charlie (tiny smile):* “Ready enough.”

---

### Strip 4 — “Counterpoint, Kindly” (first music lesson swap)

**Cast:** Celeste, Charlie, Mrs. Hargrave (Tea Room proprietor, composed)

**Panel 1 – Tea room side table, ledger, teacups**

* *Hargrave:* “You two may use the side alcove. Keep it quiet.”
* *Celeste:* “We’ll trade silence for skill.”

**Panel 2 – Charlie sets out pencil, staff paper**

* *Charlie:* “Scales first?”
* *Celeste:* “Purpose first. I want to notate what I hear.”

**Panel 3 – She hums a four-note motif**

* *Celeste:* “Write this, then vary it once.”
* *Charlie (scribbling):* “Okay… third up, then down.”

**Panel 4 – He slides the paper; she studies**

* *Celeste:* “Your stems are tidy. Good.”
* *Charlie (surprised):* “That matters?”

**Panel 5 – She taps the barline**

* *Celeste:* “Clarity invites courage. Again—new ending.”
* *Charlie:* “You’re very sure.”

**Panel 6 – Celeste, level gaze (gentle authority)**

* *Celeste:* “I don’t waste time doubting what helps.”
* *Charlie (soft):* “I’m trying.”

**Panel 7 – She copies his motif back, improved phrasing**

* *Celeste:* “Now you correct me.”
* *Charlie (finding voice):* “Tie this note. It breathes.”

**Panel 8 – They both smile, small and real**

* *Celeste:* “There. Mutual advancement.”
* *Charlie:* “I don’t hate any of this.”
* *Celeste (signature):* “You’ll get used to it.”

---

**How to pace this arc across a page/spread**

* **Page 1:** Strips 1–2 (Rescue + Reassignment) — problem defined and solved by women with procedure and poise.
* **Page 2:** Strips 3–4 (Fitting + First Lesson) — skill-building in dress and in music; Charlie’s reluctance softens into capability.

**Reusable motifs & props (Victorian Faire flavor)**

* **Authority tokens:** Lady’s pass, stamped petitions, the ledger—visual shorthand for earned power.
* **Household skills:** Balancing a tray, tying a ribbon, adjusting posture—quiet, G-rated competence beats.
* **Music shorthand:** Four-note motif on staff paper; “purpose first” as Celeste’s mantra; “clarity invites courage.”

**Optional follow-ups (if you want more 8-panel beats)**

* **“Errand at the Milliner”:** Celeste has him ask for “quiet colors” and pay; clerk affirms “you look finished.”
* **“The Household Test”:** Mrs. Hargrave runs a timed tea service; Charlie passes by staying early and calm.
* **“First Small Audience”:** Celeste plays a line on a borrowed instrument; Charlie turns pages; two older women nod approval—no spectacle, just earned grace.

If you’d like, I’ll script those next two (milliner + tea service) to round out the week, or adapt any of the above to your exact balloon length and panel dimensions.

🥳 yesss! riding that momentum, here are the next two 8-panel strips to round out the “Victorian Faire” arc—**Milliner errand** and **Timed tea service**—still PG, still firm, still Celeste-led.

---

### Strip 5 — “Quiet Colors” (the milliner errand)

**Cast:** Celeste, Charlie, Miss Doyle (milliner, mid-30s; exacting, kind)

**Panel 1 – Milliner’s shop, ribbons and hatboxes**

* *Charlie (small):* “What am I asking for?”
* *Celeste (calm):* “Quiet colors and a workable pin.”

**Panel 2 – Counter; Miss Doyle approaches**

* *Miss Doyle:* “Good morning. Need finishing pieces?”
* *Charlie (finding voice):* “Yes, please. For a lady’s maid.”

**Panel 3 – Swatch fan opens (dove, moss, wine)**

* *Miss Doyle:* “Function first?”
* *Charlie:* “Yes. Nothing that shouts.”

**Panel 4 – Celeste lifts a moss ribbon, tests drape**

* *Celeste:* “Moss reads capable. Agreed?”
* *Charlie (surprised):* “Agreed.”

---

### Strip 6 — “The Household Test” (timed tea service)

**Cast:** Celeste, Charlie, Mrs. Hargrave (tea room proprietor), Two Ladies (patrons)

**Panel 1 – Back of tea room; clock on wall**

* *Mrs. Hargrave:* “Tray for table four. Two minutes, steady hands.”
* *Charlie (gulp):* “Two minutes.”

**Panel 2 – Celeste squares his shoulders**

* *Celeste:* “Lengthen. Breathe. Count quietly.”
* *Charlie:* “One-and-two…”

**Panel 3 – Load tray: pot, two cups, sugar**

* *Charlie (soft):* “Weight’s left.”
* *Celeste:* “Shift to the balls of your feet.”

**Panel 4 – Mid-floor, a child darts past**

* *Charlie:* “Obstacle.”
* *Celeste:* “Pause. Let life pass. Then continue.”

**Panel 5 – At table four; small bow**

* *Charlie:* “Tea for you, ma’am.”
* *Lady 1 (pleasant):* “Thank you.”

**Panel 6 – Pouring; no spill, eyes on the cup**

* *Mrs. Hargrave (off):* “Cup first, then eyes.”
* *Charlie:* “Right.”

**Panel 7 – Clock: a soft tick before the bell**

* *Mrs. Hargrave:* “One breath to spare.”
* *Lady 2 (approving):* “Very finished.”

**Panel 8 – Back room; Celeste straightens his ribbon**

* *Charlie (exhale):* “That felt… possible.”
* *Celeste (warm):* “Possible becomes habit.”

---

**Quick production notes**

* **Props that read on the page:** moss ribbon, hat pin, tray with two cups. Keep silhouettes clean.
* **Beat rhythm:** 1) task, 2) posture cue, 3) tool/weight cue, 4) micro-hazard, 5) address, 6) precision, 7) validation, 8) ethos line.
* **Reusable lines:** “Function first.” “Finished, not fussy.” “Let life pass, then continue.”

Want a final strip where Celeste publicly credits Charlie’s notation at a tiny bandstand (“Paperwork & Praise”), cementing his reassignment? I can script that next.


<a href="/assets/images/PlotDev/Celeste03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
<img src="/assets/images/PlotDev/Celeste03.jpg" alt="Celeste" width="360" align="left"></a>


Oh, I’m very happy to help. We can keep this firmly PG, character-driven, and centered on consent and care—reluctance without resistance, and an aunt who’s calmly in charge for all the right reasons. Below are three different 8-panel beats you could use as self-contained strips or as a sequence. I’ll include tight balloon text and simple staging notes so you can lay them out quickly.

---

### Strip A — “The Fitting” (gentle mentorship)

**Cast:** Evan (college-age), Aunt Mara (decisive, warm)

**Panel 1 – Hallway threshold**

* *Art:* Evan hesitates at a bedroom door; warm lamplight inside.
* *Evan (small):* “Are we… really doing this?”
* *Aunt Mara (off, steady):* “We are. Come in.”

**Panel 2 – Bed with neatly laid outfit**

* *Art:* Blouse, skirt, tights, soft flats arranged like a plan.
* *Evan:* “It looks… thorough.”
* *Aunt Mara (smile):* “It’s thoughtful. There’s a difference.”

**Panel 3 – Mirror, blouse held up to chest**

* *Evan:* “I’m not sure it’s me.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “It’s you trying. That’s enough for today.”

**Panel 4 – Close on buttons**

* *Aunt Mara (hands steady, mid-button):* “Top two stay open. You’ll breathe easier.”
* *Evan:* “I feel obvious.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “You feel seen. That’s progress.”

**Panel 5 – Skirt at hips (tasteful, non-salacious)**

* *Evan:* “Is there a right way?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “There’s a respectful way. Slow. Considered.”

**Panel 6 – First look in mirror**

* *Evan (tiny):* “…different.”
* *Aunt Mara (firm, kind):* “Different isn’t wrong.”

**Panel 7 – Posture correction**

* *Aunt Mara (guiding shoulders):* “Lengthen here. Soften here. Let your weight find the ball of the foot.”
* *Evan:* “Feels strange.”
* *Aunt Mara (signature line):* “You’ll get used to it.”

**Panel 8 – Exit frame, hallway again**

* *Evan (a breath, braver):* “Okay. I can try the shoes.”
* *Aunt Mara (pleased):* “That’s my nephew. And my student.”

**Theme notes:** Aunt is correct, composed, and practical; Evan is hesitant but consenting. No comedy at his expense—only quiet growth.

---

### Strip B — “Why Today” (practical necessity, public outing prep)

**Cast:** Evan, Aunt Mara

**Panel 1 – Kitchen table with invitation/flyer (choir recital / charity lunch)**

* *Evan:* “Do I have to go dressed… like that?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “We’re attending as ourselves. Today that includes your experiment.”

**Panel 2 – Coffee steam between them (soft tension)**

* *Evan:* “What if people stare?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Let them practice minding their own business.”

**Panel 3 – Makeup pouch opens (minimal items)**

* *Aunt Mara:* “Tinted balm. Brow tidy. That’s it.”
* *Evan:* “No full face?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “You’re not a costume. You’re a person.”

**Panel 4 – Shoes by the door (flats and his old sneakers)**

* *Evan (touching sneakers):* “These are easier.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Easier isn’t always kinder to your future.”

**Panel 5 – Hair adjustment at mirror**

* *Aunt Mara:* “Behind the ear says ‘present.’ Falling forward says ‘hiding.’ Choose.”
* *Evan:* “Present, I guess.”

**Panel 6 – Test step in flats**

* *Evan:* “I keep overthinking my feet.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Good. You’ll think less once they learn.”

**Panel 7 – Doorway, hand on knob**

* *Evan:* “If it goes badly…?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “We leave. I decide. You’re safe.”

**Panel 8 – Outside light washes in**

* *Evan (small smile):* “Okay. I’m ready enough.”
* *Aunt Mara (final):* “Ready is a direction, not a gate.”

**Theme notes:** Aunt frames this as skill-building and safety. She sets the boundary and owns the exit strategy—decisive and right.

---

### Strip C — “The Heirloom” (identity through object, mild ceremony)

**Cast:** Evan, Aunt Mara

**Panel 1 – Cedar box on dresser**

* *Evan:* “What’s in there?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Women who survived. And a ribbon.”

**Panel 2 – Box opens: simple silk ribbon, old photo of great-aunt**

* *Evan:* “She looks… sure of herself.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “She had to be. She chose to be.”

**Panel 3 – Ribbon held between them**

* *Evan:* “You’re not making fun of me?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “I don’t waste family on jokes.”

**Panel 4 – Ribbon tied at nape (gentle, practical)**

* *Evan:* “It’s tight.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “It’s a reminder to lift your chin.”

**Panel 5 – Mirror, side profile**

* *Evan (soft):* “I can kind of… see it.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Name what ‘it’ is for you.”

**Panel 6 – Close on photo beside mirror**

* *Evan:* “Not pretending. Just… trying on another angle.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Angles reveal structure.”

**Panel 7 – He smiles, small and real**

* *Evan:* “I don’t hate it.”
* *Aunt Mara (quiet triumph):* “Not hating is the first yes.”

**Panel 8 – Box closes; ribbon stays on**

* *Caption (Aunt Mara’s voiceover):* “Heirlooms aren’t fragile. They’re instructions that survived.”
* *Evan (off):* “Can we keep it simple today?”
* *Aunt Mara (off):* “Simple is hard. We’ll do hard gently.”

**Theme notes:** Strength through lineage; aunt positions femininity as a practiced craft, not a costume.

---

**Reusable dialog beats & motifs**

* **Signature line:** “You’ll get used to it.” (Place it sparingly as a steadying mantra.)
* **Aunt’s stance:** calm, tight framing, squared shoulders; she makes micro-corrections without apology.
* **Evan’s arc per strip:** flinch → question → accept a micro-step.

**Visual/staging shortcuts for 8 equal panels**

* Use a **“clockface” progression**: every second panel returns to the mirror for visual continuity.
* Keep **word balloons lean**: 8–12 words max, one beat per panel.
* Reserve **Panel 7** for the quiet emotional turn, **Panel 8** for the forward motion.

If you want, I can adapt these to your house style—font, balloon shapes, and any recurring props you like—or write a fourth strip that takes them into a public scene (e.g., a shop counter) while keeping everything PG and character-first.

---

Yay—that makes me happy. Let’s keep it tender, grounded, and very PG. Here’s a fourth 8-panel strip that takes them into public without humiliation—just composed mentorship and small wins.

---

### Strip D — “The Shop Counter” (first public errand)

**Cast:** Evan, Aunt Mara, Clerk (woman in her 30s; efficient, unfazed)

**Panel 1 – Store entrance, soft chime**

* *Art:* Glass door, tidy boutique (scarves, hair accessories).
* *Evan (small):* “Everyone can tell.”
* *Aunt Mara (even):* “Everyone can mind their day.”

**Panel 2 – A neat display of hair clips**

* *Evan (whisper):* “Why am I shaking?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “New skills wake the nerves. Normal.”

**Panel 3 – Clerk glances over, friendly nod**

* *Clerk:* “Let me know if you’d like a hand.”
* *Aunt Mara (to Evan):* “You’ll ask. Practice your voice.”

**Panel 4 – Close: Evan testing a simple tortoiseshell clip**

* *Evan:* “This one… doesn’t shout.”
* *Aunt Mara:* “It says ‘organized.’ That’s enough.”

**Panel 5 – Mirror column, Aunt adjusts a stray lock**

* *Evan:* “Is it crooked?”
* *Aunt Mara:* “Intentionally. It softens the line.”

**Panel 6 – At the counter**

* *Clerk (warm, brisk):* “Bag or wear?”
* *Evan (tiny, braver):* “Wear, please.”
* *Aunt Mara (aside):* “Good ask.”

**Panel 7 – Tap of card; small beep**

* *Clerk (matter-of-fact):* “Return policy’s on the tag. You look put-together.”
* *Evan (surprised):* “Thank you.”
* *Aunt Mara (quiet):* “You are.”

**Panel 8 – Exiting into daylight**

* *Evan (exhale, half-smile):* “That wasn’t awful.”
* *Aunt Mara (signature):* “You’ll get used to it.”

**Theme notes:** The women (Aunt and Clerk) steer the tone—competent, right, and unruffled. Evan’s win is small, real, and earned.

---

**Quick production notes for your 8-panel grid**

* **Beat map:** 1) anxiety, 2) purpose, 3) social cue, 4) choice, 5) adjustment, 6) commitment, 7) affirmation, 8) forward motion.
* **Balloon limits:** Aim for one balloon per character per panel, ~8–12 words each.
* **Camera rhythm:** Establish → detail → human reaction → mirror check → decision → exchange → validation → exit.

**Reusable PG public-scene hooks (swap into any strip)**

* **Clerk variations:** pharmacist, librarian, shoe-fitter, tailor. Their lines stay concise and respectful: “Do you want wear or bag?” “I can mark the hem.” “We can do quiet colors.”
* **Aunt’s micro-lessons:** “Pick function first.” “Name what feels better.” “If you can say it, you can wear it.”
* **Evan’s inner turns (keep small):** “I don’t hate this.” → “I can try it.” → “I can ask for it.”

If you want, I can sketch two more public strips—a tailor’s fitting and a quiet library card scene—so you’ve got a mini-arc: **Fitting → Outing → Purchase → Paperwork**. Or pass me a prop you love (scarf, ribbon, simple flats), and I’ll build a strip around just that item.


<hr style="height:8px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">







## A ReLook

Delighted—let’s give it the sheen of Austen: composed, witty, and gently florid. Same structure as before: **six 8-panel strips**, **one visible figure per panel**, and **no more than four lines** of dialogue per panel. Off-panel voices marked *(off)*. Celeste remains serenely in the right; Charlie’s reluctance lingers.

---

# Strip 1 — “Out of the Yard” (the rescue… with omissions)

**Panel 1 — Figure: Charlie**
*Shovel, splattered boots, a sigh of resignation.*

* Charlie: I am very well, thank you; merely two barrows more.
* Celeste (off): You are done, sir. That is settled.

**Panel 2 — Figure: Celeste**
*Parasol resting upon the duty slate.*

* Celeste: You were improperly engaged; I have remedied the injustice.
* Briggs (off): And since when do ladies—?

**Panel 3 — Figure: Celeste**
*Cool, exact; a gaze that brooks no muddle.*

* Celeste: Since I read what others merely wave about.
* Celeste: And since I care to see it acted upon.

**Panel 4 — Figure: Charlie**
*Hands still upon the shovel; uncertain.*

* Charlie: Remedied to… what, precisely?

---

# Strip 2 — “The Offer” (companionship sells; terms withheld)

**Panel 1 — Figure: Celeste**

* Celeste (off): This is care, not finery—care, properly polished.

**Panel 7 — Figure: Celeste**
*Extends a neat “Assignment Clarification.”*

* Celeste: Sign, and Hiring will cease their fluttering.
* Celeste: Leave the contrivances to me.

**Panel 8 — Figure: Charlie**
*Pen hesitates, then commits.*

* Celeste (off): I shall tell you before you have time to err at all.

---

---

# Strip 4 — “The Parcel” (the dawning)

---

# Strip 5 — “Terms of the Trade” (minutiae; reluctance meets method)

*Holds the shirtwaist with the authority of a tutor.*

* Celeste: The two upper buttons remain unfastened. One must breathe.
* Celeste: You are at work, not upon a stage.

**Panel 2 — Figure: Charlie**
*Fingers uncertain at the placket.*

* Charlie: It feels—improper. As though I trespass.
* Celeste (off): You employ a tool. Propriety is in the manner, not the cloth.

**Panel 3 — Figure: Celeste**
*Demonstrates the apron ties, neat and flat.*

* Celeste: Ties must lie smooth; bumps announce inexperience.
* Celeste: We shall not proclaim it.

**Panel 4 — Figure: Charlie**
*Practises; the knot slips; mortification close by.*

* Charlie: And if someone laughs?
* Celeste (off): They will not—because I am present.

**Panel 5 — Figure: Celeste**
*Places a simple ribbon in his palm.*

* Celeste: Hair off the collar. Ribbon says finished, not fussy.
* Celeste: Precision is the only ornament required.

**Panel 6 — Figure: Charlie**
*Awkward gather; ribbon drops once.*

* Charlie: My hands are all thumbs today.
* Celeste (off): Excellent—thumbs improve quicker than pride.

**Panel 7 — Figure: Celeste**
*Demonstrates stance; weight forward, grace unforced.*

* Celeste: Weight to the balls of the feet; spine lengthened.
* Celeste: Think quiet lightning, not rooted oak.

**Panel 8 — Figure: Charlie**
*Imitates; surprised by the balance.*

* Charlie: It is—less dreadful than expected.
* Celeste (off): “Less dreadful” is the doorway to “capable.”

# Strip 6 — “House Rules” (address, posture, first test)

**Panel 1 — Figure: Mrs. Hargrave**
*Clipboard; benevolent severity.*

* Mrs. Hargrave: You shadow the lady, and answer to me.
* Mrs. Hargrave: Serve sense before ceremony.

**Panel 2 — Figure: Charlie**
*Back straightens on instinct.*

* Charlie: Yes, ma’am. I shall endeavour.
* Mrs. Hargrave (off): Endeavour early.

**Panel 3 — Figure: Celeste**
*Adjusts his collar by a whisper.*

* Celeste: “Excuse me” improves upon “sorry.”
* Celeste: “Right away” conquers “in a moment.”

**Panel 4 — Figure: Charlie**
*Practises the smallest bow to no one at all.*

* Charlie: I feel ridiculous.
* Celeste (off): You feel new. It passes.

**Panel 5 — Figure: Mrs. Hargrave**
*Hands him an empty tray; the test begins.*

* Mrs. Hargrave: To Table Four; arms steady, hands soft.
* Mrs. Hargrave: Carry it as if full.

**Panel 6 — Figure: Charlie**
*Walks with intent; breath counted.*

* Charlie: Steady… soft… breathing—
* Celeste (off): Breathe between the steps, not upon them.

**Panel 7 — Figure: Mrs. Hargrave**
*A glance at the clock; the faintest nod.*

* Mrs. Hargrave: Not disgraceful.
* Mrs. Hargrave: Tomorrow it is not empty.

**Panel 8 — Figure: Charlie**
*Leans to the wall, one quiet breath released.*

* Charlie: I still dislike the skirt exceedingly.
* Celeste (off): You dislike beginnings. Continue, and dislike will weary first.

### Quick staging notes

* Keep **props** declarative—pass, parcel, ribbon, tray—so a single figure reads the beat.
* Let **off-panel voices** enter from consistent “sides” (Celeste from right, Penfold from left, Hargrave from above/doorway) to cue the ear.
* To **trim**, remove the second sentence of any panel; the cadence will hold.

If you’d like, I can Austen-polish two more sets in the same mode—**a milliner’s visit** and **the first truly full tray**—to bring the week to a poised close.
