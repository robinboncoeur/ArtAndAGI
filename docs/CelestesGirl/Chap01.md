I shouldn’t have been in that corridor at all.

The library wing had its own hush — pale tiles, the faint perfume of hand soap drifting from the bathrooms, and that institutional quiet that makes you lower your voice without thinking. I’d cut through to avoid the main hall after the bell, because the hallway was a river of elbows and backpacks and I don’t like being jostled when my head is full.

And because I’d learned early that if you walk as though you belong somewhere, people stop asking why you’re there. It isn’t arrogance. It’s choreography.

I nudged the door with my shoulder and stepped into the girls’ toilets — and only then saw someone at the sinks.

For a beat my mind stalled, not because it was scandalous, but because it didn’t fit the neat categories school insisted were natural.

A boy stood under the mirror lights with a paper towel clutched in one hand. Slight. Narrow-shouldered. Long brownish hair that fell into his eyes as if he’d forgotten it needed managing. His uniform shirt was oversized and softened by too many washes, the collar gone limp like the person laundering it had stopped believing in crispness.

He wasn’t predatory still. He wasn’t defiant still.

He was… caught. Like a deer that has realised the world contains headlights.

He stared at me.

Not the usual quick look you get from boys who think girls are scenery. This was different — his breath snagged and didn’t restart smoothly; his gaze locked as if his eyes had forgotten they were supposed to move. Not bravado. Not lust. Just a raw, helpless kind of astonishment.

That sort of attention can turn ugly in the wrong hands.

In the right hands, it’s simply something you have to handle carefully.

I could have shouted *Get out*, as if volume was a form of safety. But screaming makes you the story. It invites witnesses, gossip, morality plays. And I didn’t want a story. Not for me, and not for him.

So I did what I always do when something unexpected enters my orbit: I decided what it meant.

“Hello,” I said, calm as if I’d found a first-year hiding from a duty teacher. “Are you lost?”

His throat bobbed. The silence was so complete I could hear the air-conditioning tick behind the vent. Then he managed, hoarse and thin, “I… I’m sorry.”

A pre-emptive apology. Interesting.

I softened my voice by a fraction — not pity. Calibration. “You know you’re in the ladies’, right?”

I watched the fact land late. His eyes flicked around the room, taking in the sinks, the cubicle doors, the absence of any familiar marker that could make this make sense. He swallowed hard.

“Oh—” He groaned. “Oh, no. I thought this was— I mean, I—”

Words spilled out, urgent and unhelpful. The instinct to explain, to erase himself by being reasonable.

He wasn’t the swaggering kind of boy. He wasn’t even the cheeky kind. He was the wrong-door, head-in-the-clouds kind — the kind who would apologise to a chair he bumped into.

He stood there with the paper towel like it was evidence.

I took a small step nearer — close enough to anchor him, not close enough to crowd. He backed into the sinks without meaning to, shoulders drawing inward as if he could shrink out of existence.

“Alright,” I said, brisk. “Stop. Breathe.”

He blinked at me, startled by the instruction. Then — because he didn’t seem able to help it — he did it.

“Good,” I said, as if he’d complied on purpose. “Now. You’re going to walk out like nothing happened.”

His mouth opened again. I lifted a finger. Not harsh. Simply: *I’m handling this.*

“Don’t argue. Don’t confess. Don’t do that thing where you look like you’re asking to be punished.” His shoulders tightened, like I’d hit a nerve. “Just… let me steer for a second.”

He stared at me.

And then I saw the shift — tiny, but unmistakable. His breath slowed. His spine uncurled a fraction. His hands lowered.

He absorbed my taking over like cloth absorbs dye. It wasn’t weakness. It was habit — a boy who’d learned somewhere that his safest option was to yield.

That’s a habit you can ruin a person with, if you’re careless.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

He hesitated, as though names were dangerous.

“Chuck,” he said, then corrected himself with an awkward, desperate politeness. “Charles. Charles Rossignol.”

“Rossignol,” I repeated, tasting it. “Nightingale.”

His eyes lifted, startled that I knew it meant something — and what it meant. He held my gaze for a beat too long, still caught, still dazzled, and I felt the weight of it. Not flattering. Not comfortable. Just… a responsibility.

“Right then,” I said, and tilted my head toward the door. “We’re leaving.”

He looked past me as if the corridor might bite. I stepped first, so he didn’t have to. I positioned myself where anyone glancing up would see *me* before they saw him.

“If someone looks at you oddly,” I said quietly, “you look at me. Understand?”

He nodded — quick, obedient.

We moved.

At the threshold he stopped, hand on the handle, eyes flicking back to me with an expression I recognised too well: expecting the world to change its mind.

I lifted my eyebrows.

Go on.

He swallowed and opened the door.

“Charlie,” I said, lightly, as he stepped through.

He froze. “My name’s not—”

“I know,” I said, and let a hint of humour take the edge off it. “But it suits you. Tell me if you hate it.”

He looked at me as if I’d handed him something he didn’t know how to hold.

Then he was gone — swallowed by the tide of students.

I stayed in the bright tiled room long enough to wash my hands, because habits matter even when your afternoon takes a sharp left. As the dryer hummed, I thought — not unkindly, but with the clean satisfaction of a strategist whose board has presented an unexpected piece:

He watches my face like he’s waiting to be told what’s real.

I’m very good at that.

I have to be careful with it.
