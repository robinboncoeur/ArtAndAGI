    <p>He was pulling paper towels, when he heard her voice and quickly turned around. There she was: the prettiest girl he’d ever seen, honestly. Not in a magazine-cover way, not generically pretty... a make-your-heart-beat-faster kind of pretty.</p>
    <p>Her face was, well, flawless, and it shone with a smile that was both curious and... just a bit mischievous, like she knew something you didn't, and was enjoying the knowledge immensely. She looked to be maybe a year or two older, certainly taller than him. She stood like a ballerina, but one who spent considerable time observing people. Her Charlotte Rampling eyes held you with that unsettling, penetrating gaze.</p> 
    <p>That self-assurance was so complete, it made the fact of her being in the men’s restroom seem like a calculated choice, like she was making a point. You wouldn’t question it.</p>
  </div>

“Hello... girl?” 

The words fell into an awkward silence. She mercifully shortened it.

"You... ARE a girl. Aren't you?"

The thought that she might be the one who was misplaced didn’t even register initially. Not even a flicker. He was too busy trying to process the fact that this... this stunning girl was actually looking at him, talking to him. She was talking to him. To him! And that, at that moment, it was all he could parse, even if it was - or perhaps, **because** it was - so unbelieveable. The restroom, the potential for awkwardness... none of it mattered. Just this. Her. Talking. To him.

Her question seemed… vaguely odd, yes. Like he’d somehow missed a crucial piece of information, a plot point he’d slept through. It was the kind of oddness that suggested a larger, looming *something*. He felt a growing uneasiness.

He managed, cautiously, “No, I’m… I’m a guy.”

The girl’s smile seemed oddly sympathetic, as if at an admission of a shortcoming, a defect. “Oh, sorry. It’s just that  you’re about the same height as some of my friends. And, to be honest, you’re not **built** like a bloke, at least, none that I know.” He was so completely, ridiculously charmed by her accent — that lovely, rolling British thing — that he honestly would have basked in her words even if she'd been actively, aggressively insulting him. Probably would have just nodded, as he did now. “Plus, well... you’re in the ladies’." Another pause. "Um, you know, the girl's toilet.”

Reality suddenly hit. He stared at her for a moment, eyes wide in horror, then glanced quickly around him. Sure enough, no urinals. The colour drained from his face.

“Oh - sh... dear! I’m so, so sorry! I... uh, I can’t believe I...”

He wasn’t the dangerous kind of boy. He was the wrong-door, head-in-the-clouds kind: hair in his eyes, oversized shirt with a slept-in collar.

She could have said: 'get out'. Instead she felt the oddest impulse of charity: perhaps it was curiosity, but more than that, pity. She moved a half step closer. His head tilted up, and then she saw them: those almond-shaped doe eyes with long thick lashes. Far from being a threat, he was a lost lamb that had wandered in and needed shepherding.

Her smile broadened, a twinkle in her eye. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone if you don’t.” She peered at him with a slight tilt of her head, curiosity growing. Charlie found himself backed into the sinks. What was she going to do? He had invaded a sacred space for women.

At least she wasn't screaming.

She gazed at him for what seemed an awkward eternity, then precipitously extended her hand.

        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

“I'm Celeste. Celeste Shelley.”

Not only was she not screaming, she was introducing herself. He looked at her hand the way a child looks at a violin up close the first time: reverence mixed with the concern as to its fragility. Then he put his palm in hers.

“Um, I’m Chuck, um, Charles Rossignol,” he finally croaked as her hand firmly grasped his. Celeste’s hand was soft, but its grip surprisingly tenacious.

“Chuck. Charles. Hmmm," she mused, studying his hand. The bones were fine, the fingers long and slight, the skin cool. A girl’s hand, if that were possible, only partly because of weakness but more of the way it settled in her own without weight, of a delicate refinement out of character with the rest of the person.

"'Chuck' doesn't really suit you.” Her grin pinched into a thoughtful grimace. “‘Rossignol’... that’s French for a kind of bird... the *nightingale*?” Charlie's heart pounded in his ears as he stared at her hand gripping his, not really taking in what she was saying.

“‘Bird’... that’s a term some blokes back home use for ‘girl’.”

Her eyes finally met his looking up at her imploringly. 

“Oh! Sorry,” she gushed, releasing his hand, a blush rising on her cheeks. “I didn’t mean to...” She grinned. “I make you a bit nervous, don't I?”

Her smile, her accent, her smell. Her grip: he was spellbound. "Uh... yeah, I mean, no..." Dry-mouthed, tentatively he tried to explain. "Well, it's just that, well, I probably shouldn’t be in here.”

“Quite right,” she said wryly with a short chuckle. “I reckon I’d feel a bit awkward in the gents’ myself.”

Charlie turned to go. He was forcing himself, as if his feet had decided they were quite content to remain precisely where they were.

Celeste gently lifted her eyebrows and nodded. It felt less like an command and more like a slightly amused dismissal. He moved numbly towards the door, as if being nudged forward. As he pulled open the door, he risked one last glance back, and his stomach did a little flip — the one you get on a roller coaster, or when someone unexpectedly touches your arm.

She was smiling. At him.

“See you, Charlie.”

By the time Charlie entered the cool quiet of the library a dizzying lightness enveloped his being.

He had just met an angel.

### Again, With Feeling

Celeste stared unseeing at the notes on the page: it was the part for the english horn she had been practicing for the past month. Around her, student orchestra musicians were readying their instruments as they chatted. Some were practicing those difficult bars. Celeste wondered about those bits: she had already mastered her part. 

The conductor / instructor took her place on the podium. 

"As you know, we're going to try that new piece today. You've all been practicing it for the past month... it's for english horn and strings," she said. "Horns, the rest of you woodwinds, the rest of the class, just pay attention to how this is put together."

Celeste was a bit puzzled: her part wasn't anything complex. She'd performed more demanding parts on her clarinet. She shrugged as the conductor raised her arms. Second beat after the downbeat, she began playing.

A very assertive melody filled the chamber. The strings joined the english horn, tentatively, almost a bit disjointedly at first... but 'correcting'  themselves as her instrument continued to set the stage. Little by little, the strings harmonised with the english horn: first the violas, then the second violins, followed by 'cellos and first violins. The members of the class who were not playing were staring at Celeste: to them it was she—and not the conductor—who was pulling the piece together.

The little serenade had three parts... the middle was dance-like, almost like a pas-de-deux, carried by a solo violin, with the rest of the strings playing in soft pizzicato. Almost at the end of that section, there was an odd moment of dissonance, which the english horn confidently swept aside with its original melody. When the piece concluded, the orchestra and conductor sat and stood in silence, speechless. Celeste stared unseeing at the page before her.

They played it again. Celeste pushed the dynamics this time - being in a 'star' role suited her perfectly - and the serenade took on a vibrance, a poignancy that raised the hair on the conductor's neck. Again, piece done, silence. They played it again. It wasn't a difficult piece to perform... they were not playing it over and over to perfect their technique. It was the piece itself.

When the hour was up, Celeste left with the piece playing in her head in a loop.

In chemistry, Lauren gave her friend a quizzical second look.

"What's up with you, girl?"

Celeste grimaced. "You know that piece I've been practicing on my english horn?"

"I thought you played the clarnet."

"I *told* you, Miss Duncan had *given*—well, more like, loaned—me her english horn. It was to play specifically this piece we played today."

Lauren shrugged. Orchestral stuff didn't 'float her boat'. "Oh yeah... sorry, I forgot. So, why the weird vibes? Didn't go well?"

Celeste turned to her friend, fixing her with an intense gaze. She seemed to be searching for words.

"Lauren, it was unreal," she finally managed through dry lips. "I can still hear the whole thing in my head... I think we only played it three of four times, but it's all... right there!" She pointed to her head, her eyes wide.

Lauren smiled uneasily. "So, um, what sort of piece was it?" she asked cautiously, as if opening a can of expired beans. She feared a long exposition couched in music theory terms.

"It was... bewitching."

"Bewitching."

Celeste appeared to 'give her head a wobble'. "I know, I'm not making any sense. Look, I've been practicing this piece for the past month or so - it's not a hard piece to play. But today was like, well we heard the whole thing for the first time... all the instruments, the strings, and my english horn. I'm telling you, the whole class was blown away. Including the teacher!"

"Really. Cool." Lauren gave her customary not-excited-about-this look.

"Lauren, you would literally have to hear it. I know you're not into classical stuff..."

"But... do I hear a 'but'?" Lauren cleared her throat. "yeah, nah... doesn't do it for me, sorry—not if there's no lyrics." A change came over Celeste again. "What?"

"I don't even know who wrote it." She turned back to her retorts and beaker. "gotta ask Ms Duncan," she muttered, mostly to herself.

It wasn't until Friday that she got her answer, and in a rather unexpected way. She went to the music building early that morning in hopes of catching Miss Duncan in her office. The hallways were empty: someone was banging away in a piano room on a piano badly needing tuning. 

"Celeste?" She turned to see Miss Duncan unlocking her office.

"Good morning... I won't keep you long. Just have a quick question." Miss Duncan raised her eyebrows expectantly. "Um, who wrote that piece we played on Wednesday?"

"He's a junior, here. A quiet kid... nice enough, but is sadly neglecting the rest of his studies." She paused, biting her lip. "Probably shouldn't have said that. It's just that, well, between you and me, he's a genius! That piece..."

"I know, right?" Celeste's eyes shone. "What's his name?"

"Chuck."

### Quest



They’d talked her into it like it was nothing—“Ever thought of oboe? English horn?”—as if a reed tied with thread and nerve were just another mouthpiece you clicked in. Celeste, who loved a challenge almost as much as she loved being good at something, said yes. Then came the ritual: the jam jar of water for soaking reeds; the reed knife that was more scalpel than tool; the long tones that tasted of cane and patience. For weeks she left faint bruises at the corners of her mouth and learned the politics of breath. Control wasn’t a mood; it was a daily practice.

Now she sat under the harsh rehearsal lights with the **English horn**—**cor anglais** if you were feeling fancy—resting in the cradle of her right thumb, the bell against her knee as if the instrument were listening for footsteps through the floor.

The conductor gave the downbeat; the strings laid a velvet pad; two horns leaned a third apart and turned the air warm. At letter **A**, he looked at her. “English horn, please.”

She brought the reed to her lip and let the note bloom, not forced, not shy—**dolce**, mezzo voce, the human voice told through wood and wire. The line was considerate in that way only a good ear writes: it knew where breath lived, where the room inhaled with you. She could feel the orchestra wake—violas with their heads lifted, second violins stilled into a single spine, flutes unconsciously quieting so as not to spill light where shadow was wanted. The conductor’s eyebrows climbed a fraction. Not flattery. Recognition.

The phrase stepped once over a small canyon and landed sure-footed. She didn’t push vibrato; she let it arrive like a confession, then leave. The hall that wasn’t a hall (only the ugly rehearsal room with the scuffed risers) seemed for a moment to forget itself.

“Again from A,” the conductor said, quick, hungry. “And strings, give me room. This voice is the thing.”

She played it better. She played it as if she had been born to this colour, this melancholy that wasn’t sad so much as truthful. For the first time since the restroom incident, she didn’t think of the wrong-door boy; she thought only of the line that had been written by someone who understood breath and refused to crowd it.

They reached **B**; the harmony rocked like a boat that knows the river. The piece—**a student piece**, someone had scoffed earlier—did the one unforgivable thing: it made them care. When the cadence resolved, no one spoke at first, as if speech would scuff it.

Then the room exhaled, as a single animal.

The conductor lowered his arms slowly, the way you lower your hands from a hot kettle you’ve realised is bearable. “Whoever wrote this,” he said, half to himself, “listens.” He found Celeste’s eyes. “Again, and clarinets—no embroidery. Let the English horn tell the truth and you behave.”

She allowed herself the smallest smile—**not** pride; relief. The hours in her room, the reed-scraping until the shaving curled just so, the stubborn long tones that had felt like punishment until they didn’t—none of it had been theatre. The music knew her now. Or she knew it. It was difficult to say which, and that was the point.

At break she kept the instrument in her lap and the reed in its tiny coffin, as if either might run away. The conductor was bent over the score, making patient, tight pencilled marks. She went to him and stood in that polite, British way that means, *I’m waiting, but not asking twice*.

“Sir,” she said, soft enough to be private, clear enough to be irrevocable. “Who’s the composer?”

He glanced up, smiled without humour. “A student.”

“Yes,” she said, and did not blink. “Which one?”

He tapped the cover of the score with the end of his pencil, as if that would conjure a name he was not yet ready to share. “You’ll meet them. Let’s get it roadworthy first.”

It should have satisfied her. It didn’t. Something in her had already moved furniture to make space for a new thing. She wasn’t looking for a person to be dazzled by; she wanted the mind that had written those breaths and those shy, perfect cadences. She wanted to have a conversation with that mind, on paper first, then in air.

“Right,” she said, unbothered on the surface, burning underneath. “From me—one small request. At B: I’d like a written breath before the leap. It will sing better.”

He made the mark without argument. “You’re not wrong.”

“Thank you.” She paused, then, because it mattered: “And whoever they are—tell them the English horn part is… considerate.” The word felt indecently intimate in her mouth. “It listens back.”

“High praise,” he said, amused. “I’ll pass it on.”

She returned to her chair, fitted the reed, and let the tip wet again, the way you give a plant a sip before moving it to a sunnier window. The others were watching her in the sideways way orchestras watch one another when something is suddenly real. She lifted the bell, counted the rests, and thought, with an odd, fierce tenderness, **I want to write like that.**

When the downbeat came, she was ready to be the voice again—until the voice could be hers from the ground up.

## Marie Claire?

On his way home from school, Charlie meandered past the bay into the park. The cool afternoon breeze from the bay blended sea fragrance with the familiar smell of decaying fish remains and mangroves. The grasses of the park had enjoyed a trimming, leaving that delicious scent of fresh-mown grass. One lone seagull glided over the wind-swept, grey water. There was another smell, one that would have invoked the question whether it was going to rain if Charlie had been there with someone. But he wasn't, he was alone. As per usual.

“**I shall see you soon, Charlie.**”

Did that actually happen?

A brief blush crossed his face. *Okay, so the ladies’ restroom isn’t the ideal place to meet new people*. 

How could he have wandered in there by mistake? And the shock, the abject horror of being in a *sacred place*, in a woman's place, a place he absolutely should **not** have been - the consequences of being found there could have been catastrophic - ...and so as his ruminations escalated, his imagination ran away with him. At emotionally intense times, music took over his consciousness... Ralph Vaughan Williams' Norfolk Rhapsody thundered in his head. It offered no solace, but magnified his anxiety.

Charlie took in a breath as he watched the seagull swooped back and finally land on top of a piling, flawlessly. No incident. No being hauled off to the authorities to explain himself for a moment of absent-mindedness. He slowed his breathing... he began to feel calm, once again.

And there was no incident because... Celeste.

Well, so much for feeling calm. That whole ill-advised detour into the girls’ bathroom — the ensuing embarrassment, the flailing attempts at explanation — it all sort of... faded. Like background noise. What stuck, what lingered in a way that felt almost unsettling, was the sheer effect she had. It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-style shift, not exactly. More like a subtle tilting of the world. Suddenly, things felt unsteady. He was grasping for something solid, something familiar, and finding nothing. It was as if she’d loosened the docklines without telling him, and he was now adrift. He couldn’t stop thinking about her, which felt both ridiculous and inevitable. The remote possibility of actually seeing her again — just even the *thought* of it — produced a peculiar mix of thrill and low-grade panic. Her look... it was intoxicating, certainly. But also, undeniably, a little frightening.

“**I shall see you soon**.”

The first drops of rain felt cool on his skin as he opened the mailbox. The sky was heavy with bruised-looking clouds you get right before a proper downpour. He pulled out the magazine — some glossy thing of his aunt's. The thought occurred to him, with a familiar weariness, that girls didn’t generally gravitate toward skinny runts. ‘Nigel NoFriends’ types. Basically, guys like him. It wasn’t exactly a revelation — he’d been aware of this for years, really — but somehow, today, that notion's pinch was sharper. Like a cold-shoulder reality check. He darted for the porch. Slipping the key into the lock, he was startled by a voice directly behind him.

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-FDoor1.jpg" alt="Swimming" style="float: right; width: 350px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

"Hello, girl!"

He whirled around, startled. Celeste. She was standing just behind him on the porch, appearing as suddenly as the rain. He blinked, a little disoriented. *How had she gotten here*? He hadn’t heard a thing.

“Oh, hi Celeste!” he finally managed to stammer. His mind raced for something clever to say. “Do you live around here?”

Fail! *Of course she lives around here — what kind of question was that*? Celeste’s grin widened.

“Yeah, I’m just a couple of doors down,” she replied casually, her eyes drifting towards the magazine in his hand. "Is that Marie Claire?"

Charlie's stomach dropped — a women’s fashion magazine. Nervelessly, he handed the magazine to Celeste.

“Marie Claire! I’m impressed, Charlie!” Celeste said, her voice alight with enthusiasm. “Great choice.”

Did she think it was his subscription? “Yeah, well, uh, actually, my aunt, um...” he mumbled, his ears burning.

“Oh.” Her face fell with a flicker of disappointment. réunissez

*Wait, what? Why might Celeste think he’d be subscribing to Marie Claire? And even more puzzling, why did she seem disappointed to learn he wasn’t*? The whole thing made his head spin. These were murky waters: murky, and rather deep.

“Celeste, um...” He swallowed, clutching at anything that might smooth the moment over. “Wanna have a look? At the magazine, I mean,” he added, his face reddening.

“What, here on the porch?” She tilted her head innocently.

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Kitch1.jpg" alt="Shake hands" style="float: left; width: 350px;
        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

“No-no! I meant, would you like to come in?" In the back of his mind something threw a 'red danger flag', but he was trying so hard to be a good host as well as not be seen as a complete loser that he completely ignored it." I mean, please come in. I’m sure my aunt wouldn’t mind. I mean, for you to read her magazine.” He was yapping and he knew it. He tried desperately to keep his voice steady but his red face gave it away.

Celeste studied him carefully, biting her lower lip to suppress a smile. 

"Are you sure it’s alright? I shouldn’t want to upset your aunt."

They went into the kitchen. Charlie offered Celeste a soft drink but she declined, asking for a glass of water instead.

“Water is better for the skin,” she explained.

“I—um—didn’t realise…” he mumbled as he put the unopened can back in the fridge. Behind him, Celeste pursed her lips with an approving, amused moue.

“So, Charlie, what do you do for fun?”

“For fun? Um, well, I sort-of write music,” he replied shyly.

“Really! What, like pop songs? Or jazz?”

“No. Actually, um, more like, sort-of classical. Like, for orchestra.”

“*Really!* Please show me.”

He gulped. “Hang on... I’ll just get my laptop.”

## What is Misogyny?

        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
        
He darted to his room to retrieve his laptop from the desk. It wasn’t until he turned back that he realised Celeste had followed him to his room. Her approach had been so silent her presence in the room startled him: she’d moved like an owl gliding noiselessly in the night. She casually settled herself cross-legged on his bed, leaning back slightly with her hands behind her, her demeanour as relaxed as if she were in her own room. Her sharp eyes swept over the decor—a vase of silk flowers on the bedside table, framed floral prints adorning the walls, and a bedspread resplendent with pastel blossoms.

“Nice room!” Her eyes swept across the space. “Love the, um, delicate touches. Did you decorate it yourself?”

Charlie shook his head, the heat rising to his cheeks once again. “Auntie got this bedspread when she got hers, so she decided to make my room a bit more to her liking. The pictures are her idea too. She says they bring positive vibes or something.”

Celeste tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a soft, skeptical smile. “Positive vibes,” she murmured, her tone light but carrying a note of amusement. She had crossed her legs on the bed, the skirt of her dress riding up just enough to reveal a glimpse of white. Charlie’s breath hitched—he didn’t know where to look. His gaze flickered downward and back up again, guilt and confusion flitting across his features. His head spun.
Was she aware? She was studying him with that inscrutable smile—a warm, gentle, almost sympathetic smile—but there was something else in that calm confidence, the angle of her neck, the way she tilted her head, that made him feel oddly vulnerable. She was so sure of herself, so entirely at ease, while he felt like he was fumbling along.

She leaned back slightly, still perched on the bed, her eyes lingering on him for a moment longer than felt natural. Her smile deepened—just a little. Was she trying to reassure him? Why did that fact—that she was trying to reassure him—unsettle him instead?

She quietly held out the plastic-wrapped magazine.

“Plastic covers… I so hate plastic. Could you—”

  <div class="columnB">
    He cut into the edge of the plastic wrapping with his nails and pulled it off. As he handed the magazine back to her, she unexpectedly grasped his hand and pulled him to sit on the bed beside her.<br>
    <br>
    “You’ve got *lovely* nails, Charles,” she said with an approving smile. “I know plenty of girls who’d be absolutely jealous of those.” She paused, her gaze steady and searching. “But of course you are **definitely** not a girl." She paused, pursing her lips, staring at him intently.<br>
    <br>
    Then, with just a hint of sarcasm: "Right!”
  </div>
</div>

He floundered in a sea of confusion: he wanted her to like him, but instinctively balked at any reference to feminine attributes, no matter how positive she might have considered them.

Charlie blushed. “No, I’m... I mean,” he mumbled. “I used to bite my nails as a kid. My aunt has been putting something on them so I wouldn’t.”

“I see. Well, they look truly lovely.”

Charlie quickly flipped his laptop open to cover his confusion. As the notation software loaded, he couldn’t help but notice out of the corner of his eye that she wasn’t looking at the screen at all but was studying him intently. When a violin concerto finally loaded and he played it, she showed a genuine interest.

“You wrote this?”

He shook his head.

“No, I’m *studying* it. It’s a violin concerto by Miclos Rozsa. It was in the movie ‘The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes’.” There was pride in his voice. “I’m a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes!”

“Why?”

He glanced at her, alarmed at her sudden cold tone of voice.

“Um, what do you mean?”

“Well, if the book is anything like the TV series then Sherlock was a misogynist.”

“A what?”

“He didn’t like women.” She grimaced, her gaze even more intense. “Do you like women?”

Charlie gulped. “What do you mean? Of *course* I like women, Celeste!”

“So, what is it about Holmes you find appealing?” she pressed.

“His, um, brain. His intelligence. His ability to see clues where others see nothing.”

“I see.” A fleeting smile crossed her lips. “Is that what made you decide to take algebra?”

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Bedr1.jpg" alt="Swimming" style="float: right; width: 350px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Charlie reddened, and dropped his gaze.

“I thought I had to take a math subject.”

He felt her hand slide over his and looked at her face in surprise. Her regard was full of concern. 

“You struggle with math, don’t you, *Sharl*?” 

There was no point in denying it. Charlie nodded, completely oblivious to how she'd mispronounced his name.

“You know, I could help you a bit with if you’d like,” she suggested gently.

Charlie looked at her despondently. “You would be wasting your time. Mrs Kielley thinks I’m hopeless. She reckons I should stick to remedial maths.” Which wasn't true: his teacher was convinced Charles was bright enough. The problem was: he didn't believe her.

“Oh, I think you smarter than that,” Celeste declared brightly. “I think I could give you a few pointers that would make all the difference.”

“Really? What pointers?”

“What do you mean by that, Charlie? You don’t sound like you believe me.”

“No-no, I totally believe you, Celeste!” he countered urgently. “I just can’t believe you would, um like... even want to, um like... be here, um...”

“Oh, *Sharl*, now you’re being silly! Why wouldn’t I want to, you goose? I *am* actually here, aren’t I? You are not making any sense at all.” A suspicious look crossed her face, her brow furrowing as her eyes narrowed slightly and her tone turned sharper. “This is because I’m a girl, isn’t it? Go on, admit it. You don’t think girls are smart enough to be able to help you!”

“What? no!” Charlie retorted. “What does being a girl have to do with anything?” 

Celeste’s eyes drilled searchingly into his for a moment.

“Okay, so, what is it?”

Charlie looked unseeing at his hands. “I guess, I mean, I can’t figure out why you’d be interested in helping me.” He stopped, and looked at her questioningly. “Like, when... I um, ended up in the wrong restroom and you were so nice to me — even those I must have seemed such a hopeless case...” His voice trailed off.

“I decided then that I liked you.”

“You liked me?” His face registered complete disbelief.

“Yes, I **liked** you!” She shook her head, exasperated but amused. “Honestly, I’m not sure what’s so hard to grasp about that. Something about you said you were definitely not like any of the other blokes.” She paused for a moment. “Anyway, I asked Amanda about you — she had mentioned you’re in some of the same classes — and she said you were struggling with algebra.” She paused, watching his mouth fall open in astonishment. “That’s why I was in your class today.”

“Oh, I thought…”

“What? That I’m taking algebra? I’m a senior. I’m taking calculus.” His mouth formed an unspoken ‘o’. “You got called up after class, didn’t you, Charlie?” She grimaced slightly as she squeezed his hand. “What was that about?”

Charlie stared at the floor, shoulders slumped in defeat, and shrugged helplessly. Without a word, she shifted closer, the soft, floral notes of her perfume enveloping him. Her bouquet was calming, like her presence—a quiet, unspoken promise that she was there, that she would help. The scent lingered, subtly anchoring him to her, its warmth settling into his thoughts like a tether he didn’t realize he was holding onto.

“Believe me, I can help you, Charlie. And I want to. If you let me, I will!”

He stared at her, still incredulous.

She chortled. “I can read you like an open book, Charlie. Yes, you, Charl!” She lifted her chin with a hint of imperiousness. “I should warn you, though — I’m no pushover. I don’t take prisoners. If you want my help, you’d better be prepared to stick with it. And,” she added meaningfully, “there’s a catch to me teaching you. *Girl*.”

There it was again. The ‘girl’ thing. “Which is?”

“I'm not telling you now - you’ll find out soon enough, *Sharl*.” She rose. “Look, I should really go.” She swung her long hair over her shoulder and they headed for the front door, Charlie following her meekly.

“Thanks for coming over,” Charlie said earnestly. “I promise I’ll be a good student.”

She smiled — there was a hint of pity in that smile.

“You won’t have a choice, Charl.”

He held the door open as she stepped out, that uneasy feeling almost overwhelming him as she made her way down the sidewalk. “If you want, we can start anytime,” he called out after her. “I’m always here, um... anyway.” The desperation in his voice disgusted him but he was unable to stop babbling.
Celeste turned and waved. “I will let you know, Sharl.”

Did she just call me ‘Sharl’?

“By the way, don’t be a misogynist. Girls should not be misogynists.” With which Parthian shot she strode away, leaving him open-mouthed behind her.

Over dinner he thought he’d run the misogynist question by aunt Betty.

“Aunty, do you think I’m a... um, misogynist?”

Betty stared at him, puzzled.

“Misogynist? What a strange thing to ask, honey. Why in the world would you think that?”

Charlie cleared his throat.

“Well, I don’t, but this girl —”

“Girl?”

“Yeah, I met this girl in, um, well.” He blushed furiously.

“What! Out with it — where did you meet this girl?”

“I met her in the ladies restroom at the library yesterday,” Charlie whispered.
        
Betty’s mouth fell open. She stared at him in consternation.

“What in blue blazes were you doing in the ladies restroom, Charlie?!”

“I went in there by mistake, aunty! Really, I did! And this girl, she —”

“Go on.”

“Well, she asked me if I was a girl.”

“Well, at least she didn’t scratch your eyes out.” Betty’s frown melted slowly into a funny smirk. “What made her say that?” This girl sounded intriguing.

“She said it’s because my hair is almost as long as hers.”

“So? Nothing wrong with your hair!” Betty shot back, a protective edge to her voice. She had insisted he grow it out, imagining him as one of those dashing heroes from romance novels. It somehow hadn’t occurred to her that his smooth face, soft voice, and long locks might get him mistaken for a girl. “We’re not cutting it,” she added with finality and reached out to pat his hand. “Relax,” she said warmly. “You don’t look like a girl, Charles. Sure, your hair’s a little long, but it suits you. You’ve got great hair — don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”

“Anyway, I really didn’t think I’d ever see her again. Would have made sense—she probably thought I was some sort of freak, being in the ladies restroom and all.”

“Honey, don’t say things like that!”

Charlie shrugged. “So, I saw her again in algebra. And then, when I got home, well, there she was! She lives just down the street. Anyway, I invited her in —”

“You invited her in? Why?”

Charlie blushed. “Well, she saw the magazine — your Marie Claire — and thought it was mine. I told her that it was yours but that you probably wouldn’t mind if she had a look —”

“And you took it upon yourself to invite her in?” He cast his eyes downward at her look of disapproval. “That was a bit careless of you, wasn’t it?”

“She’s a girl!” Charlie retorted. “What is she going to do, rob me at gunpoint?”

“Don’t be silly, Charles. Girls can get up to all sorts of mischief. Maybe not as much as boys do, but it pays to be sensible. You need to be careful, honey.”

Charlie shrugged again. “Okay. Whatever. Anyway, we got to talking and I showed her what I was doing in Blender and we started talking about Sherlock Holmes. She asked me why I was so impressed by him. She said he was a misogynist: a guy who hates women.”

“I know what a misogynist is,” Betty said quietly. She sighed: she’d had plenty of personal experience with misogyny. “What’s your friend’s name?”

“Celeste. She’s, uh —” He paused, a bit embarrassed. Betty smiled knowingly.

“Pretty?”

“She is beyond beautiful,” Charlie replied fervently. “I just can’t figure out why she came here at all.”

“Maybe she likes you?”

“Auntie, she could have any guy she wants!”

She smiled at him. “Sounds like Celeste is a nice girl. I’m so glad you made a nice friend.” There was a warmth in her smile that carried a quiet assurance. “And no, I don’t think you have it in you to be a misogynist, darling.”

Celeste caught up with him just as he was leaving the school grounds the next day.

    “Mind if I walk with you?”<br><br>
    His heart pounding, he blushed.<br>
    “Sure! I mean, no. I mean: no, I don’t mind. Please do.”<br>
    They walked in silence for a while: Charlie couldn’t think of anything to say, and Celeste was enjoying the peace and quiet.<br>
    As they stopped at the bay, he caught her glancing at him from time to time. She seemed lost in thought. For a moment, the only sounds were the ocean waves in the distance and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Then, without warning, Celeste turned to him, her dark eyes locking on his with sudden intensity.<br><br>
    “Did you know that we all look like females in the first stages of our existence?”
  </div>

“What?” Charlie stared at her, incredulous.

“It’s true. Look it up if you don’t believe me. We all start out as female, in a way. I’m studying genetics — Mr Laudin, my biology teacher, has been giving us some extra assignments, and I wanted to understand chromosomes better. Apparently, until about seven weeks into development, you can’t tell the gender. We all resemble females at first.”

“You’re kidding!”

“Nope!” Celeste took his arm, guiding him as they walked. “But there’s more. You know men are genetically XY, right?”

“Yeah?”

“The Y chromosome is what makes males, well, male,” Celeste explained, her tone growing dramatic. “But — and this is the interesting bit — not all Y chromosomes are fully functional. In fact, in some people, very few are.”

Where the heck is she going with this?

They stopped suddenly. She drew close and stared at him. “Here’s the thing, Sharl,” she began, her tone deliberate. “There are plenty of reasons, like a missing or faulty Y chromosome, or something like androgen insensitivity syndrome, why someone might develop into a girl. The point is, ‘girl’ is the default human setting.”

Charlie felt a dizzying sensation of being caught in a whirlwind spinning him into a green jungle chasm. An arm encircling his waist kept him from being swallowed entirely by the chasm. He looked to see who held him so tightly by the waist.

It was Celeste.

She was the whirlwind. She was also holding him by the waist.
