  He was pulling paper towels when he heard a girl's voice and quickly turned around. She was the prettiest girl he’d ever seen, honestly. Not in a magazine-cover way, not generically pretty... a make-your-heart-beat-faster kind of pretty.

  Her face was, well, flawless, and it shone with a smile that was both curious and... just a bit mischievous, like she knew something you didn't, and was enjoying that knowledge. She looked to be maybe a year or two older, certainly taller than him. She stood like a ballerina, one who spent considerable time observing people. Her Charlotte Rampling eyes held you with that unsettling, penetrating gaze.

  That self-assurance was so complete, it made the fact of her being in the men’s restroom seem like a calculated choice, like she was making a point.  
  You wouldn’t question it.

“Hello ... girl?” 

The words fell into an awkward silence. She mercifully shortened it.

"You ... ARE a girl. Aren't you?"

The thought that she might be the one who was misplaced didn’t even register initially. Not even a flicker. He was too busy trying to process the fact that this ... this stunning girl was actually looking at him, *talking* to him. She was **talking** to him. To him! And that, at that moment, it was all he could process: it was so unbelieveable. The restroom, the potential for awkwardness ... none of it mattered. Just this. Her. *Talking*. To him.

Her question seemed… vaguely odd, yes. Like he’d somehow missed a crucial piece of information, a plot point he’d slept through. It was the kind of oddness that suggested a larger, looming *something*. He felt a growing uneasiness.

He managed, cautiously, “No, I’m ... I’m a guy.”

The girl’s smile seemed oddly sympathetic, as if at an admission of a shortcoming, a defect. “Oh, sorry. It’s just that  you’re about the same height as some of my friends. And, to be honest, you’re not **built** like a bloke, at least, none that I know.” He was so completely, ridiculously charmed by her accent — that lovely, rolling British thing — that he honestly would have basked in her words even if she'd been actively, aggressively insulting him. Probably would have just nodded, as he did now. “Plus, well ... you’re in the ladies’." Another pause. "Um, you know, the girl's toilet.”

Reality suddenly hit. He stared at her for a moment, eyes wide in horror, then glanced quickly around him. Sure enough, no urinals. The colour drained from his face.

“Oh - sh... dear! I’m so, so sorry! I ... uh, I can’t believe I—”

He wasn’t the dangerous kind of boy. He was the wrong-door, head-in-the-clouds kind: hair in his eyes, oversized shirt with a slept-in collar.

She could have said: 'get out'. Instead she felt the oddest impulse of charity: perhaps it was curiosity, but more than that, pity. She moved a half step closer. His head tilted up, and then she saw them: those almond-shaped doe eyes with long thick lashes. Far from being a threat, he was a lost lamb that had wandered in and needed shepherding.

Her smile broadened, a twinkle in her eye. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone if you don’t.” She peered at him with a slight tilt of her head, curiosity growing. Charlie found himself backed into the sinks. What was she going to do? He had invaded a sacred space for women.

At least she wasn't screaming.

She gazed at him for what seemed an awkward eternity, then precipitously extended her hand.

“I'm Celeste. Celeste Shelley.”

Not only was she not screaming, she was introducing herself. He looked at her hand the way a child looks at a violin up close the first time: reverence mixed with the concern as to its fragility. Then he put his palm in hers.

“Um, I’m Chuck, um, Charles Rossignol,” he finally croaked as her hand firmly grasped his. Celeste’s hand was soft, but its grip surprisingly tenacious.

“Chuck. Charles. Hmmm," she mused, studying his hand. The bones were fine, the fingers long and slight, the skin cool. A girl’s hand, if that were possible, only partly because of weakness but more of the way it settled in her own without weight, of a delicate refinement out of character with the rest of the person.

"'Chuck' doesn't really suit you.” Her grin pinched into a thoughtful grimace. “‘Rossignol’... that’s French for a kind of bird... the *nightingale*?” Charlie's heart pounded in his ears as he stared at her hand gripping his, not really taking in what she was saying.

“‘Bird’ ... that’s a term some blokes back home use for ‘girl’.”

Her eyes finally met his looking up at her imploringly. 

“Oh! Sorry,” she gushed, releasing his hand, a blush rising on her cheeks. “I didn’t mean to...” She grinned. “I make you a bit nervous, don't I?”

Her smile, her accent, her smell. Her grip: he was spellbound. "Uh ... yeah, I mean," Dry-mouthed, tentatively he tried to explain. "Well, it's just that, well, I probably shouldn’t be in here.”

“Quite right,” she said wryly with a short chuckle. “I reckon I’d feel a bit awkward in the gents’ myself.”

Charlie turned to go. He was forcing himself, as if his feet had decided they were quite content to remain precisely where they were.

Celeste gently lifted her eyebrows and nodded at the door. It felt less like an command and more like a slightly amused dismissal. He moved numbly, as if being nudged forward. As he pulled open the door, he risked one last glance back, and his stomach did a little flip — the one you get on a roller coaster, or when someone unexpectedly touches your arm.

She was smiling. At him.

“See you, Charlie.”

By the time Charlie entered the cool quiet of the library and put his glasses back on, a dizzying lightness enveloped his being.

He had just met an angel.

### Again, With Feeling

Celeste stared unseeing at the part she had been practicing for the past month, the part for the english horn. Around her, student orchestra musicians were readying their instruments... some were chatting. Some were practicing those difficult bars. Celeste wondered about those bits: she had already mastered her part. 

The instructor, Ms Duncan, took her place as conductor on the podium. 

"As you know, we're going to try that new piece today. I've give you a month to practicing it ... it's not a hard piece. Just a simple serenade for english horn and strings by one of the students here at the high school," she said. "Horns, the rest of you woodwinds and the rest of the class, just pay attention to how this is put together."

Celeste's part wasn't complex. She'd performed more demanding parts on her clarinet. Second beat after the downbeat, she brought the reed to her lip and let the note bloom, not forced, not shy ... *dolce*, mezzo voce, the human voice told through wood and wire. The line was considerate in that way only a good ear writes: it knew where breath lived, where the room inhaled with you. She could feel the orchestra awaken, violas with their heads lifted, second violins stilled into a single spine, cellos quieting so as not to spill light where shadow was wanted.

The phrase stepped once over a small rivelette and landed sure-footed. She didn’t push vibrato; she let it arrive like a confession, then leave. The hall that wasn’t a hall (only the ugly rehearsal room with the scuffed risers) seemed for a moment to forget itself. She played it as if she had been born to this colour, this melancholy that wasn’t sad so much as truthful. For the first time since the restroom incident, she didn’t think of the wrong-door boy; she thought only of the line that had been written by someone who understood breath and refused to crowd it. The piece—**a student piece**, someone had scoffed earlier, did the one unforgivable thing: it made them care. When the cadence resolved, no one spoke at first, as if speech would scuff it.

Then the room exhaled, as a single animal.

The conductor lowered her arms slowly, the way you lower your hands from a hot kettle you’ve realised is bearable. “Whoever wrote this,” she said, half to herself, “listens.” She found Celeste’s eyes. “Again, and strings: no embroidery. Let the English horn tell the story.”

Celeste allowed herself the smallest smile. It was **not** pride but relief. The hours in her room, the reed-scraping until the shaving curled just so, the stubborn long tones that had felt like punishment until they didn’t... none of it had been theatre. The music knew her now. Or she knew it. It was difficult to say which, and that was the point.

The little serenade had three parts... the beginning, a wistful, almost fairy-like idea; the middle was dance-like, almost like a pas-de-deux, carried by a solo violin, with the rest of the strings playing in soft pizzicato. Almost at the end of that section, there was an odd moment of dissonance, which the english horn confidently swept aside with the original melody. 

As the sounds died, the orchestra and conductor sat and stood in speechless silence. Celeste stared unseeing at the page before her.

This was next-level.

They played it again. Celeste pushed the dynamics this time - being in a 'star' role suited her perfectly - and the serenade took on a vibrance, a poignancy that raised the hair on the conductor's neck. Again, piece done, silence. They played it again. It wasn't a difficult piece to perform... they were not playing it over and over to perfect their technique. It was the piece itself: it entranced, bewitched.

“Right,” she said to Ms Duncan quite boldly, unbothered on the surface, burning underneath. “One small request. At B: I’d like a written breath before the leap. It will sing better.”

Ms Duncan made the mark without argument. “You’re not wrong.”

“Thank you.” Celeste paused, then, because it mattered: “And whoever the composer is, tell that person the English horn part is ... considerate.” The word felt indecently intimate in her mouth. “It listens back.”

“High praise,” Ms Duncan said, amused. “I’ll pass it on.”

She returned to her chair, fitted the reed, and let the tip wet again, the way you give a plant a sip before moving it to a sunnier window. The others were watching her in the sideways way orchestras watch one another when something is suddenly real. She lifted the bell, counted the rests, and thought, with an odd, fierce tenderness, **I want to write like that.**

### Who wrote This?

In chemistry, Lauren gave her friend a quizzical second look.

"What's up with you, girl?"

Celeste grimaced. "You know that piece I've been practicing on my english horn?"

"I thought you played the clarinet."

"I *told* you, Miss Duncan had *loaned* me her english horn."

Lauren shrugged. Orchestral stuff didn't 'float her boat'. "Oh yeah ... sorry, I forgot. So, why the weird vibes? Didn't go well?"

Celeste turned to her friend, fixing her with an intense gaze. She seemed to be searching for words.

"Lauren, it was unreal," she finally managed through dry lips. "The loan was for me to play specifically **this piece**. I can still hear the whole thing in my head... I think we only played it three of four times, but it's all ... right there!" She pointed to her head, her eyes wide.

Lauren smiled uneasily. "So, um, what sort of music was it?" she asked cautiously, as if opening a can of expired beans. She feared a long exposition couched in music theory terms.

"It was a serenade some student wrote. It was... insane."

"Insane."

Lauren could be so thick, sometimes. "I know, I'm not making any sense. Look, I've been practicing this piece for the past month or so - it's not hard to play. But today was like, well we heard the whole thing for the first time. The string section and my english horn. I'm telling you, everyone was blown away. Including the teacher!"

"Cool."

"Lauren, you would literally have to hear it. I know you're not into classical stuff..."

"'But' ... do I hear a 'but'?" Lauren cleared her throat. "yeah, nah ... doesn't do it for me, sorry ... not if there's no lyrics." A change came over Celeste again. "What now?"

"I gotta find out who wrote it," Celeste murmured, almost to herself as she turned back to her retorts and beaker.

---

It wasn't until Friday that she got her answer. She'd gone to the music building early that morning in hopes of catching Miss Duncan in her office. The hallways were empty: someone was in a piano room on a piano badly needing tuning. 

"Celeste?" She turned to see her teacher unlocking her office.

"Good morning, Miss Duncan... I won't keep you long. Just have a quick question." Miss Duncan raised her eyebrows. "Um, who wrote that piece we played on Wednesday?"

"He's a junior, here. A quiet kid... well, between you and me, he's got a lot of talent. That serenade!"

"I know, right?" Celeste's eyes shone. "Am I allowed to ask what his name is?"

"Sure. It's Chuck."

Celeste stared at her, eyes wide.

"Chuck."

"Well, Charlie. Charlie Rossi..."

"...ignol," Celeste finished for her softly, pensivefully. She murmured: "Er, thank you..." and walked slowly away, lost in thought.
