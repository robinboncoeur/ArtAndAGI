    He was pulling paper towels, when he heard her voice and quickly turned around. There she was: the prettiest girl he’d ever seen, honestly. Not in a magazine-cover way, not generically pretty... a make-your-heart-beat-faster kind of pretty. Her face was, well, flawless, and it shone with a smile that was both curious and... just a bit mischievous, like she knew something you didn't, and was enjoying the knowledge immensely. She looked to be maybe a year or two older, certainly taller than him. She stood like a ballerina, but one who spent considerable time observing people. Her Charlotte Rampling eyes held you with that unsettling, penetrating gaze. That self-assurance was so complete, it made the fact of her being in the men’s restroom seem like a calculated choice, like she was making a point. You wouldn’t question it, you'd just deal with it.    
  </div>
</div>

“You... ARE a girl. Aren't you?” 🫶

The thought that she might be the one who was misplaced didn’t even register initially. Not even a flicker. He was too busy trying to process the fact that this... this stunning girl, was actually looking at him. Talking to him. She was talking to him. To *him*! And that, at that moment, it was all he could parse, even if it was - or perhaps, *because* it was - unbelieveable. The restroom, the gender, the potential for awkwardness... none of it mattered. Just this. Her. Talking. To him.

Her question seemed… vaguely odd, yes. Like he’d somehow missed a crucial piece of information, a plot point he’d slept through. It was the kind of oddness that suggested a larger, looming *something*. He felt an uncomfortable uneasiness.

“Uh, no, I’m a guy,” Charlie replied cautiously. “Why? Just... wondering... what you...”

The girl’s smile seemed sympathetic. “Oh, sorry. It’s just that your hair is nearly as long as mine, and you’re about the same size as my friends, too: all girls, by the way. Honestly, you’re not built like any bloke I know.” He was so completely, ridiculously charmed by her accent — that lovely, rolling British thing — that he honestly would have basked in her words even if she'd been actively, aggressively insulting him. Probably would have just nodded along, mesmerized. “Plus, well... you’re in the ladies’. Um, you know, the girl's toilet.”

He stared at her for a moment, eyes wide in horror, then glanced quickly around him. Sure enough, no urinals. The colour drained from his face.

“Oh - sh... dear! I’m so, so sorry! I... uh, I can’t believe I...” 

His face went from ashen to bright red in an instant. Only the profound shock of his situation kept him frozen in place, preventing him from bolting. 

Her smile broadened - was a twinkle in her eye. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone if you don’t.” With a slight tilt of her head, she peered at him with a curious regard. Charlie found himself backed into the sinks. What was she going to do? He had invaded a sacred space for women.

        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

*At least she wasn't screaming*.

She gazed at him for what seemed an awkward eternity, then precipitously extended her hand. “My name’s Celeste. Celeste Shelley.”

Not only was she not screaming, she was introducing herself. He hesitated before taking the proffered hand.

“Um, I’m Chuck, um, Charlie Rossignol,” he finally croaked as her hand firmly grasped his. Celeste’s hand was incredibly soft, but its grip, surprisingly tenacious.

“Charlie. *Charles*. Hmmm," she mused, holding a surprisingly delicate set of fingers in her grasp, to her astonishment. "Somehow, that name doesn't really suit you, for some reason.” Her grin pinched into a thoughtful grimace. “‘Rossignol’... that’s French for a kind of bird, isn’t it? The nightingale?”

Charlie stared at the hand gripping his, heart pounding in his ears, not taking in a word she was saying.

“‘Bird’... that’s a term some blokes back home use for ‘girl’,” she mused, seemingly oblivious to his tentative attempts to pull his hand away. She finally cast her eyes down to find him looking up at her imploringly. “Oh! Sorry,” she gushed, a blush rising on her cheeks. “I didn’t mean to...”

She released his hand quickly and grinned. “I make you a bit nervous, don't I?”

Her smile, her accent, her smell. Her grip: he was spellbound, captivated. A captive.

“Uh... yeah, I mean, no..." Dry-mouthed, tentative. "Well, it's just that, well, I guess I shouldn’t be in here.”

“Quite right,” she said with a slight grin. “I reckon I’d feel a bit awkward in the gents’ myself.” She tilted her head slightly, her eyes twinkling. “Anyway, best let you get on, really. I’m sure I’ll bump into you about."

Charlie’s turned to go.

"Well, I hope so, at least.”

*This stunning, poised, confident girl wants to see me again*? 

He felt rooted, not so much *glued* to the floor, but as if his feet had suddenly decided they were quite content to remain precisely where they were. 

Finally Celeste, with a barely perceptible lift of an eyebrow and a nod that felt less like an invitation and more like a gentle, slightly amused dismissal, released him from her "spell"? Or had it been simply... inertia? He moved numbly towards the door, as if being nudged forward, given permission to leave. As he pulled open the door, he risked one last glance back, and his stomach did that ridiculous little flip — the one you get on a roller coaster, or when someone unexpectedly touches your arm.

She was smiling. At him.

“I shall see you soon, Charlie.”

By the time Charlie entered the cool quiet of the library, the lingering queasiness - the shock of being in the wrong bathroom, the ensuing panic - had vanished, replaced by a dizzying lightness. 

He had just met an angel.

## Class Connundrums

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Class1.jpg" alt="Smiles" style="float: right; width: 400px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

It wasn’t until a few days later that Charlie saw her again amidst a group of girls in the hallway at the door of his first period class, algebra. His heart pounded in his ears as he furtively slipped into the classroom, avoiding a look in her direction. With a sigh, he plopped into a seat at the back of the class.

Algebra was his worst subject.

Just as the bell rang signalling the beginning of first period, he noticed Celeste entering the classroom. She elegantly settled herself into a seat in the front row, and then, irradiated his being with a warm smile. 

The class got off to a bad start for Charlie: an unfinished assignment was burning holes into his guilty conscience.

“I may have forgotten to mention that we’re going to have a little quiz at the end of today’s class.” The class groaned — Mrs. Kielley took no notice. “If you have studied, you will be fine.”

During the quiz, Charlie noticed she was rifling through the handed-in homework papers and his heart sank. Just as the bell rang, she called out:

“See you tomorrow! Remember, you’re responsible for chapter 14. Oh, Charlie,” she motioned to him. “Can I see you for a moment?”

Charlie sighed and gathered his things. Out of the corner of his eye he could see Celeste, her head tilted, lips pursed into a sympathetic smile. Paradoxically, her smile made him feel lower than pond scum. He blushed crimson and listlessly approached the teacher.

“Why, Charlie?” This was not their first interview. “I simply don’t understand. I’ve talked to your other teachers: Mrs Farias tells me you’re very bright!”

---

Physical Education was another subject he hated. Coach noticed him entering the locker-room and motioned him into his office.

“A week ago, I had asked you to sign up for track and field. I notice your name is not on the roster. Why is that?”

“I.. uh —” 

“Yeah.” Coach eyed him sternly. “Look, I went out on a limb for you, Charlie. I figured - with your build - track and field would have been a good fit. So, what gives?”

Charlie couldn’t find anything to say.

“Look, I’m over it, helping you. I’m going to give you one last chance before failing you.” Charlie visibly quailled. Failing athletics meant repeating his senior year. “You’re going to join the swim team. It’s your last chance, mate.”

*What swim team? I didn’t know there was a swim team.*

Charlie sat for what felt like ten nervous minutes in Ms. Hamilton’s waiting room — a room, he noted, furnished with an unsettling number of potted ferns — as the muffled sounds of Coach and Ms. Hamilton’s conversation drifted from her office. It wasn't shouting, exactly, more of a low, persistent hum of displeasure. He could just make out something about funding and artistic swimming. The kind of disagreement that made you wonder if the ferns were thriving or slowly, silently dying. He had the distinct, unsettling feeling that he was already a casualty of their debate.

“I told you weeks ago we’ve cancelled the boy’s swim team!”

“I don’t remember you saying anything of the kind!” Coach growled.

“You never pay any attention to anything I say,” Ms Hamilton retorted. “Allow me to refresh your memory — remember that meeting with admin? We were told there’s not enough funding for small teams.”

“Yeah, you said you were going to have the girls do... um, synchronised swimming or something.”

“Artistic swimming! Seven girls have signed up so far. Only one boy had signed up at the time for the men's team, if you remember. So, they cut the program.”

“So, Charlie can swim with the girls...”

“Hell, no! I’d be forever getting him up to speed. You can’t just dump him on me, Coach!”

“Well guess what, I just did!” The door flew open and Coach stormed out of her office.

Presently, Ms Hamilton appeared and stared at Charlie. He hastily got to his feet and began moving to the door.

“Wait.” Ms Hamilton’s gaze had softened. She studied him for a moment before beckoning him into her office. Charlie nervously followed her. She studied him with a curious look in her eye as she settled thoughtfully into her chair.

“Okay, so here’s the problem, Charlie. You probably overheard me discussinging your PE curiculum with Coach. We’ve had to disband the boy’s swim team for lack of interest. It’s just a girl’s team now, and we’re doing artistic swimming. It’s like dancing, but in the water.” She paused for a moment. "Dancing. Like ballet, but in a pool. Have you ever taken ballet, Charlie?"

"No."

She grimaced. “Are you any good at swimming?” His slender frame spoke of an exercise-free lifestyle.

“I used to surf when I lived on the Gold Coast,” Charlie said softly.

“You *used* to surf!” Ms. Hamilton’s expression was incredulous. “How long ago was that?”

“Um, a few years ago,” he admitted quietly, his gaze dropping to the floor.

Ms. Hamilton shrugged and leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms. “Look, I don’t want you to think this is an easy class, even if you're a good swimmer. Artistic swimming is not easy. Just because it’s girls usually doing it doesn’t mean it’s easy.” Her eyes scanned him critically, head to toe. “You’re no taller than any of my girls,” she mused, her tone sharpening slightly. “You’re pretty thin for a surfer. Not exactly what I’d call robust.”

Charlie shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny but said nothing. His lack of activity over the last two years had left him scrawny.

She shrugged again. “Anyway, I suppose you’ll fit in alright with the girls... sizewise, that is.” She couldn’t hide a flicker of disdain. “Do you think you can handle artistic swimming?”

Charlie met her eyes, his voice calm but hesitant. “I’ll have a go.”

Ms. Hamilton didn’t respond immediately. Instead, she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk, her fingers interlaced as she studied him.

        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

“Look, Charlie,” she began, her tone firm but not unkind. “You should know what you’re up against. Artistic swimming isn’t just about being in the water. It’s about precision, stamina, and grace —  things my girls have been practicing for a fair bit, now.” She leaned back in her chair. “Girls are built for this kind of work. They’ve got better endurance, more flexibility, and can move with a kind of rhythm and grace that doesn’t come naturally to boys.” She let that sink in before continuing. “Plus, my girls have been training for a **long** time. It’s not just about physicality — it’s about practice, discipline, and performing as a team.”

Charlie shifted uncomfortably. “I guess I’ll just have to work harder, then.”

Ms. Hamilton tilted her head slightly, a flicker of something resembling approval crossing her face. “Oh yes, you most definitely will have to work harder, mate. Much harder! Certainly harder than any of my girls! But...” She paused, giving him a measured look. “If you’re willing to put in the effort, I’m willing to let you have a go.” She stood, signaling that the conversation was over. “See you tomorrow. Be ready for some hard yakka, mate.”

Charlie nodded quickly, rising to leave. But before he stepped out of the office, her voice stopped him.

“Oh, and Charlie? Don’t expect any of us to go easy on you because you’re new — or a boy. You're expected to keep up.”

## Marie Claire?

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Class2.jpg" alt="Shake hands" style="float: left; width: 350px;
        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

On his way home from school, Charlie meandered past the bay into the park. The cool afternoon breeze from the bay blended sea fragrance with the familiar smell of decaying fish remains and mangroves. The grasses of the park had enjoyed a trimming, leaving that delicious scent of fresh-mown grass. One lone seagull glided over the wind-swept, grey water. There was another smell, one that would have invoked the question whether it was going to rain if Charlie had been there with someone. But he wasn't, he was alone. As per usual.

“**I shall see you soon, Charlie.**”

Did that actually happen?

A brief blush crossed his face. *Okay, so the ladies’ restroom isn’t the ideal place to meet new people*. 

How could he have wandered in there by mistake? And the shock, the abject horror of being in a *sacred place*, in a woman's place, a place he absolutely should **not** have been - the consequences of being found there could have been catastrophic - ...and so as his ruminations escalated, his imagination ran away with him. At emotionally intense times, music took over his consciousness... Ralph Vaughan Williams' Norfolk Rhapsody thundered in his head. It offered no solace, but magnified his anxiety.

Charlie took in a breath as he watched the seagull swooped back and finally land on top of a piling, flawlessly. No incident. No being hauled off to the authorities to explain himself for a moment of absent-mindedness. He slowed his breathing... he began to feel calm, once again.

And there was no incident because... Celeste.

Well, so much for feeling calm. That whole ill-advised detour into the girls’ bathroom — the ensuing embarrassment, the flailing attempts at explanation — it all sort of... faded. Like background noise. What stuck, what lingered in a way that felt almost unsettling, was the sheer effect she had. It wasn’t a dramatic, movie-style shift, not exactly. More like a subtle tilting of the world. Suddenly, things felt unsteady. He was grasping for something solid, something familiar, and finding nothing. It was as if she’d loosened the docklines without telling him, and he was now adrift. He couldn’t stop thinking about her, which felt both ridiculous and inevitable. The remote possibility of actually seeing her again — just even the *thought* of it — produced a peculiar mix of thrill and low-grade panic. Her look... it was intoxicating, certainly. But also, undeniably, a little frightening.

“**I shall see you soon**.”

The first drops of rain felt cool on his skin as he opened the mailbox. The sky was heavy with bruised-looking clouds you get right before a proper downpour. He pulled out the magazine — some glossy thing of his aunt's. The thought occurred to him, with a familiar weariness, that girls didn’t generally gravitate toward skinny runts. ‘Nigel NoFriends’ types. Basically, guys like him. It wasn’t exactly a revelation — he’d been aware of this for years, really — but somehow, today, that notion's pinch was sharper. Like a cold-shoulder reality check. He darted for the porch. Slipping the key into the lock, he was startled by a voice directly behind him.

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-FDoor1.jpg" alt="Swimming" style="float: right; width: 350px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

"Hello, girl!"

He whirled around, startled. Celeste. She was standing just behind him on the porch, appearing as suddenly as the rain. He blinked, a little disoriented. *How had she gotten here*? He hadn’t heard a thing.

“Oh, hi Celeste!” he finally managed to stammer. His mind raced for something clever to say. “Do you live around here?”

Fail! *Of course she lives around here — what kind of question was that*? Celeste’s grin widened.

“Yeah, I’m just a couple of doors down,” she replied casually, her eyes drifting towards the magazine in his hand. "Is that Marie Claire?"

Charlie's stomach dropped — a women’s fashion magazine. Nervelessly, he handed the magazine to Celeste.

“Marie Claire! I’m impressed, Charlie!” Celeste said, her voice alight with enthusiasm. “Great choice.”

Did she think it was his subscription? “Yeah, well, uh, actually, my aunt, um...” he mumbled, his ears burning.

“Oh.” Her face fell with a flicker of disappointment. réunissez

*Wait, what? Why might Celeste think he’d be subscribing to Marie Claire? And even more puzzling, why did she seem disappointed to learn he wasn’t*? The whole thing made his head spin. These were murky waters: murky, and rather deep.

“Celeste, um...” He swallowed, clutching at anything that might smooth the moment over. “Wanna have a look? At the magazine, I mean,” he added, his face reddening.

“What, here on the porch?” She tilted her head innocently.

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Kitch1.jpg" alt="Shake hands" style="float: left; width: 350px;
        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

“No-no! I meant, would you like to come in?" In the back of his mind something threw a 'red danger flag', but he was trying so hard to be a good host as well as not be seen as a complete loser that he completely ignored it." I mean, please come in. I’m sure my aunt wouldn’t mind. I mean, for you to read her magazine.” He was yapping and he knew it. He tried desperately to keep his voice steady but his red face gave it away.

Celeste studied him carefully, biting her lower lip to suppress a smile. 

"Are you sure it’s alright? I shouldn’t want to upset your aunt."

They went into the kitchen. Charlie offered Celeste a soft drink but she declined, asking for a glass of water instead.

“Water is better for the skin,” she explained.

“I—um—didn’t realise…” he mumbled as he put the unopened can back in the fridge. Behind him, Celeste pursed her lips with an approving, amused moue.

“So, Charlie, what do you do for fun?”

“For fun? Um, well, I sort-of write music,” he replied shyly.

“Really! What, like pop songs? Or jazz?”

“No. Actually, um, more like, sort-of classical. Like, for orchestra.”

“*Really!* Please show me.”

He gulped. “Hang on... I’ll just get my laptop.”

## What is Misogyny?

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Bedr1.jpg" alt="Swimming" style="float: right; width: 350px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
        
He darted to his room to retrieve his laptop from the desk. It wasn’t until he turned back that he realised Celeste had followed him to his room. Her approach had been so silent her presence in the room startled him: she’d moved like an owl gliding noiselessly in the night. She casually settled herself cross-legged on his bed, leaning back slightly with her hands behind her, her demeanour as relaxed as if she were in her own room. Her sharp eyes swept over the decor—a vase of silk flowers on the bedside table, framed floral prints adorning the walls, and a bedspread resplendent with pastel blossoms.

“Nice room!” Her eyes swept across the space. “Love the, um, delicate touches. Did you decorate it yourself?”

Charlie shook his head, the heat rising to his cheeks once again. “Auntie got this bedspread when she got hers, so she decided to make my room a bit more to her liking. The pictures are her idea too. She says they bring positive vibes or something.”

Celeste tilted her head slightly, her lips curving into a soft, skeptical smile. “Positive vibes,” she murmured, her tone light but carrying a note of amusement. She had crossed her legs on the bed, the skirt of her dress riding up just enough to reveal a glimpse of white. Charlie’s breath hitched—he didn’t know where to look. His gaze flickered downward and back up again, guilt and confusion flitting across his features. His head spun.
Was she aware? She was studying him with that inscrutable smile—a warm, gentle, almost sympathetic smile—but there was something else in that calm confidence, the angle of her neck, the way she tilted her head, that made him feel oddly vulnerable. She was so sure of herself, so entirely at ease, while he felt like he was fumbling along.

She leaned back slightly, still perched on the bed, her eyes lingering on him for a moment longer than felt natural. Her smile deepened—just a little. Was she trying to reassure him? Why did that fact—that she was trying to reassure him—unsettle him instead?

She quietly held out the plastic-wrapped magazine.

“Plastic covers… I so hate plastic. Could you—”

  <div class="columnB">
    He cut into the edge of the plastic wrapping with his nails and pulled it off. As he handed the magazine back to her, she unexpectedly grasped his hand and pulled him to sit on the bed beside her.<br>
    <br>
    “You’ve got *lovely* nails, Charles,” she said with an approving smile. “I know plenty of girls who’d be absolutely jealous of those.” She paused, her gaze steady and searching. “But of course you are **definitely** not a girl." She paused, pursing her lips, staring at him intently.<br>
    <br>
    Then, with just a hint of sarcasm: "Right!”
  </div>
</div>

He floundered in a sea of confusion: he wanted her to like him, but instinctively balked at any reference to feminine attributes, no matter how positive she might have considered them.

Charlie blushed. “No, I’m... I mean,” he mumbled. “I used to bite my nails as a kid. My aunt has been putting something on them so I wouldn’t.”

“I see. Well, they look truly lovely.”

Charlie quickly flipped his laptop open to cover his confusion. As the notation software loaded, he couldn’t help but notice out of the corner of his eye that she wasn’t looking at the screen at all but was studying him intently. When a violin concerto finally loaded and he played it, she showed a genuine interest.

“You wrote this?”

He shook his head.

“No, I’m *studying* it. It’s a violin concerto by Miclos Rozsa. It was in the movie ‘The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes’.” There was pride in his voice. “I’m a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes!”

“Why?”

He glanced at her, alarmed at her sudden cold tone of voice.

“Um, what do you mean?”

“Well, if the book is anything like the TV series then Sherlock was a misogynist.”

“A what?”

“He didn’t like women.” She grimaced, her gaze even more intense. “Do you like women?”

Charlie gulped. “What do you mean? Of *course* I like women, Celeste!”

“So, what is it about Holmes you find appealing?” she pressed.

“His, um, brain. His intelligence. His ability to see clues where others see nothing.”

“I see.” A fleeting smile crossed her lips. “Is that what made you decide to take algebra?”

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Bedr1.jpg" alt="Swimming" style="float: right; width: 350px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Charlie reddened, and dropped his gaze.

“I thought I had to take a math subject.”

He felt her hand slide over his and looked at her face in surprise. Her regard was full of concern. 

“You struggle with math, don’t you, *Sharl*?” 

There was no point in denying it. Charlie nodded, completely oblivious to how she'd mispronounced his name.

“You know, I could help you a bit with if you’d like,” she suggested gently.

Charlie looked at her despondently. “You would be wasting your time. Mrs Kielley thinks I’m hopeless. She reckons I should stick to remedial maths.” Which wasn't true: his teacher was convinced Charles was bright enough. The problem was: he didn't believe her.

“Oh, I think you smarter than that,” Celeste declared brightly. “I think I could give you a few pointers that would make all the difference.”

“Really? What pointers?”

“What do you mean by that, Charlie? You don’t sound like you believe me.”

“No-no, I totally believe you, Celeste!” he countered urgently. “I just can’t believe you would, um like... even want to, um like... be here, um...”

“Oh, *Sharl*, now you’re being silly! Why wouldn’t I want to, you goose? I *am* actually here, aren’t I? You are not making any sense at all.” A suspicious look crossed her face, her brow furrowing as her eyes narrowed slightly and her tone turned sharper. “This is because I’m a girl, isn’t it? Go on, admit it. You don’t think girls are smart enough to be able to help you!”

“What? no!” Charlie retorted. “What does being a girl have to do with anything?” 

Celeste’s eyes drilled searchingly into his for a moment.

“Okay, so, what is it?”

Charlie looked unseeing at his hands. “I guess, I mean, I can’t figure out why you’d be interested in helping me.” He stopped, and looked at her questioningly. “Like, when... I um, ended up in the wrong restroom and you were so nice to me — even those I must have seemed such a hopeless case...” His voice trailed off.

“I decided then that I liked you.”

“You liked me?” His face registered complete disbelief.

“Yes, I **liked** you!” She shook her head, exasperated but amused. “Honestly, I’m not sure what’s so hard to grasp about that. Something about you said you were definitely not like any of the other blokes.” She paused for a moment. “Anyway, I asked Amanda about you — she had mentioned you’re in some of the same classes — and she said you were struggling with algebra.” She paused, watching his mouth fall open in astonishment. “That’s why I was in your class today.”

“Oh, I thought…”

“What? That I’m taking algebra? I’m a senior. I’m taking calculus.” His mouth formed an unspoken ‘o’. “You got called up after class, didn’t you, Charlie?” She grimaced slightly as she squeezed his hand. “What was that about?”

Charlie stared at the floor, shoulders slumped in defeat, and shrugged helplessly. Without a word, she shifted closer, the soft, floral notes of her perfume enveloping him. Her bouquet was calming, like her presence—a quiet, unspoken promise that she was there, that she would help. The scent lingered, subtly anchoring him to her, its warmth settling into his thoughts like a tether he didn’t realize he was holding onto.

“Believe me, I can help you, Charlie. And I want to. If you let me, I will!”

He stared at her, still incredulous.

<img src="/assets/images/CelCh1/Cel-Bedr3.jpg" alt="Shake hands" style="float: left; width: 350px;
        margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />
        
She chortled. “I can read you like an open book, Charlie. Yes, you, Charl!” She lifted her chin with a hint of imperiousness. “I should warn you, though — I’m no pushover. I don’t take prisoners. If you want my help, you’d better be prepared to stick with it. And,” she added meaningfully, “there’s a catch to me teaching you. *Girl*.”

There it was again. The ‘girl’ thing. “Which is?”

“I'm not telling you now - you’ll find out soon enough, *Sharl*.” She rose. “Look, I should really go.” She swung her long hair over her shoulder and they headed for the front door, Charlie following her meekly.

“Thanks for coming over,” Charlie said earnestly. “I promise I’ll be a good student.”

She smiled — there was a hint of pity in that smile.

“You won’t have a choice, Charl.”

He held the door open as she stepped out, that uneasy feeling almost overwhelming him as she made her way down the sidewalk. “If you want, we can start anytime,” he called out after her. “I’m always here, um... anyway.” The desperation in his voice disgusted him but he was unable to stop babbling.
Celeste turned and waved. “I will let you know, Sharl.”

Did she just call me ‘Sharl’?

“By the way, don’t be a misogynist. Girls should not be misogynists.” With which Parthian shot she strode away, leaving him open-mouthed behind her.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">







Over dinner he thought he’d run the misogynist question by aunt Betty.

“Aunty, do you think I’m a... um, misogynist?”

Betty stared at him, puzzled.

“Misogynist? What a strange thing to ask, honey. Why in the world would you think that?”

Charlie cleared his throat.

“Well, I don’t, but this girl —”

“Girl?”

“Yeah, I met this girl in, um, well.” He blushed furiously.

“What! Out with it — where did you meet this girl?”

“I met her in the ladies restroom at the library yesterday,” Charlie whispered.
        
Betty’s mouth fell open. She stared at him in consternation.

“What in blue blazes were you doing in the ladies restroom, Charlie?!”

“I went in there by mistake, aunty! Really, I did! And this girl, she —”

“Go on.”

“Well, she asked me if I was a girl.”

“Well, at least she didn’t scratch your eyes out.” Betty’s frown melted slowly into a funny smirk. “What made her say that?” This girl sounded intriguing.

“She said it’s because my hair is almost as long as hers.”

“So? Nothing wrong with your hair!” Betty shot back, a protective edge to her voice. She had insisted he grow it out, imagining him as one of those dashing heroes from romance novels. It somehow hadn’t occurred to her that his smooth face, soft voice, and long locks might get him mistaken for a girl. “We’re not cutting it,” she added with finality and reached out to pat his hand. “Relax,” she said warmly. “You don’t look like a girl, Charles. Sure, your hair’s a little long, but it suits you. You’ve got great hair — don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”

“Anyway, I really didn’t think I’d ever see her again. Would have made sense—she probably thought I was some sort of freak, being in the ladies restroom and all.”

“Honey, don’t say things like that!”

Charlie shrugged. “So, I saw her again in algebra. And then, when I got home, well, there she was! She lives just down the street. Anyway, I invited her in —”

“You invited her in? Why?”

Charlie blushed. “Well, she saw the magazine — your Marie Claire — and thought it was mine. I told her that it was yours but that you probably wouldn’t mind if she had a look —”

“And you took it upon yourself to invite her in?” He cast his eyes downward at her look of disapproval. “That was a bit careless of you, wasn’t it?”

“She’s a girl!” Charlie retorted. “What is she going to do, rob me at gunpoint?”

“Don’t be silly, Charles. Girls can get up to all sorts of mischief. Maybe not as much as boys do, but it pays to be sensible. You need to be careful, honey.”

Charlie shrugged again. “Okay. Whatever. Anyway, we got to talking and I showed her what I was doing in Blender and we started talking about Sherlock Holmes. She asked me why I was so impressed by him. She said he was a misogynist: a guy who hates women.”

“I know what a misogynist is,” Betty said quietly. She sighed: she’d had plenty of personal experience with misogyny. “What’s your friend’s name?”

“Celeste. She’s, uh —” He paused, a bit embarrassed. Betty smiled knowingly.

“Pretty?”

“She is beyond beautiful,” Charlie replied fervently. “I just can’t figure out why she came here at all.”

“Maybe she likes you?”

“Auntie, she could have any guy she wants!”

She smiled at him. “Sounds like Celeste is a nice girl. I’m so glad you made a nice friend.” There was a warmth in her smile that carried a quiet assurance. “And no, I don’t think you have it in you to be a misogynist, darling.”

Celeste caught up with him just as he was leaving the school grounds the next day.

    “Mind if I walk with you?”<br><br>
    His heart pounding, he blushed.<br>
    “Sure! I mean, no. I mean: no, I don’t mind. Please do.”<br>
    They walked in silence for a while: Charlie couldn’t think of anything to say, and Celeste was enjoying the peace and quiet.<br>
    As they stopped at the bay, he caught her glancing at him from time to time. She seemed lost in thought. For a moment, the only sounds were the ocean waves in the distance and the rustle of leaves in the breeze. Then, without warning, Celeste turned to him, her dark eyes locking on his with sudden intensity.<br><br>
    “Did you know that we all look like females in the first stages of our existence?”

“What?” Charlie stared at her, incredulous.

“It’s true. Look it up if you don’t believe me. We all start out as female, in a way. I’m studying genetics — Mr Laudin, my biology teacher, has been giving us some extra assignments, and I wanted to understand chromosomes better. Apparently, until about seven weeks into development, you can’t tell the gender. We all resemble females at first.”

“You’re kidding!”

“Nope!” Celeste took his arm, guiding him as they walked. “But there’s more. You know men are genetically XY, right?”

“Yeah?”

“The Y chromosome is what makes males, well, male,” Celeste explained, her tone growing dramatic. “But — and this is the interesting bit — not all Y chromosomes are fully functional. In fact, in some people, very few are.”

Where the heck is she going with this?

They stopped suddenly. She drew close and stared at him. “Here’s the thing, Sharl,” she began, her tone deliberate. “There are plenty of reasons, like a missing or faulty Y chromosome, or something like androgen insensitivity syndrome, why someone might develop into a girl. The point is, ‘girl’ is the default human setting.”

Charlie felt a dizzying sensation of being caught in a whirlwind spinning him into a green jungle chasm. An arm encircling his waist kept him from being swallowed entirely by the chasm. He looked to see who held him so tightly by the waist.

It was Celeste.

She was the whirlwind. She was also holding him by the waist.
