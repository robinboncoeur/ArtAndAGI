# And Began


Absolutely. And it’s the right moment to let Charlie’s personality *breathe*—not by giving him swagger, but by giving him **principled concern** and **quiet spine**.

Also: your instinct to keep the costume transition *clinical* is the most important protective measure you can take. The scene should read like:

* an HR meeting,
* a safety briefing,
* a uniform fitting for access control,

—not like a makeover.

And Charlie’s “largely feminine reveal” isn’t about his look; it’s about his *values*:

* reputational awareness,
* long-term thinking,
* protective instincts expressed through restraint,
* and a refusal to let Celeste be harmed by cheap optics.

That’s extremely woman-readable. And it’s the opposite of kink.

Below is the next scene, Celeste POV, with the to-and-fro, the extraction of truth, Celeste prevailing, and the “do this / do that because” tone.

## Celeste — Terms

The back room was where we kept the things that weren’t meant to be seen.

Not secret, exactly. Just… unromantic. Underlayers. Spare pins. The dull mechanics of historical illusion.

It smelled faintly of starch and lavender sachets and the honest metal tang of needles.

I shut the door behind Charlie and leaned my clipboard against the shelf. I didn’t sit. Sitting turns conversations into confessions.

Charlie stood near the centre of the room as if he’d been placed there, hands at his sides, posture careful. He looked at the closed door, then at me.

His voice came out steady, but his throat moved before the first word, betraying him.

“They moved you,” he said.

“Yes.”

He nodded once, as if he’d already done the arithmetic. “Lady of the Manor.”

“Yes.”

His mouth tightened. “They’ll put you in front of donors.”

“Yes.”

“And they’ll—” He paused, searching for the clean word. “They’ll watch you.”

I waited.

Charlie’s gaze flicked down to the floorboards, then up again. He wasn’t shy. He was… choosing accuracy.

“They won’t watch you to see if you do it well,” he said quietly. “They’ll watch you to see if they can catch you doing it wrong.”

It wasn’t melodrama. It was analysis.

The sentence landed in my chest with a cold, familiar recognition. He understood more than most people twice his age.

“Yes,” I said.

Charlie exhaled once, controlled. “And if there’s any… talk—”

“About me,” I supplied.

He flinched, not because I’d named it, but because I’d named it without embarrassment.

“Yes,” he said. “It’s not fair, but it won’t matter. It’ll stick.”

He swallowed.

“Celeste,” he added, voice low, “they’ll ruin you for sport.”

There it was: genuine concern, unperformed. Not obsequious. Not worshipful. Protective in the way women learn to be protective: by anticipating reputational harm and trying to prevent it before it exists.

I let a beat pass.

Then I asked, evenly, “Is that what you’re worried about?”

Charlie’s eyes held mine. For a moment he looked almost angry—at the situation, at the unfairness of it, at his own inability to stop it with simple logic.

“Yes,” he said. “Of course.”

“Only that?” I asked.

He blinked.

I watched him think. That was the tell with Charlie: he didn’t lie quickly. He tried to find a true sentence that didn’t cost too much.

“Also,” he admitted, quieter, “they’ll replace you.”

“They’ve tried,” I said.

“They will,” he insisted, and the insistence wasn’t rebellion—it was fear disguised as practicality. “They’ll give you someone else. A… maid. Someone who’ll be with you all day.”

“Yes,” I said again.

Charlie’s jaw tightened. His hands flexed once at his sides, like he wanted to do something useful with this helplessness.

“And then,” he said, very carefully, “where does that leave me?”

Ah.

There it was—the second truth, the one he’d been trying not to say out loud.

Not jealousy. Not entitlement.

Vulnerability.

His future had become tangled with mine. Not because he’d pursued it. Because I’d built structure around him, and now the structure was being rearranged by people who didn’t care whether he survived it.

I nodded once. “So you’re worried about my reputation and your position.”

He looked faintly ashamed, as if caring about his own survival made him selfish.

I didn’t let him wear that.

“That’s intelligent,” I said.

Charlie blinked, thrown.

“It’s the correct fear,” I added. “It means you understand how this place works.”

He swallowed. “I don’t want you… damaged,” he said, then corrected himself quickly, flustered by the intimacy of the word. “I mean—socially. Professionally.”

I let his correction sit there. Not because it amused me. Because it revealed something useful.

You can tell what someone thinks they’re allowed to want by what they apologise for wanting.

I stepped closer—not invading, simply reducing the distance enough to make the conversation unavoidable.

“Tell me,” I said, “what you think the story will be if you remain attached to me openly.”

Charlie’s face tightened. He didn’t look away.

“They’ll say you… keep a boy,” he said, and the word *keep* tasted sour in his mouth. “They’ll say you’re—”

“Improper,” I finished for him.

He nodded, jaw clenched.

“And what will they say about you?” I asked.

Charlie’s eyes flickered. “That I’m… pathetic,” he said, almost inaudible. “That I’m using you. That I’m—”

He stopped, unable to say the ugliest versions out loud.

I didn’t rescue him from it. I gave him the truth with the same clinical calm I’d used on the man at the thoroughfare.

“They’ll say you’re a joke,” I said. “And they’ll enjoy saying it.”

Charlie’s nostrils flared. A flash of anger. Good. Anger is integrity waking up.

“I don’t care what they say about me,” he muttered.

“That’s a lie,” I replied.

He froze.

I went on, still calm. “You care. Because you’re not stupid. Because you know that words become doors that close.”

Charlie’s shoulders dropped a fraction, the way someone’s do when their bluff is called and they’re relieved not to have to maintain it.

“Yes,” he admitted.

I nodded. “Good.”

Charlie stared at me, uncertain. “So what do we do?”

I picked up my clipboard again and flipped it open, as if the answer were already written. It wasn’t—but the gesture mattered. It framed the next part as policy, not drama.

“We control the optics,” I said.

Charlie’s eyes widened slightly. “How?”

I met his gaze. “You stop reading as a boy at my elbow.”

His throat moved. He went very still.

“No,” he said, immediately.

The speed of it surprised me. Not because he disobeyed—because he hadn’t disobeyed me yet, not in any meaningful way. It surprised me because the refusal wasn’t childish. It was protective.

“Celeste,” he said, voice tight, “if anyone thinks you’ve done that to me—”

“Listen,” I cut in, gently but sharp. “Stop making up a story where I’m a villain, Charlie. I don’t need rescuing from a rumour you invented.”

His face flushed. “I’m not—”

“You are,” I said, still calm. “You’re imagining the worst interpretation and trying to prevent it by sacrificing yourself pre-emptively.”

Charlie swallowed. His hands clenched, then unclenched.

“I’m trying to protect you,” he said, low.

“I know,” I replied. “But you don’t protect me by disappearing. You protect me by making the system work.”

He stared at me like he wanted to argue, but couldn’t find a point that wasn’t just fear.

I pressed.

“This is not about you becoming anything,” I said. “It is not identity. It is not performance. It is uniform.”

Charlie’s jaw worked. “Uniform,” he repeated, as if testing the word for lies.

“Yes,” I said. “Access control. Social camouflage.”

He looked down, then up again. “And what does that make me?”

I didn’t blink.

“My aide,” I said. “My attendant. My continuity.”

Charlie’s breath hitched.

“And if I say no?” he asked.

There it was—the first real boundary he’d offered me. Not defiant. Just… human.

I respected it by answering honestly.

“Then I accept a stranger,” I said. “And Wardrobe becomes a place you no longer belong, because the people above us will decide you were an indulgence.”

Charlie’s face went pale.

I watched him absorb it. Not because I enjoyed it. Because truth is the only ethical lever.

He looked at me with a kind of quiet panic now—adult panic, the fear of being made disposable.

“Celeste,” he said, “I can’t— I don’t know how to—”

“Then you’ll learn,” I replied.

His eyes flashed. “Learn *what*?”

I held his gaze. “The invisible curriculum.”

He stared, breathing shallow. “That’s not fair.”

“No,” I agreed. “It isn’t.”

We stood in the small, practical room, the shelves around us full of fabric and pins and the dull mechanics of roles.

Then Charlie said, almost pleading, “People will think you’re… doing it for fun.”

I stepped closer again, just one pace. Enough to make the next sentence land like a rule.

“People will think whatever is easiest for them,” I said. “Our job is to make it expensive for them to say it out loud.”

Charlie swallowed.

“How?” he whispered.

“By removing the spectacle,” I said. “By making it boring. By making it look like work.”

He stared at me. I could see his mind fighting—wanting the answer to be something else, something simpler, something that didn’t require his body as a solution.

But he also understood something deeper: the institution didn’t care about fairness. It cared about optics.

I turned slightly toward the shelf and took down a folded bundle.

It was not a dress. Not a fantasy. Not “pretty.”

It was a plain maid’s kit: shift, stays, petticoat, modest gown, apron, cap. Practical. Period-correct. Functional.

I placed it on the table like equipment.

Charlie’s eyes fixed on it. His face tightened.

“I won’t—” he began.

“You will,” I said, not cruelly. “Because you said you care about my future.”

His throat bobbed. “I do.”

“Then prove it,” I replied.

Charlie closed his eyes for a second, like someone bracing for cold water.

When he opened them, he looked at the kit again—less like an object of shame and more like a problem to be solved.

He spoke quietly. “If I do this… it’s not because I want it.”

“I know,” I said.

“And you’re not—” He swallowed. “You’re not making me… into something.”

“I’m not,” I said, flat. “I’m putting you in a uniform that makes men leave me alone.”

Charlie flinched, because the truth was sharp.

Then he nodded once—small, unwilling, but real.

“Alright,” he said. “Tell me what to do.”

Good.

That sentence wasn’t obedience. It was consent under constraint. Different thing. Important thing.

I kept my voice clinical, as promised—no softness, no teasing, no spectacle.

“First,” I said, “we remove your shirt and trousers. Not because this is intimate. Because underlayers can’t sit correctly over seams and buckles.”

Charlie’s ears went red. “Celeste—”

“Charlie,” I said, and the use of his name steadied him. “This room is Wardrobe. Not a story. You will not make this dramatic.”

He swallowed and nodded.

“Second,” I continued, “the shift goes on first. It’s linen. It prevents chafing and keeps outer layers clean. You will appreciate that, because you’re the kind of person who appreciates clean.”

Charlie gave a thin, reluctant exhale that might have been a laugh if he weren’t terrified.

“Third,” I said, lifting the stays, “this goes on over the shift. Not tight. Not to shape you. To support posture and distribute the weight of the gown. If you’re going to carry my standard, you don’t slouch.”

Charlie stared at the stays as if they were a device from another century—which, of course, they were.

“I can’t breathe in that,” he said.

“You can,” I replied. “Because we won’t lace it like a performance. We lace it like work.”

He swallowed. “Okay.”

“Fourth,” I said, “petticoat. It creates the line and prevents the gown from tangling your legs. You are small. If you trip, the joke writes itself. So we remove the opportunity.”

Charlie’s jaw clenched. “You really think of everything.”

“Yes,” I said. “That’s why I’m inconvenient.”

He blinked at that, startled.

I didn’t let the moment open into anything tender.

“Fifth,” I continued, “gown. Plain. Dark. No ornament. You are not here to be admired. You are here to be overlooked.”

Charlie nodded again, eyes fixed on the table, breathing controlled.

“And last,” I said, lifting the cap, “hair. Your hair is your risk. Loose hair reads romantic. Loose hair reads ‘girl.’ Loose hair invites commentary. We pin it and cap it so it reads labour.”

Charlie looked up sharply. “My hair is… romantic?”

“It can be,” I said. “And we don’t allow that.”

His mouth tightened, but he nodded.

He stood there for a moment, hands hovering uselessly near the table, as if he didn’t know where to start.

I watched him—this slender boy who had learned to carry rules like tools, now facing the realisation that women carry rules like *skin.*

He looked up again, voice small. “And if someone recognises me?”

I met his eyes.

“Then you don’t panic,” I said. “You don’t apologise. You say: *Wardrobe.* You say: *work.* And you keep moving.”

Charlie swallowed hard.

“And if they laugh?” he asked.

I paused.

Then I gave him the most honest answer I had.

“They will,” I said. “At first. And then they’ll get bored, because boredom is the only thing that starves cruelty.”

Charlie’s eyes shone with something he didn’t want to feel—fear, grief, anger, all braided together.

He looked away quickly, blinking it back into obedience.

“I hate this,” he whispered.

“I know,” I said.

He exhaled, shoulders rising and falling once.

Then he reached, finally, for the first layer.

“Tell me again,” he said quietly, “why we’re doing this.”

I watched his hands shake, just slightly, as he unfolded the linen.

I kept my voice steady, clinical, and true.

“Because they want to isolate me,” I said. “And I’m not letting them.”

Charlie nodded once.

And began.
