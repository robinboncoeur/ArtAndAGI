# Scene 13

**or better known as Twelve-and-a-Half**

— **“First Attempt”** (Celeste POV, full prose)


Mara didn’t bring the stays out with ceremony.

She laid the materials on the cutting table the way a surgeon lays out instruments: in plain sight, deliberately spaced, nothing decorative about the order. Canvas folded into a clean rectangle. A length of linen tape, already pressed. A small bundle of reed boning tied with string. A tin of grommets that looked comically minor for the amount of authority they were about to carry.

Charlie arrived a minute late and tried to apologise with his body—small shoulders, quick glance, a quietness that wanted to pay for the inconvenience in advance.

Mara didn’t accept payment in the form of shrinking.

“Don’t do that,” she said, without looking up from the table.

Charlie froze mid-breath. “Do… what?”

“Arrive like you’re already wrong.” Mara lifted the canvas and shook it once. The sound was flat and honest. “You’re here. That’s the point. Now, pay attention.”

He stepped closer, careful not to crowd. I watched his gaze take inventory without touching. He was good at that: reading surfaces, anticipating what mattered, trying to solve problems before anyone gave him the chance.

Mara didn’t reward pre-emptive heroics.

She nodded toward the ledger—still on the table, still heavy with its quiet insistence. “Open it.”

Charlie did, flipping to a clean page as if the paper might bruise. His pen hovered, waiting for permission.

“Title,” Mara said.

He wrote: **STAYS — ATTEMPT 1**. Underneath, he added the date without being asked.

Mara approved it only by continuing.

“These aren’t costume stays,” she said, tapping the canvas with two fingers. “They’re working stays. People keep confusing the two. Costume stays hold a silhouette for a photograph. Working stays hold a person for a day.”

Charlie’s pen moved, quick, neat enough to read.

I leaned on the table’s edge and watched his hand. When he wrote, he looked calmer. It was as if structure allowed him to be present without having to perform.

Mara laid out the pattern pieces. Nothing flamboyant—clean shapes that looked simple until you imagined them curved, tightened, forced to behave over bones and breath and movement.

“Your first attempt will fail,” Mara said. She said it the way she might say *it will rain on Thursday.* Not cruel. Not kind. Just factual.

Charlie blinked. “Is that… normal?”

Mara’s eyes flicked to him. “If someone tells you their first stays were perfect, they’re either lying or they don’t move in them.”

He swallowed, and for a moment I saw that old instinct—the urge to vanish so nobody could watch him be imperfect.

Mara caught it immediately.

“Charlie.” She said his name like a hand on a shoulder—firm pressure, not comfort. “The garment fails. You document it. We fix it. That’s the work.”

He nodded once. A small, stiff motion. But it was a yes.

Mara slid the chalk toward him. “Mark your seam allowances. And don’t be stingy. The first mock-up gets room to tell the truth.”

Charlie’s fingers closed around the chalk, and he began.

The workshop was quiet in the good way—scissors snipping, chalk whispering, the soft drag of canvas against the grain of the table. Outside, somewhere beyond the walls, the faire was waking: faint voices, the clink of something metal being unloaded, a distant laugh that didn’t belong to anyone in our room.

In here, it was trade.

Mara moved around him, watching without hovering. Every now and then she corrected a hand position with two taps of her knuckles against the table. Once, she stopped him entirely.

“No. Your stitch length is too eager.”

Charlie looked up, confused.

“You’re trying to impress the seam,” Mara said. “The seam doesn’t care about your feelings. It cares whether it holds.”

His ears coloured. He adjusted, shortened his stitch, slowed down. I filed the sentence away because it was Mara in a nutshell—brutally useful.

When the pieces were cut and aligned, Mara indicated the curtain rail with a tilt of her head. The newly fixed track sat straight and solid above the fitting nook, the curtain hanging like a clean boundary rather than a flimsy suggestion.

“Same conditions,” she said.

Charlie’s eyes flicked there instantly—relief and tension arriving together.

“Yes,” he said. “Same conditions.”

Mara’s gaze held him. “Say it properly.”

Charlie hesitated, then forced the words out as if they were heavier than any bolt of fabric. “Door locked. Curtain closed. Nobody enters. Nobody talks about it.”

“Good,” Mara said. “That includes you, Celeste.”

“I wasn’t planning on narrating it,” I replied.

Mara gave me a look that suggested she wasn’t interested in my tone. “I’m not accusing you. I’m setting standards.”

I let my mouth shut. She was right, and she liked people who could accept that without turning it into a drama.

Charlie disappeared behind the curtain with the mock-up folded over his arm. The lock clicked a moment later—sharp, decisive.

The room waited in the way a room waits when a task has moved into a private phase. Not awkward. Just… contained.

Mara didn’t fill the time with chatter. She began sorting the reed lengths by stiffness, bending each one with her fingers, assessing it the way you assess timber.

“Do you think he’ll manage?” I asked quietly.

Mara didn’t look up. “He’ll manage. He’ll also want to be perfect. That’s the part that will trip him.”

A faint rustle came from behind the curtain, then the sound of a breath let out slowly—controlled, not panicked.

Mara added, almost as an afterthought, “And if anyone in this place ever makes him into a story, I’ll have them out on their ear.”

It wasn’t a threat. It was policy.

I felt my shoulders loosen a fraction. It was strange, the way a boundary could calm a whole room.

Charlie emerged after a few minutes, mock-up on, laced loosely enough that it didn’t demand a performance. Over his clothes, still clearly a work garment rather than a transformation. Mara had been exact about that, too: *no theatre.*

Charlie stood stiffly at first, chin slightly raised as though he were bracing for judgement.

Mara didn’t give him judgement. She gave him tasks.

“Arms up,” she said.

Charlie lifted his arms.

The top edge of the mock-up shifted, the canvas flattening in some places, fighting in others. I watched the material as if it were a diagram drawn in real time. Near the left side-back, the seam line pulled, the stress gathering like a storm behind a ridge.

Mara’s eyes sharpened.

“Now reach forward. Like you’re taking something off a high shelf.”

Charlie did.

The left tie point dragged. You could *see* the load path trying to relocate, looking for the easiest way out. The lacing tugged, the fabric creased into a diagonal that wasn’t elegant—it was warning.

Mara stepped closer, not touching him, but close enough to see the truth of it.

“Do you feel that?” she asked.

Charlie nodded, jaw tight. “Yes.”

“Don’t give me ‘yes’,” Mara snapped, and Charlie startled. “I don’t care about polite. Tell me **where.**”

Charlie blinked, then forced his mind into the technical. “At the left waist tie. It’s pulling. It’s… it’s taking too much.”

“Good,” Mara said immediately, as if the moment he described the reality he’d stepped back into safety. “Now bend. Like you’re lifting a tray.”

Charlie bent carefully, and the top edge tried to roll.

It wasn’t dramatic. It was worse than dramatic—subtle. The kind of failure a costume could hide for ten minutes and then betray you on day one of actual work.

I saw Charlie’s expression shift—an involuntary flicker of disappointment.

Then, almost as quickly: relief.

As if part of him had been afraid the garment would behave “fine,” and he’d be expected to pretend that meant it *was* fine.

Mara saw that too.

“Write,” she said. “Before your feelings invent a different story.”

Charlie moved to the table and wrote with his pen still slightly shaking.

**MOVEMENT / STRESS:** overhead reach, forward reach, bend/lift simulation
**FAILURE POINTS:** left waist tie load concentration; top edge roll; diagonal crease from left waist toward side-back; seam stress side-back left

Mara watched him write, then leaned in.

“Now,” she said. “Tell me what you think it means.”

Charlie opened his mouth, then shut it. He looked down at the entry as if the paper might supply the answer if he stared hard enough.

“I think the tie point is wrong,” he said finally. “Or not… supported enough. It’s acting like an anchor for everything.”

Mara nodded. “Load path. Good. And the roll?”

Charlie frowned. “The top edge is fighting torque. It’s… it’s being dragged by the lacing, isn’t it? If the tension is uneven, the edge wants to curl because it’s trying to accommodate the pull.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to me, not for approval—more like *see? this is why we trained him.* Then she looked back to Charlie.

“And the side-back seam?”

Charlie’s pen tapped the paper once. “It’s underbuilt. If it’s going to be working stays, that seam needs to expect repeated bend. It needs reinforcement, or a different seam finish. The fabric’s telling us where it wants more structure.”

Mara straightened. “Good.”

Charlie looked up, uncertain, almost waiting for the other shoe.

Mara didn’t drop one. She simply moved on.

“Attempt one has served its purpose,” she said. “Now we do attempt two.”

Charlie’s shoulders sank with the weight of it, and then he lifted them again, deliberately, as if he were choosing not to collapse.

Mara slid a narrow strip of twill tape toward him. “This goes here.” She pointed to the area he’d described. “Secondary anchor. Spread the load. And we move the tie point.”

“How much?” Charlie asked.

Mara shrugged. “Twelve millimetres to start. It’s not magic. It’s iteration.”

Charlie wrote: **FIX APPLIED (PROPOSED): move tie point 12mm; add secondary anchor tape; reinforce side-back seam; adjust top edge binding cut**

Mara watched him write the word *proposed.*

“Good,” she said. “That word keeps you honest.”

Charlie paused, then spoke softly, as if he were stepping onto thin ice. “Mara?”

“Yes,” she said, brisk.

“If—” He stopped, then tried again, less polite and more clear. “If we’re going to do this properly… I need the same privacy each time.”

Mara’s eyes didn’t soften. They sharpened.

“Of course you do,” she said. “And you’ll get it. But don’t ask like it’s a favour.”

Charlie swallowed. “Then how do I ask?”

Mara leaned in, close enough that the room seemed to narrow to just the two of them.

“You state conditions,” she said. “You don’t plead for permission. This is work. Work has conditions.”

Charlie nodded, the smallest hint of steadiness returning.

“State them,” Mara said.

Charlie drew a breath. “Door locked. Curtain closed. Nobody enters. Nobody talks about it. Log stays factual. Fitting times are scheduled. And—” He hesitated, then forced the last one out. “No surprises.”

Mara’s mouth tightened, not unkindly. “Good.”

She turned to me. “Write that as policy.”

I picked up the pen and wrote it under the ledger entry, in my own hand, because I understood the point: if the standard lived only in Mara’s mouth, it could still be treated as personality. If it lived on paper, it became infrastructure.

**POLICY:** Fittings for prototype testing are scheduled; privacy maintained; no unscheduled access; documentation is factual; no commentary.

Mara nodded once.

Then she did something small that might have looked like nothing to anyone else: she put her palm flat on the ledger page, pressing it down as if to set the ink into the paper.

“This,” she said, “is how we keep the place clean.”

Charlie looked at the page. Not at Mara. Not at me. At the page.

It was the first time I’d seen him look at authority with something like trust.

He let out a slow breath and—almost imperceptibly—his posture eased.

Mara clapped her hands once.

“Right,” she said. “Take it off. Don’t baby it. It’s a mock-up. It’s allowed to be ugly.”

Charlie nodded and disappeared behind the curtain again.

The lock clicked.

Mara began sorting the pattern pieces into a new pile. “Attempt two starts now,” she called, not unkindly, not asking whether he had energy, simply assuming he had professionalism.

I stood there with the ledger open and felt, again, that odd sensation—like watching something grow roots.

This wasn’t a story about a boy in women’s clothes. That story was cheap, and this place would not host it.

This was a story about a garment that demanded the truth.

And a room full of women—sharp, competent, unromantic—who knew how to turn truth into a system.

When Charlie came back out, mock-up folded under his arm, he didn’t look embarrassed.

He looked… focused.

He picked up the chalk without being told.

“Attempt two,” he said quietly, to himself as much as to anyone.

Mara’s eyes flicked up, and in them was a kind of satisfaction that didn’t need praise.

“Now,” she said, “you’re making stays.”
