# Celeste Meets Charlie

## POV-Celeste

When I came out of the stall in the loo, I was a bit surprised to see Amanda at the sinks, washing her hands. Amanda has this thing for blokey shirts — always has — and from behind, she could easily be mistaken for a lad. Which was something I found attractive about her: so cool, that boyishness. Her smell, too... and her warmth. But her bum, well, that was all girl. Yes, she possessed a blokish energy, but her boyishness was contradicted by her bottom.

I approached her, puzzled. Earlier, when I had suggested we go "powder our noses" she'd shrugged. Not-interested.

## Celeste — Trust Test Two (Discretion)

Wardrobe has its own weather.

Outside, the Faire was waking properly now—voices lifting, hammer taps, the first laugh of someone who’d already decided the day would go their way. Inside, we lived in a quieter climate: fabric whisper, drawers sliding, the soft puncture of pins finding their place. The kind of work that looks like nothing until it fails.

Charlie moved through it like someone learning a new language without daring to mispronounce. He kept his hands clean without being reminded. He didn’t apologise. Not once since the waistcoat errand. I’d heard him swallow it twice—felt it in the tiny pause before he chose silence instead. That was progress.

Mara, unfortunately, noticed progress the way some people notice a new smell: with suspicion.

She’d stationed herself at the cutting table with a pile of stockings and an expression that suggested stockings were beneath her. Another woman—Jodie, one of the performers—had come in for a fit check and then stayed too long, leaning in the doorway as if Wardrobe were a café.

I was at the central table, inventory open, making the day’s problems into lists. Charlie was sorting linen ties by length, methodical, lips moving slightly as he counted. If he kept this up, he’d become dangerous—competent in a room where competence is rare.

Jodie’s voice drifted, casual and unkind in that “girl talk” way that pretends it isn’t a weapon. “I’m telling you, she can’t keep wearing the stays from last season. They’re… not happening.”

Mara made a sound of agreement. “Oh, I know. I said to her, darling, it’s not the garment, it’s the *geometry.* But you can’t say that, can you.”

Jodie laughed. “She’s going to pop a seam in front of the patrons. I’d pay to see it.”

Charlie’s counting slowed. Not much. Just a half-beat. But I saw it.

He kept his eyes on the ties as if they were suddenly fascinating.

I didn’t look up. I didn’t give the conversation oxygen by reacting. This, too, was part of my test. People behave differently when they think you’re listening.

Mara continued, voice dropping into that syrupy intimacy that always means cruelty. “And she’s got the nerve to complain her bodice scratches. I’m like—of course it scratches, love. It’s trying to escape.”

Another laugh.

I watched Charlie’s hands.

He didn’t stiffen. He didn’t smile. He didn’t glance up to see if I’d heard. He simply… tightened his grip on the linen ties for one moment, then deliberately loosened it, as if reminding his own fingers to be gentle.

Good.

A boy with the wrong instincts would have leaned into this. Would have used it to purchase belonging—shared mockery as currency. Even a sweet boy might have tried to be “helpful” in the worst way: offering sympathy to Jodie, making the performer’s body into a story.

Charlie did neither.

He went still inside himself. He became careful.

That was worth more than charm.

Jodie drifted away eventually, satisfied she’d deposited her poison. Mara returned to her stockings with an expression that said she’d improved the world.

Charlie finished his count and looked up, uncertain, as if he’d been holding his breath.

I kept my face neutral. Then I said, lightly, “How many?”

He blinked at the normal question, relief flashing across his eyes. “Forty-six ties. Twelve short, twenty-two medium, twelve long.”

“Good,” I said. “Put the long ones in drawer B, label the bundle. Don’t guess on the missing count—write it down.”

He nodded and stood, moving to the drawers.

Mara watched him go, then turned her gaze on me as if I’d just brought a stray animal into her kitchen. “You’re making him your pet project.”

“I’m making him useful,” I corrected, without looking up from the inventory.

Mara’s mouth twisted. “He’s a boy. They get weird.”

“They get weird when you teach them to,” I said, and then finally looked at her. “We’re not doing that here.”

Her eyes narrowed. “Who’s ‘we’?”

I let my voice stay calm. “We is Wardrobe. We is the line between bodies and spectacle. We don’t make someone’s laces into entertainment.”

Mara snorted softly. “You’re so serious.”

“Yes,” I agreed. “That’s why the patrons don’t see our failures.”

She held my gaze for a beat, then looked away first, annoyed at herself.

Good.

Charlie returned to the table and sat down again, posture straighter than before. The ties were sorted. The label was neat. He’d done exactly what I asked.

I waited until the room was quiet again—the door closed, Mara busy, no witnesses who would mistake this moment for softness.

Then I said, “Charlie.”

He looked up immediately.

“Did you hear what they were saying earlier?” I asked, mild.

His eyes widened just enough to betray him. Then he lowered his gaze, careful. “Yes.”

“And?” I prompted.

He swallowed. I could see his old reflex trying to please, to answer in a way that would make me approve. He could have condemned Mara. He could have joined her. He could have tried to be noble.

Instead, he said something much better.

“It wasn’t… about the clothes,” he said quietly.

I paused. “Go on.”

He hesitated. “It was about… her. About making her… a joke.”

The words came slowly, as if he was testing each one for correctness.

“And what did you do?” I asked.

Charlie’s mouth opened, then shut. He seemed genuinely puzzled by the question. “Nothing.”

“Exactly,” I said.

He looked up, startled, as if the word had struck him.

I leaned back slightly, watching him. “That was the test.”

His face flushed. Not with pride. With the sudden awareness of having been seen.

“I—” His mouth shaped itself toward apology again. He caught it, eyes widening, and rerouted. “…Okay.”

“Good,” I said, because good is clean. “Now listen carefully.”

He did.

“This room doesn’t punish people for having bodies,” I said. “It supports bodies so people can do their jobs. That’s all. When someone tries to turn a body into gossip, you don’t participate. You don’t comfort them. You don’t lecture them. You simply don’t make it your story.”

Charlie nodded, and I watched the idea settle into him like a weight he was relieved to carry. Not moral grandstanding. Practical rule.

“Understood,” he said.

I held his gaze for one beat longer than necessary.

Then I stood.

The next part mattered: upgrading him without ceremony. Treating respect as normal, because that was the frame I wanted to set.

I crossed to the women’s rail.

Charlie’s eyes flicked away automatically, as if he’d been told, somewhere in life, that he was not permitted to look.

I didn’t correct him. Not yet. This wasn’t about forcing him into anything. This was about teaching him that objects aren’t shameful.

I pulled out a petticoat—plain cotton, not lace, not a fetish object, nothing theatrical. Just a garment that had done its work and needed care. A seam along the hem had started to loosen, and there was a small tear where someone’s shoe had caught it.

I brought it back to the table and placed it down gently. Not dramatically. Like a towel.

Charlie looked at it and went still.

I said, briskly, “Wash your hands again.”

He blinked. “I just did.”

“I know,” I said. “Do it anyway.”

He stood and did it immediately, no questions, no sulking. When he returned, he held his hands out for a moment, then lowered them, remembering I didn’t want performances.

I pointed to the petticoat. “This needs a hem repair. Small stitch. Flat. Strong. The wearer has to walk all day in it.”

Charlie’s eyes stayed on the fabric. He looked as if he expected his own thoughts to betray him.

“Celeste,” he said, low, and then stopped, as if he wasn’t sure he was allowed to say my name in that tone.

“What?” I asked.

He swallowed. “I don’t… want to mess it up.”

That wasn’t fear of women’s clothing. That was respect. The right kind.

“Then you won’t,” I said. “Because you’re going to treat it like it’s alive.”

He nodded.

And then, because I wanted to make the basso continuo explicit without turning it into a sermon, I added one line—quiet and final.

“This isn’t intimate,” I said. “It’s important.”

Charlie looked up at me, and something in his expression loosened—like a knot untied. He nodded once, deeply. “Okay.”

He picked up the petticoat with both hands and laid it flat. He didn’t pinch it. He didn’t fumble. He handled it like fabric that mattered.

Mara, of course, chose that moment to glance over.

Her eyes widened slightly. Her mouth tightened in anticipation of commentary. I didn’t look at her. I didn’t give her the stage.

Charlie threaded the needle with the same concentrated care as before. His hands trembled less now. He began the hem repair slowly, stitch by stitch, building a line that would hold.

I watched him for a minute.

He wasn’t fascinated.

He was focused.

That distinction mattered so much it felt like relief in my own chest.

When the stitch line reached the tear, he paused and adjusted the fabric so the repair would distribute strain rather than create a new weak point. That wasn’t something you did by instinct. That was someone who understood pressure and failure and how to prevent both.

He looked up. “Is… this right?”

I leaned in and examined it closely. The work was neat. The hem lay flat. The tension was correct.

“Yes,” I said. “Carry on.”

He did.

Mara muttered, barely audible, “Well, I’ll be.”

I didn’t respond. I didn’t need to. Results do their own speaking if you let them.

Charlie finished the repair and smoothed the fabric gently, like calming a living thing. He held it up to the light, checking for puckers, for unevenness, for any sign he’d been careless.

Then he looked at me, waiting.

I gave him what I always gave when something mattered: the smallest possible acknowledgement.

A nod.

His shoulders loosened as if someone had slipped a strap off his chest. He exhaled—quietly, as though even breathing was something he didn’t want to do wrong.

And in that exhale I heard the shape of the new trust forming: not blind obedience, not romance, not worship.

A practical belief.

When I said something was important, he treated it that way.

When I said something was normal, he stopped being afraid of it.

That kind of trust can be tested. It can be strengthened. It can be used.

I turned back to my clipboard and made one small mark beside his name—nothing dramatic, just a private notation in the system I was building.

**Upgrade.**

Then, without looking up, I slid the next task toward him: a bundle of linen and a small tin of buttons.

“Next,” I said. “We’re going to stop things failing before they fail.”

Charlie’s fingers closed around the bundle.

And this time, he didn’t glance toward the door.

He didn’t need an exit.

He had a role. He had rules.

And he had me—steady, purposeful, unreadable—setting the tempo he’d begun to match without realising he’d started.
