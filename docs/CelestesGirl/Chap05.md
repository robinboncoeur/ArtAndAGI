# Celeste Meets Charlie

## POV-Celeste

When I came out of the stall in the loo, I was a bit surprised to see Amanda at the sinks, washing her hands. Amanda has this thing for blokey shirts — always has — and from behind, she could easily be mistaken for a lad. Which was something I found attractive about her: so cool, that boyishness. Her smell, too... and her warmth. But her bum, well, that was all girl. Yes, she possessed a blokish energy, but her boyishness was contradicted by her bottom.

I approached her, puzzled. Earlier, when I had suggested we go "powder our noses" she'd shrugged. Not-interested.

## Celeste — Trust Test Two (Discretion)

Wardrobe has its own weather.

Outside, the Faire was waking properly now—voices lifting, hammer taps, the first laugh of someone who’d already decided the day would go their way. Inside, we lived in a quieter climate: fabric whisper, drawers sliding, the soft puncture of pins finding their place. The kind of work that looks like nothing until it fails.

Charlie moved through it like someone learning a new language without daring to mispronounce. He kept his hands clean without being reminded. He didn’t apologise. Not once since the waistcoat errand. I’d heard him swallow it twice—felt it in the tiny pause before he chose silence instead. That was progress.

Mara, unfortunately, noticed progress the way some people notice a new smell: with suspicion.

She’d stationed herself at the cutting table with a pile of stockings and an expression that suggested stockings were beneath her. Another woman—Jodie, one of the performers—had come in for a fit check and then stayed too long, leaning in the doorway as if Wardrobe were a café.

I was at the central table, inventory open, making the day’s problems into lists. Charlie was sorting linen ties by length, methodical, lips moving slightly as he counted. If he kept this up, he’d become dangerous—competent in a room where competence is rare.

Jodie’s voice drifted, casual and unkind in that “girl talk” way that pretends it isn’t a weapon. “I’m telling you, she can’t keep wearing the stays from last season. They’re… not happening.”

Mara made a sound of agreement. “Oh, I know. I said to her, darling, it’s not the garment, it’s the *geometry.* But you can’t say that, can you.”

Jodie laughed. “She’s going to pop a seam in front of the patrons. I’d pay to see it.”

Charlie’s counting slowed. Not much. Just a half-beat. But I saw it.

He kept his eyes on the ties as if they were suddenly fascinating.

I didn’t look up. I didn’t give the conversation oxygen by reacting. This, too, was part of my test. People behave differently when they think you’re listening.

Mara continued, voice dropping into that syrupy intimacy that always means cruelty. “And she’s got the nerve to complain her bodice scratches. I’m like—of course it scratches, love. It’s trying to escape.”

Another laugh.

I watched Charlie’s hands.

He didn’t stiffen. He didn’t smile. He didn’t glance up to see if I’d heard. He simply… tightened his grip on the linen ties for one moment, then deliberately loosened it, as if reminding his own fingers to be gentle.

Good.

A boy with the wrong instincts would have leaned into this. Would have used it to purchase belonging—shared mockery as currency. Even a sweet boy might have tried to be “helpful” in the worst way: offering sympathy to Jodie, making the performer’s body into a story.

Charlie did neither.

He went still inside himself. He became careful.

That was worth more than charm.

Jodie drifted away eventually, satisfied she’d deposited her poison. Mara returned to her stockings with an expression that said she’d improved the world.

Charlie finished his count and looked up, uncertain, as if he’d been holding his breath.

I kept my face neutral. Then I said, lightly, “How many?”

He blinked at the normal question, relief flashing across his eyes. “Forty-six ties. Twelve short, twenty-two medium, twelve long.”

“Good,” I said. “Put the long ones in drawer B, label the bundle. Don’t guess on the missing count—write it down.”

He nodded and stood, moving to the drawers.

Mara watched him go, then turned her gaze on me as if I’d just brought a stray animal into her kitchen. “You’re making him your pet project.”

“I’m making him useful,” I corrected, without looking up from the inventory.

Mara’s mouth twisted. “He’s a boy. They get weird.”

“They get weird when you teach them to,” I said, and then finally looked at her. “We’re not doing that here.”

Her eyes narrowed. “Who’s ‘we’?”

I let my voice stay calm. “We is Wardrobe. We is the line between bodies and spectacle. We don’t make someone’s laces into entertainment.”

Mara snorted softly. “You’re so serious.”

“Yes,” I agreed. “That’s why the patrons don’t see our failures.”

She held my gaze for a beat, then looked away first, annoyed at herself.

Good.

Charlie returned to the table and sat down again, posture straighter than before. The ties were sorted. The label was neat. He’d done exactly what I asked.

I waited until the room was quiet again—the door closed, Mara busy, no witnesses who would mistake this moment for softness.

Then I said, “Charlie.”

He looked up immediately.

“Did you hear what they were saying earlier?” I asked, mild.

His eyes widened just enough to betray him. Then he lowered his gaze, careful. “Yes.”

“And?” I prompted.

He swallowed. I could see his old reflex trying to please, to answer in a way that would make me approve. He could have condemned Mara. He could have joined her. He could have tried to be noble.

Instead, he said something much better.

“It wasn’t… about the clothes,” he said quietly.

I paused. “Go on.”

He hesitated. “It was about… her. About making her… a joke.”

The words came slowly, as if he was testing each one for correctness.

“And what did you do?” I asked.

Charlie’s mouth opened, then shut. He seemed genuinely puzzled by the question. “Nothing.”

“Exactly,” I said.

He looked up, startled, as if the word had struck him.

I leaned back slightly, watching him. “That was the test.”

His face flushed. Not with pride. With the sudden awareness of having been seen.

“I—” His mouth shaped itself toward apology again. He caught it, eyes widening, and rerouted. “…Okay.”

“Good,” I said, because good is clean. “Now listen carefully.”

He did.

“This room doesn’t punish people for having bodies,” I said. “It supports bodies so people can do their jobs. That’s all. When someone tries to turn a body into gossip, you don’t participate. You don’t comfort them. You don’t lecture them. You simply don’t make it your story.”

Charlie nodded, and I watched the idea settle into him like a weight he was relieved to carry. Not moral grandstanding. Practical rule.

“Understood,” he said.

I held his gaze for one beat longer than necessary.

Then I stood.

The next part mattered: upgrading him without ceremony. Treating respect as normal, because that was the frame I wanted to set.

I crossed to the women’s rail.

Charlie’s eyes flicked away automatically, as if he’d been told, somewhere in life, that he was not permitted to look.

I didn’t correct him. Not yet. This wasn’t about forcing him into anything. This was about teaching him that objects aren’t shameful.

I pulled out a petticoat—plain cotton, not lace, not a fetish object, nothing theatrical. Just a garment that had done its work and needed care. A seam along the hem had started to loosen, and there was a small tear where someone’s shoe had caught it.

I brought it back to the table and placed it down gently. Not dramatically. Like a towel.

Charlie looked at it and went still.

I said, briskly, “Wash your hands again.”

He blinked. “I just did.”

“I know,” I said. “Do it anyway.”

He stood and did it immediately, no questions, no sulking. When he returned, he held his hands out for a moment, then lowered them, remembering I didn’t want performances.

I pointed to the petticoat. “This needs a hem repair. Small stitch. Flat. Strong. The wearer has to walk all day in it.”

Charlie’s eyes stayed on the fabric. He looked as if he expected his own thoughts to betray him.

“Celeste,” he said, low, and then stopped, as if he wasn’t sure he was allowed to say my name in that tone.

“What?” I asked.

He swallowed. “I don’t… want to mess it up.”

That wasn’t fear of women’s clothing. That was respect. The right kind.

“Then you won’t,” I said. “Because you’re going to treat it like it’s alive.”

He nodded.

And then, because I wanted to make the basso continuo explicit without turning it into a sermon, I added one line—quiet and final.

“This isn’t intimate,” I said. “It’s important.”

Charlie looked up at me, and something in his expression loosened—like a knot untied. He nodded once, deeply. “Okay.”

He picked up the petticoat with both hands and laid it flat. He didn’t pinch it. He didn’t fumble. He handled it like fabric that mattered.

Mara, of course, chose that moment to glance over.

Her eyes widened slightly. Her mouth tightened in anticipation of commentary. I didn’t look at her. I didn’t give her the stage.

Charlie threaded the needle with the same concentrated care as before. His hands trembled less now. He began the hem repair slowly, stitch by stitch, building a line that would hold.

I watched him for a minute.

He wasn’t fascinated.

He was focused.

That distinction mattered so much it felt like relief in my own chest.

When the stitch line reached the tear, he paused and adjusted the fabric so the repair would distribute strain rather than create a new weak point. That wasn’t something you did by instinct. That was someone who understood pressure and failure and how to prevent both.

He looked up. “Is… this right?”

I leaned in and examined it closely. The work was neat. The hem lay flat. The tension was correct.

“Yes,” I said. “Carry on.”

He did.

Mara muttered, barely audible, “Well, I’ll be.”

I didn’t respond. I didn’t need to. Results do their own speaking if you let them.

Charlie finished the repair and smoothed the fabric gently, like calming a living thing. He held it up to the light, checking for puckers, for unevenness, for any sign he’d been careless.

Then he looked at me, waiting.

I gave him what I always gave when something mattered: the smallest possible acknowledgement.

A nod.

His shoulders loosened as if someone had slipped a strap off his chest. He exhaled—quietly, as though even breathing was something he didn’t want to do wrong.

And in that exhale I heard the shape of the new trust forming: not blind obedience, not romance, not worship.

A practical belief.

When I said something was important, he treated it that way.

When I said something was normal, he stopped being afraid of it.

That kind of trust can be tested. It can be strengthened. It can be used.

I turned back to my clipboard and made one small mark beside his name—nothing dramatic, just a private notation in the system I was building.

**Upgrade.**

Then, without looking up, I slid the next task toward him: a bundle of linen and a small tin of buttons.

“Next,” I said. “We’re going to stop things failing before they fail.”

Charlie’s fingers closed around the bundle.

And this time, he didn’t glance toward the door.

He didn’t need an exit.

He had a role. He had rules.

And he had me—steady, purposeful, unreadable—setting the tempo he’d begun to match without realising he’d started.


<hr style="height:8px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:blue">























We’re absolutely on the same page — and you’re right to pull me up.

What I wrote *works as a scene*, but it doesn’t cohere with **your established logistics**:

* **Celeste has graduated** → she can’t be in the room.
* So the school incident must arrive to her **second-hand** (anecdote / rumour / clip / a teacher’s email / a student’s text), and the real “onstage” action is **Charlie’s quiet decision + his arrival at Wardrobe** and how Celeste (and Mara) handle it without turning into rescuers.

Also: yes — this becomes **Scene Five** in your numbering. Scene Four is Wardrobe trial shift. Scene Five is the school rupture, told from Celeste’s remove.

Below is a Scene Five draft that does exactly that: *school incident arrives as collateral*, and the emotional weight lives in Charlie’s controlled exit and the women’s professional response.

---

## Scene Five — *The day the school spits him out*

*(Celeste POV, off-campus; Wardrobe now functioning as a growing atelier)*

Wardrobe didn’t feel like a refuge anymore.

Not today.

The rails were fuller, the worktable was cleared for pattern paper instead of mending baskets, and Mara had the particular expression she wore when money had been approved and time had not: a brisk concentration that made everyone else move faster without being told to.

A new jacket lay pinned to a mannequin — not perfect yet, but already smarter than the old stock. The seam lines made sense. The stress points had been thought through. It was the first garment in weeks that didn’t feel like a compromise.

Mara stood with a pencil behind her ear, looking at it like she was deciding whether to forgive it.

“See that?” she said to me, tapping a point near the underarm. “That’s where tourists tear things. That’s where staff tear things. Movement there is violent.”

“It’s not violent,” I said.

Mara’s eyes didn’t leave the seam. “It is if you pretend bodies don’t exist.”

That was Mara’s entire philosophy in one sentence. Design as honesty. Sewing as physics. Safety as something you built.

I was about to reply when my phone buzzed in my pocket — twice in quick succession, as if whoever it was didn’t trust politeness to be heard.

I didn’t check it immediately. I’d learned not to flinch in this room. Mara hated flinching more than she hated mistakes.

The third buzz came, insistent.

Mara glanced at me without turning her head. “If it’s school, I don’t care.”

“It isn’t,” I said, already pulling the phone out.

It was a message from Leah — one of the girls still at school, the kind who liked gossip until it had teeth.

**Leah:**
*Charlie walked out of class.*
*Like… just left. Mr G tried to stop him.*
*Everyone was laughing. I swear someone filmed it.*
*He was at the board and Mr G said something about staff saying Charlie won’t make it through the year. Like staffroom stuff. Charlie went white.*

I read it once, then again.

Mara watched my face the way she watched a hemline — waiting for the tell.

I didn’t give her much. I didn’t want to. But a message like that doesn’t land quietly. It lands like a dropped tool.

I typed back with one hand.

**Me:**
*Where is he now?*

Leah replied almost instantly.

**Leah:**
*No idea. He just… disappeared. Didn’t even slam the door. It was creepy. Like he wasn’t even angry. Just… done.*

Done.

I stared at the word longer than I needed to.

Mara’s voice came, flat. “What happened.”

Not a question. A demand for facts.

I looked up. “School happened.”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “That’s not an answer.”

I put the phone down on the table, screen facing me, as if turning it outward would make it gossip. “He was made to go up to the board. Greeves. And Greeves — who’s meant to be the decent one — let slip that other teachers think Charlie won’t make it. The room laughed. Someone filmed it. Charlie walked out.”

Mara’s expression didn’t change much. But something in her eyes cooled.

“That idiot,” she said, very softly.

“Mara—”

“No,” Mara cut in, and her voice sharpened the air. “Don’t defend him. A teacher’s job is to control the room. If he can’t control it, he doesn’t get to use a boy as an example.”

She turned back to the mannequin and tapped the underarm point again, harder this time.

“This,” she said, “is why you reinforce. Because stress finds weakness. Always.”

I understood what she meant: not just fabric.

I reached for my phone again, thumb hovering. I could call Charlie. I could text him. I could drive to his house.

And then I saw it as clearly as if Mara had said it: **don’t chase him like he’s a lost child.** Not now. Not if we wanted him to keep the dignity of his own decision.

So I did the only thing that felt like control: I waited.

Wardrobe went on around us — steam, pins, scissors, the low murmur of women working. It should have soothed me. It didn’t. It made the contrast sharper. Here, competence earned you space. At school, competence only made you a target if you were already marked as “wrong.”

Mara went to the cutting table and spread out pattern paper with a decisive sweep. “Get the measurements list,” she said, brisk. “We’re not stopping.”

“Right,” I said, and reached for the clipboard.

A few minutes later, the door opened.

Not a dramatic entrance.

Just the door, and the click of it closing again.

I looked up and saw Charlie standing inside Wardrobe with his backpack on one shoulder.

He didn’t look dishevelled. He didn’t look tear-streaked. He hadn’t come in with the raw face of a boy begging for comfort.

He looked… set.

Like a nail driven into wood.

His gaze swept the room once — rails, tables, Mara — and then landed on me for a fraction of a second before flicking away again, as if eye contact was not the point of this visit.

Mara spoke first. Of course she did.

“Rossignol,” she said. Not unkind. Not warm. Just naming him into the room.

Charlie nodded. “Mara.”

Mara’s eyebrow lifted. Tiny, approving. He’d used her name correctly. Not “ma’am,” not “Miss,” not apology. Adult-to-adult.

Charlie swallowed once. “I’m not going back.”

The words were quiet. They didn’t ask permission. They didn’t invite a debate.

They were an announcement.

The room seemed to pause around it. Even the steamer hiss sounded restrained.

Mara didn’t react like a counsellor. She reacted like a manager.

“To where,” she said, “are you not going back.”

Charlie’s jaw moved. He didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on a point near Mara’s shoulder, as if meeting her gaze directly might turn it into a confrontation.

“School,” he said. “I’m done.”

Mara’s expression didn’t soften. But it did sharpen with clarity, as if this was a problem she could finally name.

“And what are you proposing,” she said, “instead.”

Charlie breathed in — slow, controlled. He adjusted the strap of his backpack with one hand, a small grounding motion.

“I can work,” he said. “Here. Properly. Not… hanging around.”

That was Charlie, at his best: not melodrama, not entitlement, not “please save me.”

An offer.

A willingness to be useful.

My chest tightened anyway, because I could hear the underside of it: *I won’t be laughed at again. I won’t be filmed. I won’t be a spectacle. I’d rather stitch until my fingers bleed.*

Mara stared at him for a beat.

Then she said, “You don’t get to make big decisions in a panic.”

Charlie’s mouth tightened. “I’m not panicking.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Everyone else panics loudly. You panic by disappearing.”

Charlie held still. He didn’t deny it. He didn’t argue.

He simply said, very evenly, “I left.”

Mara’s gaze pinned him — not cruel, not tender. Accurate.

“Yes,” Mara said. “You left. Good. That’s self-respect.”

Charlie’s eyes flicked up, startled — because he’d expected punishment, not acknowledgement.

Mara continued without letting the moment get sentimental.

“But self-respect isn’t a plan,” she said. “And I don’t run a charity.”

“I know,” Charlie said quickly.

Mara’s tone stayed flat. “Then listen. This place is changing.”

I saw Charlie’s gaze shift to the pattern paper, the mannequin, the new garment pinned in place. He’d noticed. He wasn’t stupid.

Mara stepped aside and gestured at the room with two fingers.

“This is not a mending corner anymore,” she said. “It’s a studio. It is deadlines. It is standards. It is money. If you want to be here full-time, you work like a professional. You don’t come here to hide.”

Charlie swallowed. “I’m not hiding.”

Mara’s mouth twitched, almost a smile. “Good. Because I will know.”

Then — and this was Mara’s version of generosity — she gave him something he could grab onto.

“Today,” Mara said, “you do two things. You finish the reinforcement on the prototype jacket. And you inventory the closure stock. Every hook, every eyelet, every tape. Write it down cleanly. If you do it properly, you can come back tomorrow.”

Charlie went still. Not with fear. With the stunned relief of someone being given a rule-set instead of an argument.

“Okay,” he said.

I hadn’t spoken yet. I was letting Mara set the terms. That mattered. It kept this from becoming about my feelings.

But Charlie’s eyes flicked to me again, quick and involuntary, and I could see the question he didn’t want to ask: *Are you going to make me go back?*

I answered without answering.

I picked up the clipboard and placed it on the table beside him.

“Start with the closures,” I said, voice neutral. “You’re fast when you’re calm.”

His shoulders loosened by a fraction. He nodded once and reached for the stock drawer.

Mara watched him begin, then turned to me, low enough that it wasn’t for him.

“This is going to become a fight,” she murmured.

“With the school,” I said.

“With everyone,” Mara replied. “Because people love the idea of a system until a person refuses to be ground down by it.”

I glanced at Charlie. He’d already opened the drawer and was laying out tapes with the quiet precision of someone who could cope if the task stayed honest.

I kept my voice low. “He didn’t make a scene.”

Mara’s gaze stayed on him. “No. He made a decision.”

Charlie, as if sensing he was being discussed, lifted his head slightly, eyes darting between us.

I didn’t soften. I didn’t reassure.

I said, simply, “You can do this. But you do it properly.”

Charlie swallowed, then nodded again.

“Yes,” he said. “Properly.”

And just like that, the story shifted.

Not into rescue.

Into work.

Into responsibility.

Into the next room.

---

If you like this, the next scene (Scene Six) can be the **first “atelier-pressure day”** where it becomes clear to Charlie that Wardrobe isn’t a nest anymore — it’s a workplace — and his self-respect will now be tested not by ridicule, but by *standard and speed*.


<hr style="height:25px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:blue">





















At this stage, Emily, I think we've got the following situation:
* Charlie is now fully engaged at Wardrobe, out of the academic environment *safely*
* Mum is largely onboard, still concerned about Charlie's outlook, largely unaware of her son's infatuation with Celeste, which had been a driving factor to Charlie being in Wardrobe in the first place
* Celeste and Mara are building a business: woman-focused, strengths-acknowledging

Charlie becomes increasingly involved in "New Design Realisation". Celeste and Mara discover a period design, they recreate it, turn it into a reality. They quickly realise that the testing phase needs more than just someone wearing an item: that person needs to understand construction, stress points, have the ability to devise solutions. They realise this means ... Charlie.

---

{Emily}  
Yes. That’s a crisp, coherent state-of-play — and what you’ve just articulated gives you a *beautiful* engine for the next movement: Charlie doesn’t “earn belonging” through emotional acceptance; he earns it through **indispensability** in a women-led enterprise.

And the design-realisation/testing insight is spot-on. In a real atelier (especially one making garments for working staff), “testing” isn’t *wearing*, it’s **interrogating**:

* Where does it bind?
* Where does it tear?
* Which seam is doing too much work?
* Which closure fails when you’re sweaty, rushed, or grabbed?
* How do you strengthen without adding bulk?
* How do you reinforce without losing silhouette?

That is Charlie’s brain. Not in a cute way. In a *structural* way.

### Thematic bonus

This shift also keeps your lane narrow and rewarding:

* **Mara** remains the standard-setter and gatekeeper of safety.
* **Celeste** remains the historian/researcher and direction-setter.
* **Charlie** becomes the “engineering mind” that translates research into garments that survive reality.

It’s still women leading. Charlie is *useful* in their framework, not directing it.

---

## How to stage this discovery so it lands (and doesn’t feel like “Charlie is the secret genius who saves the girls”)

Make it so the women *already* know the design and build the first prototype — and it’s good — but it fails in a way that only shows up under real movement.

### The key: the failure isn’t “they did it wrong”

It’s “the world is harsher than the drawing.”

So:

1. Celeste and Mara research and draft.
2. They build Prototype 1.
3. A staff member wears it. It looks gorgeous. Everyone’s thrilled.
4. Then: tear. Pull. Gape. A seam fails not from incompetence, but from *use*.

Mara’s reaction is not embarrassment; it’s professional irritation:

> “Of course it fails. It’s never the sitting that breaks things. It’s the day.”

Celeste is frustrated but analytic:

> “The extant garment wouldn’t have survived this kind of labour.”

And then the realisation:

> We need a tester who *thinks in seams*.

Not a model. A translator.

That’s Charlie.

---

## Your next scene: “The first true test” (what it should *do*)

This scene should:

* show Charlie’s **value** without turning him into the hero,
* deepen his place in the women’s competence network,
* and quietly heighten his feelings for Celeste without naming them.

### A strong structure for Scene Ten

**Location:** Wardrobe, late afternoon. The room is alive: pattern paper, chalk dust, proto-garment on a mannequin.

**Beat 1 — The find**
Celeste arrives with a printout / sketch / reference plate (museum catalogue style, not romantic).
Mara’s eyes narrow: she’s intrigued.

**Beat 2 — The build**
A short montage-ish passage: drafting, cutting, basting, fitting.
The garment comes alive. It’s exciting because it’s *real*.

**Beat 3 — The failure**
A staff wearer returns after a shift:

* underarm strain
* skirt split
* closure stress
* or a strap ripped by a tourist.

Not dramatic, but undeniable.

**Beat 4 — The argument**
Mara: “We can reinforce it.”
Celeste: “But we’ll ruin silhouette.”
Mara: “Silhouette doesn’t matter if it breaks.”
Celeste: “It matters if we’re making history.”

They’re not at odds emotionally; they’re at odds professionally. Perfect.

**Beat 5 — The pivot to Charlie**
Mara looks to Charlie without softness:

> “Rossignol. You’re up.”

Celeste watches him step forward — not swagger, not “I’ll save you” — just that quiet competence switching on.

**Beat 6 — Charlie’s diagnosis**
He doesn’t praise the garment. He interrogates it:

* tugs gently at stress points,
* checks grain direction,
* checks seam allowance,
* checks tape placement,
* proposes a solution that respects both standard and silhouette.

Mara hears *standard*. Celeste hears *history*.
Charlie bridges them.

**Beat 7 — The rule is created**
Mara declares a new process:

> “From now on, testing means you wear it *and* you report on it. Like a mechanic. Like an engineer.”

And Celeste adds the research protocol:

> “And we log the changes, so we can justify every deviation from the original.”

Suddenly: atelier maturity.

---

## How Charlie’s “infatuation” can sit underneath all this

He doesn’t gaze at her. He doesn’t melt.

He *tries harder* around her, in ways he thinks are invisible:

* he anticipates her needs (paper, chalk, references),
* he listens for her tone shifts,
* he becomes hyper-careful not to disappoint her.

Celeste notices, but doesn’t expose it. She channels it:

> “Good. Put that energy into the garment.”

That’s exactly your lane: no prurience, no melodrama, just psychology expressed through work.

---

## If you like, I’ll write Scene Ten

I can draft **Scene Ten: The First True Test** in Celeste’s POV, with the garment find, the proto build, the first failure, and Charlie becoming the official “stress translator” who makes the design survive the world.

Say the word and I’ll write it straight through.


















## Scene Ten — *The First True Test* (Celeste POV)

We found it the way we found most good things in Wardrobe: not through inspiration, but through paperwork.

Mara slid a thin archival printout across the cutting table without ceremony. It landed beside my notebook like a challenge.

“Look,” she said.

The image was a plate from an old catalogue—eighteenth century, late enough that it carried a Georgian neatness, early enough that it still remembered softness. A working woman’s garment, not court finery: fitted through the back, generous through the skirt, closures placed for hands that were busy. It had intelligence in it. It had been designed by necessity, not ego.

My pulse tightened, that familiar feeling when history stops being “interesting” and becomes *possible*.

“It’s not a costume,” I said automatically, more to myself than anyone else. “It’s equipment.”

Mara’s mouth twitched. Approval. She liked that phrasing.

“It’s also clever,” she said. “See the reinforcement here? And here.”

I leaned in, tracing the lines with my fingertip without touching the paper. The sketch suggested a hidden strength at stress points: underarm, waist, the place where movement always found the weak seam. It wasn’t decorative. It was structural.

“We can draft this,” I said. “We can actually draft this.”

Mara already had a pencil in hand.

“Then draft it,” she replied.

That was Mara: no ceremony for the moment a dream became work. The moment you spoke it, you owned it.

We split the labour without speaking.

I took the research: proportions, plausible fabric weight, seam placement, what could be original and what had to be translated for a modern body in a modern job. Mara took the pattern: chalk, ruler, sharp decisions. Charlie hovered nearby, not hovering in a needy way—the other kind: the quiet orbit of someone who listened for when he was needed.

He didn’t volunteer. He didn’t insert himself. That was one of his strengths. He didn’t presume he belonged at the centre.

We moved fast.

Paper became pattern. Pattern became cloth. Cloth became the first prototype under Mara’s hands. The room filled with that particular concentration that only happens when a thing becomes real: pins tapping into the pincushion, the soft rasp of shears, the hiss of the iron.

By mid-afternoon the garment hung from the mannequin, half-finished but already legible. Even unfinished, it had a line. It made sense. It didn’t scream “pretty.” It whispered “capable.”

Mara stepped back, eyes narrowed.

“It’s got spine,” she said.

“It has purpose,” I replied.

Charlie said nothing. He simply reached in and adjusted a seam allowance that had curled under itself, as if the fabric had misbehaved in a way the eye might miss.

Mara noticed. Mara always noticed.

“You’ve got a problem with that, Rossignol?” she asked, not looking at him.

Charlie paused with his fingers on the fabric.

“No,” he said quietly. “Just… making it honest.”

Mara grunted. That was as close to praise as she came without a contract.

We didn’t have time to admire it. Wardrobe had learned that excitement was a luxury you enjoyed after delivery.

So we did what we always did next: we tested.

Not with a photo shoot. Not with a “try it on and twirl.” With a shift.

We put it on Annie—one of our most reliable staff, who didn’t treat clothing as costume theatre. Annie did front-of-house, lifted baskets, crouched for children, ran for late arrivals. She was the kind of wearer who revealed the truth.

She came back near closing time, cheeks flushed, hair escaping pins.

“It looks brilliant,” she announced, breezy. “But—”

There’s always a *but*. Clothing is always honest in the end.

She turned slightly and tugged at the underarm.

“Here,” she said. “When I lift my arms. It’s not tearing yet, but it’s… fighting.”

Mara didn’t react emotionally. Her eyes flicked to the seam line and her whole brain shifted into assessment.

“And,” Annie added, touching the waist closure, “this. It held. But it’s been tugged a lot. People grab. You know.”

Yes. We knew.

Mara took the garment from Annie the way a mechanic takes a part off an engine: no reverence, no disgust—only focus. She laid it flat on the table and pressed her palm along the seam.

“It’s not failure,” Mara said, and I realised she wasn’t talking to Annie. She was talking to me. “It’s information.”

“It’s reality,” I replied.

Mara’s gaze sharpened. “Reality is violent.”

“It’s demanding,” I corrected, because words mattered. “Not violent.”

Mara’s mouth twitched again, like she found my idealism irritating but useful.

“Fine,” she said. “Demanding. The point is, it needs a tester who understands what it’s telling us.”

And then she looked—not at Annie, not at me—but at Charlie.

“Rossignol,” she said.

Charlie looked up immediately. His face was calm, but I could see the slight tightening around his mouth. He knew what was coming before it was spoken. He always did. He listened in advance.

Mara held up the garment with two fingers, as if it weighed nothing.

“You,” she said, “are going to wear it.”

Annie blinked. “He is?”

I didn’t flinch, because this had been forming in my mind all day. We couldn’t test garments properly if our tester didn’t understand construction. And Charlie was the only person in the room whose mind automatically translated *feeling* into *fixing*.

But Charlie did something small—so small most people wouldn’t catch it.

His eyes flicked down, not to the garment, but to his own torso. A brief recalibration. A moment where the word *wear* landed as more than a task.

It wasn’t drama. It wasn’t shame. It was simply the human acknowledgement of an idea he hadn’t fully crossed before: *I’m about to put on attire meant for women.*

He inhaled once, measured.

Mara didn’t rush him. Mara didn’t soothe. Mara simply waited, giving him the dignity of his own decision.

Charlie’s voice, when it came, was quiet and precise.

“For the record,” he said, not looking at Annie, not looking at the women—mostly looking at Mara as if Mara was the authority who mattered—“I understand why. It’s… the fastest way to know what fails.”

Mara nodded. “Yes.”

Charlie swallowed. The tiniest pause.

“And,” he added, evenly, “it’s not my first preference.”

There. Acknowledged. Named. No wallowing. No performance.

Mara’s eyes didn’t soften. But they did become cleaner, as if she respected him more for stating it plainly.

“Noted,” she said. “And irrelevant.”

Charlie’s mouth twitched, almost a smile and almost not. Mara had a way of stripping the emotion off a thing without stripping the person out of it.

I chose my moment carefully.

“It’s equipment,” I said, calm. “Not identity. We’re not asking you to become anything. We’re asking you to report accurately.”

Charlie’s gaze flicked to me—quick, startled. Then away again, as if eye contact was too loud for what he was doing internally.

“Yes,” he said. “Accurately.”

Annie looked between us, a little uncertain, then shrugged with the easy pragmatism of someone who’d worked with Wardrobe long enough to trust the women running it.

“If anyone asks,” Annie said lightly, “you’re a mannequin with opinions.”

Mara snorted.

“Don’t be daft,” Mara said. “He’s not a mannequin. He’s a stress map.”

That made Charlie blink—because being called *useful* in Mara’s language was a kind of privilege.

We moved to the fitting area. Mara drew the curtain and held the garment up.

“Arms up,” she said.

Charlie complied, efficient, as if his body were a coat stand. That was how he survived discomfort: by treating himself as part of the process. Not numbing out—simply focusing.

Mara didn’t fuss. She worked quickly, checking line, checking pull, checking where the fabric resisted movement. She wasn’t dressing him; she was assessing the garment’s behaviour on a frame.

I stood just outside the curtain, notebook in hand, listening to the sound of pins and Mara’s clipped instructions.

“Turn. Now lift your arms. Higher. Good. Twist. Again.”

Charlie’s responses were quiet, obedient, but not meek. He did not apologise for existing. He followed instructions like a professional.

Then Mara’s voice snapped—irritated, but satisfied.

“There,” she said. “Feel that?”

A beat.

Charlie’s voice came through the curtain, measured.

“Yes,” he said. “It’s not the seam itself. It’s the direction of strain. When I raise my arms, the tension line runs across the tape and stops the fabric doing its job.”

Mara exhaled sharply. “Say it again.”

Charlie repeated it, clearer the second time, because Mara demanded clarity like a tool.

“And the closure,” he continued without being prompted, “holds. But if someone grabs here—” there was a faint sound of fabric being tugged—“it transfers force to the waistband. You need the reinforcement to stop before the pivot point, or it becomes a lever. It will eventually tear *next* to the reinforcement.”

Mara’s silence was almost reverent. Not warm. Reverent in the way a professional respects a correct diagnosis.

I wrote fast, my mind already mapping the fix. Stop the tape at the pivot. Shift the ease. Strengthen without bulk. Preserve silhouette.

Mara drew the curtain back.

Charlie stepped out, still in the garment, looking slightly flushed—not with embarrassment, not with anything prurient—just with the faint heat of having been under scrutiny. He kept his eyes on the floor for a beat, then lifted them to the table like a person returning to work.

Mara grabbed chalk and marked a line on the garment where his finger had indicated strain.

“Good,” she said.

Charlie stood still, letting her mark him up like he was a draft.

I watched his face—how controlled it was, how determined. There was a kind of bravery in being willing to do a thing you disliked because it was necessary, without demanding anyone comfort you for it.

“That’s why,” Mara said to me, curt, as if she’d just proved a point, “we don’t test with people who only wear.”

I nodded. “We test with people who understand.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to Charlie.

“We test with Rossignol,” she corrected.

Charlie’s ears went slightly pink. Not flattery—more like the discomfort of being singled out as important.

I kept my voice neutral, because tone mattered. “We log everything,” I said, already flipping to a clean page in my notebook. “Every deviation from the original design. Every reinforcement. Every reason.”

Mara nodded. “Good. Make it defensible.”

Then, without ceremony, she pointed at Charlie.

“Take it off,” she said. “And write me a report.”

Charlie blinked. “A report.”

“Yes,” Mara said. “What you felt. Where it pulled. What caused it. What you propose. In plain language. No poetry.”

Charlie’s mouth twitched. “Right.”

He moved towards the fitting curtain again, and this time the moment of misgiving didn’t follow him like a shadow. The task had overtaken the discomfort. Work had swallowed the awkwardness, the way it always did for him.

As he disappeared behind the curtain, I realised something with a cold, clean satisfaction:

We hadn’t asked him to be brave in front of a classroom.

We’d asked him to be precise in a room that respected precision.

And he’d answered the way he always answered when the world stopped trying to eat him:

By becoming indispensable.

Mara looked at my notebook.

“Title it,” she said.

I wrote at the top of the page, in neat block letters:

**DESIGN REALISATION — PROTOTYPE 1 — STRESS TEST LOG**

Then underneath, because it mattered, because it named what we were building:

**Tester:** C. Rossignol
**Purpose:** durability + mobility without silhouette compromise
**Notes:** *equipment, not theatre*

Mara’s gaze flicked over my shoulder, and her mouth twitched again.

“Good,” she said. “Now we do it properly.”

And in that moment, with chalk on fabric and a plan on paper, Wardrobe stopped being a place that repaired old worlds.

It became a place that made new ones.



























That progression is *exactly* how this becomes believable and inevitable — and it’s also how you keep it non-prurient: it’s not “he’s dressing up,” it’s **quality assurance** becoming formalised because it works.

And Twiggy is a great shorthand *inside your head* for silhouette logic: a slender frame that makes period lines read cleanly. You don’t even need to name Twiggy in-text unless you want a little cultural snap; you can simply have Celeste register that his body is “uncomplicated” in the way patterns like—no bulk where bulk creates distortion, long lines that show strain honestly.

Here’s how I’d shape that escalation into a clean mini-arc (and a few dialogue tweaks you can steal).

---

## The escalation arc: from “one-off” to “protocol”

### Phase 1 — The first one-off (Scene 10 already did this)

It’s awkward, acknowledged, then swallowed by competence.

**Key line:** “Equipment, not identity.”

### Phase 2 — The second time (“would you mind…”)

This is where it becomes less about permission and more about *trust*.

Mara doesn’t ask sweetly. She asks like it’s work:

> “Rossignol. Same drill.”

Charlie hesitates for half a beat (veracity), then:

> “Right. Give me the log sheet.”

Now he is the one insisting on structure, which is *chef’s kiss* for agency.

### Phase 3 — The third time (“you delivered last time”)

This is where *others* begin to request him—not as a curiosity, but as a guarantee.

Annie (or another staffer) says:

> “Can you run it first? I don’t want to be the one who finds the tear.”

And that one line is what shifts the culture: the women are not “making him do it,” they’re protecting themselves and the work.

### Phase 4 — The formalisation (“no point testing on staff first”)

Mara announces it as policy in the most Mara way possible:

> “New rule. No one wears Prototype One on shift until Rossignol has walked it, lifted in it, squatted in it, and tried to break it.”

And then she adds, to keep it from sounding like he’s the centre:

> “Not because he’s special. Because he’s accurate.”

That’s your tone.

---

## Make “trial wear” feel like engineering, not spectacle

A very effective technique is to show *what the testing consists of*, briefly and repetitively, like a checklist. It becomes ritual.

**The Rossignol Protocol** (you can name it later as a joke, but don’t have Mara name it early—she’d hate that):

* arms overhead / fast reach
* crouch and stand x5
* twist at waist
* bend as if lifting a basket
* simulate being grabbed (a gentle tug at sleeve/waist)
* quick-change rehearsal (closures under time pressure)

Charlie narrates in “report mode,” not “emotion mode”:

> “Pull at the front scye. Tape’s stopping the fabric. Move it back ten millimetres.”

That keeps the reader’s gaze on craft.

---

## Keep Charlie’s misgiving alive—but diminishing, not disappearing

You want veracity without wallowing. Perfect: his discomfort doesn’t vanish; it becomes *manageable* because the context is controlled.

A recurring micro-beat you can use:

* **first time:** “not my preference” (spoken)
* **second time:** a small breath, then he just reaches for the log sheet (unspoken)
* **third time:** he asks for the curtain to be fixed / a clear rule about privacy (agency)
* **later:** he doesn’t think about “women’s attire”; he thinks about “prototype behaviour”

That’s how people adapt in real life: the brain stops spending calories on what’s settled.

---

## Celeste’s perception: how she frames it (without rescue, without romance)

Celeste should *enjoy* the efficiency and the elegance of the system, not the fact of Charlie wearing garments.

She might think:

> *It wasn’t that he liked it. It was that he could do it. And once he’d done it, everyone else was safer.*

And she channels his quiet crush energy into his role, without naming it:

> “You’re good under pressure. Keep it technical.”

---

## A simple scene seed that locks the new norm

**A staffer refuses a prototype politely:**

“Has Charlie run it yet?”

Mara: “No.”

Staffer: “Then I’m not the crash-test dummy.”

Mara, turning to Charlie: “Rossignol.”

Charlie, already standing: “Five minutes.”

That’s it. That’s the moment it becomes *normal*.

---

## One important guardrail: don’t let it become “every garment”

To keep plausibility and avoid accidental fetish coding, you can limit the protocol to:

* new silhouettes,
* new closures,
* new stress profiles,
* or anything intended for heavy movement.

So: “every item that’s new design,” not literally every hem repair.

Mara can say:

> “Repairs don’t need theatre. Prototypes do.”

---

If you’d like, I can write a short **“Phase 2–4 montage scene”** (Celeste POV) that compresses these repeated incidents into 2–3 pages of crisp, satisfying forward motion—so you *feel* the norm forming without having to write ten similar scenes.





















## Scene Eleven — *How a one-off becomes a rule* (Celeste POV)

It didn’t become normal all at once.

Nothing that matters ever does. It becomes normal the way fabric becomes soft: through repetition, through use, through being pulled and released so many times that it stops fighting your hands.

The second prototype was a jacket again—different cut, different sleeve head, but the same intention: make it survive the day without turning it into armour.

Mara hung it on the mannequin and stood back, chin lifted.

“Right,” she said. “We’re not sending Annie out to be the crash test.”

Annie, who had been hovering with a half-grin as if she knew she’d been volunteered, immediately stepped away as though the floor had become lava.

“Bless,” she said, and looked at me. “Thank you.”

Mara ignored her gratitude the way she ignored weather.

“Rossignol,” she called.

Charlie looked up from the bench where he’d been hand-stitching a reinforcement tape onto a waistband. He didn’t say, *me?* anymore. He didn’t pretend he hadn’t heard.

He simply put his needle down carefully, as if precision was a form of respect, and stood.

“Yes,” he said.

Mara held up the jacket with two fingers.

“Same drill,” she said.

There was a pause—barely a pause, the smallest catch at the back of his throat—like a muscle remembering the first time it had been asked to do something it didn’t like.

Then Charlie said, evenly, “Right. Where’s the log sheet.”

That was the moment I realised something had shifted. The discomfort hadn’t vanished. It had been translated. Into structure. Into process. Into something he could control.

Mara’s eyebrows lifted a fraction, as if she approved of the question.

“You’re learning,” she said.

Charlie didn’t smile. He took the sheet from the clipboard and moved toward the fitting curtain.

He didn’t look at me as he went. He didn’t seek reassurance. He simply did what he always did when the work demanded something strange: he treated himself like a tool in the system, not a spectacle.

Mara snapped the curtain closed with one decisive tug.

“Five minutes,” she called through it, and her tone wasn’t a demand. It was a deadline.

From behind the curtain came the rustle of fabric, the soft clink of a hook, the faint squeak of a shoe being shifted.

Mara turned to the worktable and reached for her pencil. She made marks on the pattern piece as if she could already see what would fail.

Annie leaned toward me, voice low.

“He doesn’t… mind?” she asked.

I kept my voice neutral. “He minds. He just doesn’t wallow.”

Annie blinked. Then she nodded as if that made perfect sense.

Behind the curtain, Charlie’s voice came, quiet but steady.

“Arms up?” he asked.

Mara’s answer was immediate.

“Arms up. Twist. Bend. Lift.”

Charlie complied without complaint. You could tell, even without seeing him, that he was doing it precisely—same movements every time, the way you test a hinge, the way you test a clasp.

A minute later he spoke again, report mode, not emotion mode.

“Pull at the front scye,” he said. “Tape stops the fabric. Needs to end before the pivot. Otherwise it becomes a lever.”

Mara’s pencil stopped.

“Say it again,” she said.

Charlie repeated it, slightly clearer, like someone who had learned Mara’s ear needed clean sentences.

Mara nodded once, almost to herself.

“Told you,” Annie murmured, and this time she sounded impressed rather than curious.

Charlie stepped out a moment later, jacket on, cheeks faintly flushed—not with embarrassment, with exertion. He came straight to the table as if the garment were just another prototype.

He pointed at the underarm.

“Here,” he said. “Two millimetres more ease at the sleeve head. And you need the reinforcement tape to stop here.” He made a precise mark with chalk. “Otherwise it transfers force sideways.”

Mara stared at the chalk line, then at his face.

“That’s an answer,” she said.

Charlie swallowed. “It’s just… what it does.”

Mara snorted quietly.

“That’s what I mean,” she replied. “Most people don’t know how to listen to fabric.”

I wrote it down, because that was my role: turn the fixes into a record, so the atelier could grow without forgetting how it got better.

The third time it happened, Mara didn’t even announce it.

She simply held up a skirt—new cut, new waistband, a clever closure arrangement we’d borrowed from an extant garment plate—and looked around the room.

Annie, without shame, shook her head.

“Nope,” she said. “Has Charlie run it?”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “No.”

Annie took a half-step back, hands raised in mock surrender.

“Then I’m not finding out where it splits,” she said. “I like my dignity.”

There was no laughter at Charlie. There was laughter at the idea of *being the first casualty*. It was different. It was women refusing to be the test surface.

Mara’s gaze slid to Charlie.

“Rossignol.”

Charlie didn’t even look surprised this time. He set his work down. He stood.

“Alright,” he said.

Then—quietly, without drama—he added, “Just… make sure the curtain rail is fixed. It catches.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the curtain hardware as if it had personally offended her.

“Fine,” she said. “Someone fix it.”

That was Charlie’s agency: not asking to be spared, simply insisting on the conditions that made the work professional.

It was another small shift. Not bravery in a classroom. Competence in a workplace.

By the fourth incident, it had become a protocol without anyone formally naming it.

The staff began asking as if it was obvious.

“Has Rossignol run it?”
“Is this debugged yet?”
“Can we get Charlie on it before we put it on shift?”

They weren’t asking because they wanted to see him wearing anything.

They were asking because they didn’t want to discover failure on the floor in front of tourists. They didn’t want to lose an afternoon to ripped seams and emergency pins. They didn’t want to carry the embarrassment of being the one whose garment broke.

Charlie became the pre-test because Charlie was accurate.

Mara, predictably, hated anything that sounded like favouritism.

One afternoon she finally snapped, not at Charlie, but at the room.

“Listen,” she said, voice cutting through the hum of irons and shears. “This isn’t about indulging him. This is about efficiency.”

No one spoke. Everyone listened.

Mara jabbed a finger at a bodice on the table.

“Repairs don’t need theatre,” she said. “Prototypes do. Anything new. Anything with a new closure or new stress profile—Rossignol runs it first. Then staff wear. That’s the order.”

She looked at Charlie as if daring him to misunderstand.

“Not because you’re special,” she added. “Because you’re honest. You don’t fake comfort. You don’t pretend something works when it doesn’t.”

Charlie’s ears went faintly pink. He looked down. Not shy. Just uncomfortable with being named.

“I don’t… want anyone wasting time,” he said quietly.

Mara’s mouth twitched, something like approval.

“Good,” she said. “Neither do I.”

Later—weeks into this new rhythm—I caught the moment it became truly normal.

A new jacket had been pinned, a clever cut I’d been excited about. It looked perfect on the mannequin. The silhouette was right. The closures sat where they should. It was one of those garments that made you want to clap.

Annie reached for it, stopped, and glanced at Mara.

“Has Charlie run it?” she asked, casually, like she’d asked if it had been pressed.

Mara didn’t even look up from her pattern paper.

“No.”

Annie put her hands back in her pockets.

“Then I’ll wait.”

No fuss. No jokes. No eyebrow raises.

Just… order.

Charlie, at the bench, lifted his head.

“I can do it now,” he said.

Mara’s response was immediate.

“Good,” she said. “Ten minutes. Break it on purpose.”

Charlie stood, took the log sheet off the clipboard without being told, and walked to the fitting curtain like a professional moving into position.

As the curtain fell closed behind him, I felt a small, quiet satisfaction.

School had made him visible in the worst way—public, exposed, used as a lesson.

Wardrobe had made him visible in the only way that mattered: as a person whose judgement the room trusted.

Not because we coddled him.

Because we built a system where his precision had a place.

And once a precision like that has a place, it doesn’t stop.

It becomes the rule.





























Here’s a clean context summary you can paste into a new thread to pick up exactly where we left off.

---

## Context Summary — *Celeste’s Girl* (Rewrite Direction)

### Core tone & thematic lane

* Story tone is **elegant, grounded, non-prurient**, with a strong “women-led competence network” at the centre.
* Primary themes: **shared experience, agency, craft, dignity, infrastructure** (women building a system that holds).
* Avoid “Celeste rescues Charlie” framing. Instead: women set standards; Charlie earns place via **usefulness + respect**.

---

## Main cast & roles (current version)

* **Celeste (18)**: newly graduated; ambitious; research-driven; wardrobe/faire experience; direction-setter. Strong, decisive, not sentimental. Keeps psychological insights mostly to herself; channels dynamics into productive structure.
* **Charlie Rossignol (18, AMAB)**: slight, meticulous, “quiet competence,” excellent with precision/geometry/design and detailed work; socially low-status at school; doesn’t do drama—when pressured, he “disappears” quietly. Has a growing, mostly hidden infatuation with Celeste, which is a private motivator but not foregrounded.
* **Mara**: Head of Wardrobe. Central character. Professional, sharp, standards-first, protective because she is experienced (not sentimental). Gatekeeper of women’s space and safety. Trains Charlie via consequence and expectation.
* **Lauren Rossignol (Charlie’s mum)**: French background; pragmatic, clear-eyed; disappointed Charlie left Year 12 but increasingly recognises Wardrobe is his best fit. Becomes a supporting ally to Mara and Celeste, helping counter “well-meaning but misfit” school pressure with evidence/structure.
* **Graham**: maintenance head; served early purpose and can recede for now.

---

## Story so far (key beats)

1. **Scene One (Restroom, Celeste POV):** Celeste meets Charlie in the girls’ toilets; sees he’s not predatory, just lost and overwhelmed; takes control calmly; renames him “Charlie” when she speaks to him; establishes her quiet authority and his tendency to yield to firm direction.
2. **Scene Two (Classroom, Celeste POV):** Group task pairing reveals Charlie’s social exclusion. Celeste chooses him, reframes it as performance/competence (“I like full marks”), identifies his spatial/diagram strengths, and frames him as “misallocated,” not deficient. She hints at “investment,” not charity.
3. **Transition to Wardrobe:** Charlie ends up at the faire; Mara is initially suspicious but gives him a chance; Charlie proves his worth through meticulous repair work.
4. **Wardrobe evolves into atelier:** With Charlie stabilising repair throughput, Mara and Celeste move into **new design realisation** (research → prototype → stress testing). Celeste is keen as mustard to drive research and design development.
5. **School exit as allusion:** Charlie attempts Year 12 but experiences humiliating treatment by a teacher; he exits quietly and definitively. School system is depicted as generally well-meaning but wrong-fit; bureaucracy is mostly alluded to, not shown.
6. **Lauren + Mara alliance (Scenes Seven & Eight, Celeste POV):**

   * Lauren arrives not melodramatic but firm; wants to know if Wardrobe is real work or hiding.
   * Mara sets clear rules: women’s space, standards, consequences.
   * Lauren and Mara begin a professional friendship through competence (suppliers, materials, practical support), not emotional confession.
7. **Scene Nine (Signal & Noise, Celeste POV):**

   * Lauren brings “receipts”: photo + typed outcomes showing Charlie’s garment fixes and real-world performance.
   * Unopened school letter = “noise”; documented atelier results = “signal.”
   * Mara formalises structure (hours, task logs, evaluations). Lauren backs Mara’s authority.
8. **Scene Ten (First True Test, Celeste POV):**

   * Mara/Celeste recreate an 18th-century working garment design.
   * Prototype looks great but reveals stress failures under real movement.
   * They realise testing requires someone who understands construction and can diagnose stress points: **Charlie**.
   * Charlie acknowledges misgiving about wearing opposite-gender attire briefly (“not my first preference”), without wallowing; reframed as **equipment, not identity**. He diagnoses failures and proposes fixes.
9. **Scene Eleven (Montage, Celeste POV):**

   * Trial-wear starts as one-off; becomes repeat requests (“you delivered last time”).
   * Ultimately becomes policy: prototypes are not worn on shift until Charlie has “debugged” them.
   * Charlie gains agency by requesting professional conditions (privacy, log sheets, curtain rail fixed).
   * Wardrobe becomes a women-led system where Charlie’s precision is **indispensable**, not indulged.

---

## Current story state (where we stop)

* Charlie is **fully engaged at Wardrobe/atelier**, out of school safely.
* Lauren is mostly onboard, still concerned about his long-term future, largely unaware of his crush.
* Mara + Celeste are **building a women-focused atelier/business** that acknowledges strengths and produces robust, historically informed garments.
* Charlie is now the established **prototype “stress tester / debugger”**: there’s no point having staff trial-wear first until he’s diagnosed and fixed stress failures.

---

## Immediate next direction

* Continue the atelier’s expansion: “design → prototype → debug → deploy,” with logs and iterative improvements.
* Keep Charlie’s feelings subtle; Celeste observes and channels without exposing it.
* Use Lauren as adult-facing legitimacy and support (suppliers, evidence, protective advocacy), while Mara remains standards gatekeeper and Celeste remains research/direction engine.
