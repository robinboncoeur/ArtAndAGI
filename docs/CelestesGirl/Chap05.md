## Celeste — Trust Test Two (Discretion)

Mara didn’t test people the way teachers tested them.

Teachers announced the test, circled the date, watched you sweat, and then pretended your result said something noble about your soul. Mara tested you the way you tested a seam: under her fingers, quietly, looking for strain. Charlie had been back for a second morning. Same early arrival. Same clean hands. Same careful stillness, as if he didn’t want the room to notice he’d come in.

Mara noticed everything. She didn’t say hello. She pointed at a tin on the table.

“Pins,” she said. “Sort them. Then you’re on mending pile.”

Charlie nodded once and moved, no dramatics. He poured the pins out onto a cloth and began arranging them by length with a kind of tidy focus that made the task look dignified. I was at the rail, tagging garment bags, listening to the hiss of the steamer and the small scrape of hangers sliding. Wardrobe had its own rhythm — calm on the surface, precise underneath — and Charlie had already started matching it without being told.

That was his first tell: he could join a system without trying to dominate it.

Mara’s second tell came ten minutes later, when she “accidentally” left a pair of vintage shears too close to the edge of the table. Not a dramatic setup. Just a temptation: a valuable tool sitting in the wrong place. A careless person would grab it without asking. A nervous person would ignore it and let it fall. Charlie noticed. His eyes flicked to it, then to Mara. He didn’t touch the shears. He nudged the cloth closer, stabilised the table edge with his palm, and slid the shears back with two fingers—careful, respectful—like he was returning a bird to its perch.

Mara didn’t look up. But I saw the smallest change in her mouth: the line eased by a millimetre. Ten minutes after that, she called across the room, voice neutral.

“Rossignol. Bring me the blue tape.”

Charlie paused, his gaze shifting to the shelves. There were three blue tapes, different widths. He didn’t guess. He looked once at Mara, then asked — quietly:

“Which width?”

Mara’s eyes lifted. She held his gaze for a beat. “Quarter-inch.”

Charlie retrieved the roll and brought it to her.

“Good.”

Just that. One syllable. It landed like a stamp. Charlie went faintly pink at the ears anyway, as if the word had surprised him. I kept my eyes on the tags, but my attention drifted. It wasn’t romantic interest. It was... data. I watched people the way you watched fabric: how it fell, where it pulled, what it revealed when it thought nobody was looking.

Charlie’s attention to Mara was respect. Charlie’s attention to the room was caution. Charlie’s attention to me—

That was different.

It wasn’t the obvious stare you got from boys who thought you existed to be noticed. It wasn’t even the furtive kind. It was as if his eyes kept finding me on their own, the way a compass needle finds north, and each time he realised, he corrected himself like it was a breach of discipline. He was trying not to.

Which made it almost endearing. Almost.

Mara sent him to the mending pile: a basket of small catastrophes — popped seams, torn cuffs, fraying apron ties. She didn’t give him the easiest ones. She gave him the ones where haste would show. Charlie sat, assessed each item the way he’d assessed the torn dress yesterday: calm, quiet. He chose thread that matched without holding it up to the light like a show. He measured seam allowance with his eye, then confirmed with a tape. He stitched with even tension, no puckering, no desperate pulling.

The room stayed stable around him. Half an hour later, Mara did another test. She handed Charlie a garment bag. 

“Hang that.”

It was heavier than it looked — wool, boning, metal closures. Charlie took it with both hands. He carried it the way you carried something that mattered, and when he reached the rail he stopped: didn’t hang it immediately. He looked at the rail, checking spacing, weight distribution, the hook’s position—like he was thinking not of this one garment but of the system as a whole. Then he hung it in a place that made sense, not in the first empty gap.

Mara watched him. She didn’t praise him. She just didn’t correct him. That was Mara’s version of warmth.

When she moved away, I stepped closer to Charlie’s table, because it was time to introduce the next lesson, and because I’d been told — explicitly — not to hover, but not told not to function.

“You’re stitching like you’ve done this for years.”

Charlie’s hands paused for half a second, needle hovering. Then he kept going.

“My mum,” he said, voice low. “She... she showed me. If you make it neat, people pay.”

“That’s true,” I replied. “And if you make it neat *here*, Mara doesn’t kill you.”

His mouth twitched. A small smile he didn’t quite permit to exist. I watched his eyes flick up to my face, and then away again too fast. Like touching a hot surface.

“Thanks.”

“For what?”

He swallowed. “For... yesterday. For - for getting me in.”

I let a beat pass. I didn’t want gratitude. Gratitude can turn into dependence, and dependence can rot a person.

“*You* got you in,” I said. “You turned up. You worked. Mara cares about that.”

His shoulders loosened slightly, like that was a relief and an insult in one. He threaded another needle, hands steady. Then, without looking at me, he murmured,

“I’m not... I’m not trying to be weird.”

“Weird how?”

His ears went a deeper pink. He frowned at the fabric as if it had betrayed him.

“I just—” 

He stopped. The words clogged. It was there, in the stall between his sentences: the thing he didn’t want to say because saying it would make it an admission, turn it into a liability. I could have teased him. I could have pretended I didn’t understand. I could have made it soft. But soft is how boys slip out of accountability.

So I did what I always did: I decided what it meant.

“You mean you don’t want to make me uncomfortable,” I said, evenly.

His head snapped up. Hazel eyes, startled. Then he looked down again, quick as shame.

“Yes,” he whispered.

“That’s good. Keep it that way.”

He nodded once — sharp, immediate — like he’d been given a rule and was relieved. Then, because his brain was honest even when his mouth wanted to be cautious, he added,

“It’s just... you’re... you’re a lot.”

I blinked.

“A lot?”

He winced as if he’d just spilled ink. “Not... not bad. I mean, you’re... you make things - make sense.”

It was his little crush on me, peeking out in its most Charlie form: not desire as entitlement, but admiration as gravity. It made me want to smile. However, I didn’t. I let it sit between us, uninflated. He did not need romance, but structure.

“You’re allowed to admire,” I said. “Just don’t let it derail you.”

His eyes flicked to mine: confused, searching. I continued, calmly:

“You’ve been living in rooms where you can’t win. Wardrobe is a room where you can. If you have strong feelings... aim them at your work. That will keep you safe.”

He stared at me, stunned by the fact I’d named it without making it dirty.

Then he nodded. Slowly.

“Okay.”

I glanced at the garment in his hands. “Make that repair invisible. Mara hates visible.”

He almost smiled again. I turned to go back to the rail, and that’s when he said it — the other confession, the one that mattered.

“I’m not going back next year,” he said, too quickly. “To school.”

I stopped, hand on a garment bag.

“What do you mean?”

He looked at his stitches. Not me. 

“I’m gonna wag it. I can’t… do it again. They just— they don’t—” He shook his head once, small and furious. “It’s a waste.”

I walked back to him and placed my finger lightly on the fabric near his seam, not touching him, just anchoring the moment.

“No,” I said, voice flat.

He blinked. “No?”

“You’re not wagging,” I replied. Simple. Not a debate.

His jaw tightened. “Why do you care?” I held his gaze.

“Because Mara will train you,” I said. “Your mum will back you. I can point you at doors. But if you sabotage your own foundation, you’ll spend your whole life needing someone to catch you.”

His throat bobbed. He looked away.

“That’s not fair,” he muttered.

“I’m not here to be fair,” I said. “I’m here to be accurate.”

He stared at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. I softened a fraction: not into comfort, into clarity.

“If school is the wrong language,” I said, “we’ll find you translation. But you don’t get to disappear. That’s the old you talking.”

He swallowed. “I don’t know how to do it.”

“Then you learn,” I said, and let a small edge of humour in, because humour makes medicine swallowable. “You’re doing a whole new trade. You can learn Year Twelve.”

His mouth twitched. He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no. But he didn’t argue either.

That, for Charlie, was progress.

Across the room, Mara’s voice cut through the hiss of the steamer.

“Rossignol!”

Charlie’s head snapped up immediately. 

“Yes?”

Mara held up a sleeve with a tear near the cuff. “This one. If you stitch it tight, I’ll know. And you’ll unpick it in front of everyone.”

Charlie went very still. Then he spoke, clear and calm.

“Okay.”

He rose, took the sleeve, and walked to Mara’s table with the careful confidence of someone who had found a rule-set that didn’t hate him. As he passed me, his eyes flicked to my face again — quick, warm, grateful, frightened — and then away. Not taking anything. Just... orbiting.

I watched him go and thought, not unkindly:

*He’s going to have to learn that being chosen is not a miracle. It’s a responsibility.*

And I’m not letting him waste it.
