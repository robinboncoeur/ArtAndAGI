# A Real Education Begins

## French Lessons

Dinner over, the girls repaired to their rooms. In a matter of moments, Charlie was left alone with the taciturn Pauline who had busied herself clearing the dishes and generally cleaning up. Presently, she swept close to him, and settled herself on the bench.

"Il parait que vous parlez francais?" she asked gently. (*it appears you speak french?*)

Charlie nodded. "Un peu, oui, mais pas bien," he stammered shyly. (*a little, yes, but not well*)

The room is dimly lit, with the only light coming from a single, flickering candle resting on a small, roughly hewn wooden table. The candle’s flame sputters occasionally, casting long, wavering shadows across the room’s stone walls. The air is crisp and biting; a chill hangs in the room, the kind that seeps into your bones, making you reluctant to leave the meager warmth of the bed.

Charlie was lying awake beneath the covers, dreading the inevitable moment when he must leave the relative warmth of the bed. The coarse woolen blanket provides little comfort against the pervasive cold. His breath fogged in the chilly air as he shivered, feeling every hard lump and uneven surface of the straw-stuffed mattress beneath him.

Pauline was already awake and fully dressed, moving about the room with practiced ease. She adjusted the candlewick to brighten the small flame, its light illuminating the rough-hewn furniture and the simple belongings in the room. Her movements are quiet but efficient, a sharp contrast to Charlie’s hesitation.

"Time to rise, Sharl," she said kindly but firmly. "There’s much to do before the sun comes up."

Sharl winced at the thought of leaving the scant warmth of the bed but he knew there was no point in delaying. Slowly, he pulled back the covers, the cold air immediately pricking at his skin. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, his feet touching the icy wooden floor. The shock of the cold against his bare feet was sharp, making him gasp involuntarily.

Pauline handed him a simple, well-worn chemise, the fabric soft but thin, offering little protection against the morning chill. Sharl hesitated, still groggy, as he took the garment from her. The chemise was unlike anything he’d worn before — loose and flowing, its simplicity a far cry from the modern, fitted clothing he was used to.

"It’s so cold…"

Pauline nodded, her expression understanding but resolute.

"It always is in the early hours. You’ll get used to it."

Sharl pulled the chemise over his head, feeling the fabric brush against his skin. The hem fell just below his knees, the loose sleeves billowing slightly as he moved. The sensation was strange, unfamiliar—this isn’t the comforting, cozy warmth of his modern clothes, but rather a utilitarian garment designed for modesty and practicality.

Next, PAULINE hands Sharl a pair of thick woolen stockings. The fabric is rough against his skin, but he gratefully pulls them on, appreciating the slight barrier they provide against the cold. The stockings reach up to his knees, and he awkwardly ties them in place with simple garters, his fingers fumbling with the unfamiliar ties in the dim candlelight.

**PAULINE**
(speaking softly)
Now the stays.

Sharl’s eyes widen slightly at the sight of the stays—structured, stiffened with boning, and designed to shape the body into the desired silhouette. They look imposing, restrictive, a far cry from anything he’s worn before. But there’s no room for protest; this is part of the role he’s agreed to play, part of the “complete experience” that he’s come to realize is far more than just a game.

With PAULINE’s help, Sharl slips the stays over his chemise. The fabric of the chemise bunches slightly under the stiff structure, and he struggles to adjust it, feeling awkward and clumsy. PAULINE moves behind him, pulling the laces tight. The sensation is immediate—his posture is forcibly corrected, his back straightened, and his breathing slightly restricted.

**DORA**
(breathing slightly faster)
It’s… tight.

**PAULINE**
(gently)
It’s meant to be. You’ll learn to breathe with it. Now, the petticoats.

PAULINE hands Sharl the first of two petticoats, a thick woolen garment designed for warmth as much as for modesty. Sharl steps into it, feeling the weight of the fabric settle around his legs. The petticoat ties at the waist, adding another layer that both insulates and restricts his movement. The second petticoat, slightly lighter, adds even more volume.

As Sharl ties the petticoat’s waistband, he feels the layers of fabric gathering around his waist, the fullness of the skirts billowing out from his hips. The weight of the petticoats pulls slightly against his waist, a constant reminder of the garments’ presence, as if they are an extension of his body, demanding accommodation and adjustment with every move.

**PAULINE**
You’re nearly there. Just the gown and apron left.

The gown, made of coarse wool, is simple but practical. Sharl slips it on, feeling the fabric pull over the stays and petticoats. The bodice fits snugly over the stays, flattening his chest and emphasizing the narrow waist created by the structured undergarments. The skirt of the gown adds yet another layer of fabric, swishing around his ankles as he moves.

Finally, PAULINE hands Sharl the apron, a plain but essential part of his attire. He ties it around his waist, the fabric falling flat against the full skirts of the petticoats, covering the front of the gown. The apron is meant to protect the gown from dirt and wear during the day’s work.

With the last item—a simple linen cap—Sharl’s transformation is complete. The cap fits snugly over his hair, which Pauline has carefully arranged into a simple bun earlier. The sensation of the cap against his head is strange; it’s not uncomfortable, but it’s a constant presence, reminding him of the role he now inhabits.

**PAULINE**
(stepping back, appraising)
There. You’re ready.

Sharl stands there, feeling the weight of the clothes, the constriction of the stays, the unfamiliar bulk of the petticoats. Every movement feels awkward, restricted, as if his body is no longer entirely his own. The cold of the room is now dulled by the layers of clothing, but he can still feel it in his fingers and toes, in the breath that fogs in the air before him.

He looks at PAULINE, a mixture of emotions in his eyes—confusion, resignation, and a growing sense of determination. This is the life he has stepped into, a far cry from the modern world he knows. The clothes are not just garments; they are a barrier, a challenge, a new skin he must learn to live in.

**PAULINE**
You’ll get used to it, Sharl. Just remember—it’s not just about wearing the clothes. It’s about becoming the role, living it, breathing it. Every stitch, every layer is part of who you must be here.

Sharl nods slowly, still adjusting to the weight of the clothes and the new identity they impose on him. The day is just beginning, and with it, a new chapter in his life—a chapter written in the language of a time long past, where every garment, every task, every interaction is a test of his ability to adapt and endure.
