# Scene 34



## From 25.01.05

I didn’t sleep straight through.

Not because of drama. Not because of romance. Not because midnight moisturiser had turned the house into a perfume advert.

Because something had shifted, and my brain—annoyingly—insisted on auditing it.

I lay there in the dark and replayed the moment at the sink: his careful *yes*, the way his shoulders had dropped like he’d been carrying a weight he didn’t know he was allowed to set down. The clean quiet of it. The fact that nothing in me had flared into panic afterwards.

No alarm bells. No “what have I started.” No fear that I’d offered care and accidentally created a debt.

Just… an unfamiliar steadiness.

Which, for me, was suspicious.

I rolled onto my side and stared at the faint outline of the curtain. I told myself, very plainly, that tenderness wasn’t a trap. Not if it was done with consent and standards. Not if it was reversible. Not if it didn’t make a person smaller.

But I also knew myself well enough to admit the other truth: I liked leading.

I liked deciding.

I liked the feeling of a room becoming orderly because I’d willed it.

And Charli—sweet, maddening Charli—responded to leadership the way dry ground responds to rain. Not desperately. Just… gratefully. As if he’d been built for it and had spent his whole life pretending he wasn’t.

That was where the danger lived, if there was one.

Not in him.

In me.

I could turn his willingness into my favourite kind of power without even noticing I was doing it.

So I ran my checks, like I always did.

**Is he freer tomorrow?**
**Does he carry the standard without me prompting?**
**Would I still do this if Lauren walked in and watched?**

The last one made me swallow.

Lauren.

That nod she’d given me the day she came to Wardrobe. The look I’d clocked at the time and filed under *mother assessing girlfriend candidate*. I’d assumed judgement because it was easier than assuming responsibility.

Now I understood.

It wasn’t judgement. It had been… a handover.

*He’ll listen to you. Don’t be careless.*

I lay there a moment longer, then made a decision.

If I was going to soften, I was going to soften with rules.

Tenderness could be part of my standards.

It could be a tool I used on purpose.

And if I used it, I would keep it clean.

---

In the morning, I woke to a noise that didn’t belong to my routine.

Not loud. Not intrusive. Just… the soft clink of ceramic. The kettle. A cupboard door closed with care rather than a bang.

Infrastructure noise.

I didn’t move right away. I stayed in bed and listened, because listening told you the truth faster than seeing.

There was a pause—water poured. A spoon tapped once against a mug, then stopped.

Then the bathroom door opened and closed again. Footsteps. A drawer. The faint, unmistakable sound of someone using floss.

I blinked into the pillow, the corner of my mouth twitching.

Good.

I wasn’t going to congratulate him. Praise too early turned into performance. He didn’t need a gold star. He needed the satisfaction of doing the thing and seeing it become normal.

When I eventually came out, hair clipped up, hoodie on, my mind still half in study-mode, I found him at the kitchen counter.

He’d done something with his hair again—tied neatly back, no loose panic strands, no elastic halfway down. It sat like it belonged there.

There was tea for me. My mug. The one with the chipped rim I refused to throw out because it had survived more exams than most people survived relationships.

He didn’t announce it. He didn’t say, *Look, I did it.*

He just slid it toward me with the same calm competence he used when he put finished garments into labelled totes.

“Morning,” he said.

“Morning,” I replied, letting my eyes flick over him quickly—clean shirt, face not greyed-out, the faintest hint of moisturiser sheen rather than dry tightness at the cheeks.

He watched me like he was waiting for the world to accuse him of trying too hard.

I took the mug.

Didn’t praise. Didn’t tease. Just acknowledged.

“Good,” I said.

His shoulders loosened. Barely, but enough for me to notice.

He nodded once and went back to whatever he was doing—packing his bag, checking something on his phone, quietly preparing for the day.

And there it was again: the thing that always got me.

He made a home run better simply by existing in it.

Not by taking up space.

By making space hold.

I took a sip of tea and let the warmth steady me.

One check passed.

**He carried the standard forward.**

---

At Wardrobe, the room had its own gravity.

Mara was already in motion when we arrived, a clipboard under one arm, eyes scanning the workstations the way other people scanned social media. She didn’t look up to greet anyone because she didn’t believe in wasting attention on ceremony.

She noticed Charli immediately anyway.

Because Mara noticed everything.

She didn’t comment on his hair. Mara didn’t compliment appearance unless it was directly related to function. But she handed him a new wear-test sheet and said, briskly:

“Good. You’re presentable. Less contamination risk.”

That was Mara’s version of *well done*.

Charli nodded, accepting it as if it were a normal sentence in a normal world. Which, in here, it was.

I watched him move through the workroom with a steadier baseline than he’d had even a week ago. He wasn’t “trying to be attractive.” That was the wrong lens entirely.

He was trying to be… maintained.

And there was something in me that wanted to laugh, because it was so unfairly effective.

The girls shifted around him differently too.

Not in a romantic way. In a respect way.

People treated you with more seriousness when you looked like you took yourself seriously. It wasn’t kind. It was human.

Tilly drifted past once, eyes lingering the way hers did when she wanted to test a boundary without technically crossing it.

I didn’t even turn.

I just said, calmly, to the room at large, “Reminder: no comments on the tester’s body. Talk about the garment.”

Tilly’s face did a tiny rearrangement—she reset herself instantly, all innocence, all compliance.

“Of course,” she said brightly.

Good.

That was what I wanted. Not humiliation. Correction.

Charli didn’t look embarrassed. He didn’t shrink. He simply wrote something on his sheet and kept going.

That was another check.

**He stayed whole under my leadership.**

---

Around late morning, I caught him in the mirror by the fitting area.

He was adjusting the collar of his shirt—one small tug, a smooth-down. He did it absentmindedly, like it had become part of his routine, not an anxious performance.

Something in my chest tightened.

I wasn’t an aggressor. I didn’t want to pounce on him and make him responsible for my feelings. I didn’t want to turn him into a mirror I used to reassure myself I was wanted.

But I did want to keep him slightly off balance.

Not unsafe off balance.

Just… awake.

Because Charli had a habit of disappearing inside usefulness. If I let him, he would become the perfect support beam and no one would ever look up and see him.

Not even me.

So I used my tenderness the way I used my standards: deliberately.

I walked up behind him, close enough for him to sense me, and said quietly:

“May I?”

He turned his head, startled. His eyes flicked to mine.

“Yes,” he said. Always that careful yes. Always chosen.

I reached up and smoothed his collar—two quick motions, brisk and competent. Not lingering. Not caressing. Just… finishing the detail like I would on a garment.

Then I stepped back.

“Better,” I said.

His breath caught, very slightly, like his body had received something it hadn’t been expecting.

He nodded. “Okay.”

I watched him try to act normal for a second too long.

Then I turned away and went back to the cutting table as if nothing had happened.

That was the point.

Tenderness, offered and withdrawn cleanly, made him visible to himself.

He didn’t know what to do with it. Which meant he couldn’t file it away as “just business.”

It wasn’t business.

It was care.

I felt my own pulse steady.

And I ran the check again, because I refused to become the kind of person who used someone’s softness as a toy.

**Did that make him smaller?**

No.

He straightened a fraction. He looked… anchored. Like a person who’d been reminded, in two swift movements, that he was worth finishing properly.

Good.

---

That afternoon, we had a small crisis—one of the production stitchers called in sick, a courier delayed, a batch of hems came back with tension issues.

The room tightened the way it always did under pressure.

Mara didn’t raise her voice. She simply changed the system.

“Re-route,” she snapped. “We cut here, finish there, pack later. No heroics.”

The girls moved. The work shifted. The machine kept running.

Charli dropped into the gap like he’d been designed for it.

No complaint. No martyrdom. He just… solved.

I caught him at one point refilling the big water jug, wiping a spill without being asked, replacing a roll of tape, then slipping back into wear-testing without anyone even noticing he’d kept the room functional.

My chest ached with an odd, fierce pride.

This was the moment, I realised, where other girls would have leaned into romance as reward.

They’d have flirted. They’d have turned gratitude into a game.

I didn’t want that kind of power.

I wanted something cleaner.

So when the rush broke, when the courier finally arrived and the room exhaled, I walked up to him again—this time from the front—and asked:

“Can I do something?”

He blinked. “What?”

“I want to,” I said, and kept my voice level, “give you a small thank you. And I want your consent before I do.”

He stared at me like he couldn’t compute the sentence. People didn’t usually ask him permission to care for him.

“What is it?” he asked, cautious.

I could feel my own heart thumping, ridiculous and steady at once.

I chose the safest version.

“I want to kiss your forehead,” I said. “Once. Not a test. Not a trade. Just… a thank you. You can say no.”

His face went hot so fast it was almost comical.

He swallowed. Looked down. Looked up again.

Then he nodded, very small.

“Yes,” he said.

I stepped in, kissed his forehead once—brief, warm, finished—and stepped back immediately.

No lingering. No second kiss. No looking to see if he’d “react.”

I watched his eyes flutter shut for half a second, involuntary. Like his nervous system couldn’t help but register gentleness as relief.

Then he opened them again and tried to look like a normal person in a normal workplace.

He failed, slightly.

His mouth quivered into the smallest smile.

“Okay,” he whispered, as if he’d been given something rare and didn’t want to break it by speaking too loudly.

I nodded once, precise.

“Back to work,” I said.

And the words weren’t cold. They were stabilising.

He went back to his station.

He worked better.

Not frantic-better. Just… calmer. Cleaner.

I turned away and felt my own throat tighten.

Lauren’s test flashed in my mind:

**Would I do this if she watched?**

Yes.

Because nothing about it was secretive. Nothing about it demanded anything. Nothing about it put him in a position where he’d feel he had to pay me back.

It was care given like a standard.

It was a woman leading without exploiting.

I felt something inside me soften—permission, again.

---

That night, at home, he didn’t have to ask me about moisturiser.

He simply went into the bathroom after dinner and did it.

I heard him pat his face dry. I heard the pump bottle dispense. I heard the cap close.

He came out looking faintly uncertain, as if he expected me to comment.

I didn’t.

I simply looked up from my book and said, “You’re doing it.”

His eyes widened. “What?”

“Meeting the standard,” I said.

He swallowed, then nodded.

“Yeah,” he said quietly. “It’s… not hard. I just… didn’t.”

I watched him in the lamplight. The clean line of him. The maintained-ness. The quiet acceptance of being guided.

And I felt that pull again—stronger now, less filtered.

Not lust.

Something more dangerous and more beautiful: admiration.

Because he wasn’t resisting.

He wasn’t negotiating.

He was letting himself be led and discovering that leadership could feel like safety rather than humiliation.

I closed my book.

He tensed slightly, as if he expected me to ask something of him.

I didn’t.

I simply said, “Come here.”

He approached, cautious.

I held out my hand, palm up, like I had with the brush.

“Hand,” I said.

He hesitated, then placed his hand in mine.

His skin was less rough at the knuckles already. The dryness was easing. The world hadn’t ended. Masculinity hadn’t fallen off him in chunks. He was just… cared for.

I ran my thumb lightly over the back of his hand, evaluating.

“Better,” I said.

He gave a shy little huff of laughter. “It’s been, like, two days.”

“Yes,” I said. “And it’s already better.”

He looked down at our hands like he couldn’t quite believe this was real.

I felt the urge to overwhelm him—to pour out everything I’d been holding behind professionalism and restraint.

I didn’t.

I chose one clean sentence instead.

“I like when you let me lead,” I said.

His breath stopped.

He looked up slowly, eyes wide, not hungry, not triumphant—just stunned.

“I—” he started, and failed.

I tightened my hold very slightly, not to trap him, but to anchor him.

“You don’t have to say anything,” I said. “Just… hear it.”

He nodded once, swallowing hard.

“I hear it,” he whispered.

And in his face, in that soft, grateful steadiness, I saw the answer to my exploitation check more clearly than any theory could give me:

He wasn’t being diminished.

He was being *built.*

I let go of his hand and leaned back into the couch as if nothing monumental had happened.

Because I refused to make a spectacle of tenderness.

“Tea?” I asked, casual.

Charli blinked, still processing. Then he nodded, grateful for the normality.

“Yeah,” he said. “I can make it.”

Of course he could.

Infrastructure.

He went to the kitchen, and I watched him move—quiet, purposeful, steady.

And I realised, with a kind of startled certainty that made my chest feel too small:

I hadn’t stumbled on a gem.

I’d stumbled on the exact kind of person my life needed.

Not because he would “provide.”

Because he would *hold.*

And the more willingly he accepted my standards—my lead, my shape for his life—the more powerfully my attraction locked into place.

Not as hunger.

As alignment.

As home.

And this time, when I asked myself, *Am I exploiting?* the answer arrived in the most honest way possible:

One look at Charli’s face as he set my mug down—careful, attentive, quietly pleased to have made something right—and I knew.

He was happy.

He was choosing it.

And so was I.
