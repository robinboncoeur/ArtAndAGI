### Scene Twenty-Six — “Unthinking” (Celeste POV)

It happened the way real changes happen at Wardrobe.

Not with an announcement or a meeting. Not with anyone asking permission to rewrite the world. It happened in the middle of a Tuesday, over a seam that wouldn’t behave.

The workroom was in its daylight mood — bright enough to show flaws, kind enough to make fabric look matter-of-fact. The air held that familiar mixture of linen dust and steam and coffee that had gone slightly bitter in the pot because nobody had time to be precious about it.

Charlie was at the long table with the ledger open beside him, pencil tucked behind his ear in a gesture that still looked borrowed. He’d been chasing waste all morning, mapping it like a fault line: where we overcut, where we over-order, where we over-fix because we don’t stop and diagnose properly the first time.

He was in the zone. Which meant he was also vulnerable to interruption.

I’d learned that about him: once his mind locked onto a problem, it became tender—not weak, just exquisitely attentive, like a musician listening for a wrong note. If you startled him, the whole internal metronome stuttered.

I didn’t startle him. I never did, if I could help it.

“Green petticoat first,” I said, and slid the garment bag onto the table.

He looked up, then down at the bag, then at the ledger, as if mentally pairing the object with its entry.

“Re-test schedule,” he murmured, already halfway into it. “Seam stress shifting at—”

“Side-back,” I confirmed. “Under movement.”

He nodded and reached for the pencil.

That’s how he’d been since the definitions conversation: less boyish hope, more procedural clarity. When he got uncertain, he didn’t perform. He asked. When he felt the old story twitch—*let me pay, let me prove*—he swallowed it and returned to the work.

He was learning to belong through accuracy.

And accuracy, at Wardrobe, was a form of obedience.

A door clicked somewhere behind us—soft, careful, accompanied by the whisper of fabric and the faint scuff of sensible shoes.

Pauline entered with a folded bundle under one arm, her hair pinned back, her cap neat, her expression the same as always: serene until it wasn’t, and then terrifyingly direct.

She moved like she’d been trained in rooms that expected quiet competence.

I didn’t look up immediately. I didn’t need to. Pauline’s presence had its own gravity.

She placed the folded bundle on the end of the table, then walked closer, eyes taking in the green petticoat bag, the ledger, Charl’s posture, my handwriting in the margin. She read the room the way Mara did, only with less bluntness and the same certainty.

“Bonjour,” she said, because she always did—even when she knew we’d answer in English. It wasn’t a greeting so much as a reminder: *the standard exists.*

Charl said, “Hi,” too quickly. He caught himself and softened it. “Hello, Pauline.”

Pauline’s mouth twitched faintly. It might have been approval. It might have been amusement. With Pauline, you never got the luxury of certainty unless she wanted you to have it.

She leaned in to look at the ledger without asking. Of course she did.

“These… numbers,” she said, tapping one column with a fingertip. “It is… good. More… stable.”

Charl nodded, a little cautious, as if praise was a trap.

Pauline’s gaze shifted to the green petticoat bag.

“Re-test?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said. “Side-back seam. Under movement.”

She reached for the bag, then paused—not at the garment, but at Charl.

She watched him for a beat longer than was strictly comfortable.

It was the same evaluation Mara had given him, only Pauline’s was quieter, more intimate in its severity. Like she was deciding whether he was safe to be in the room when nobody was watching.

Charl didn’t puff up. He didn’t shrink.

He simply waited.

Pauline nodded once, then turned to me.

“Je peux montrer,” she said. I can show. Then she corrected herself, because she was always trying, even when she didn’t need to. “I can show… how to hold it. When she moves.”

The word slid out of her mouth with no effort.

She.

Not *he.*

Not *him.*

Not even a stumble toward something neutral.

She said it the way she would say “needle” or “thread” or “steam”—a functional designation, chosen unconsciously because it was the one that made the most sense in the line of work.

My eyes went to Charl without me meaning them to.

He went perfectly still.

Not dramatically. Not offended. Not even visibly confused.

Just—paused, like a dancer hearing the music change key.

His fingers stopped on the pencil. The tip hovered above the paper.

There was a single beat where the room could have turned into a scene.

It didn’t.

Pauline didn’t notice—or, more likely, she noticed and refused to treat it as something worth noticing. That was Pauline’s power. She didn’t grant boys the privilege of making everything about their internal weather.

She unzipped the garment bag with a smooth motion and lifted the petticoat out, shaking it once to let the fabric fall into its proper shape.

“Look,” she said, and held it up. “Here. The seam… she pulls when she step. Not when she stand.”

Charl blinked.

Then, quietly—very quietly—he placed the pencil down and said, “Okay.”

His voice sounded like someone choosing not to panic.

He leaned forward again, and his eyes went straight to the seam as if the pronoun had been nothing more than a tool that pointed him to the correct problem.

Pauline adjusted her grip and demonstrated a small movement: a step, a pivot, the fabric tensioning in the side-back.

“See?” she said. “Here it is. If she do—” She made the motion again, sharper. “—then it open.”

Charl watched the seam, not Pauline. He watched the fabric’s behaviour with that precise, tender focus of his.

“And the fix?” he asked.

Pauline’s gaze sharpened. He’d asked the correct question.

“Not more thread,” she said at once. “Not stronger. It is… how you cut. How you allow. A little… more give here.”

She pinched the fabric with two fingers and indicated the line.

He nodded, already writing in his head.

I could see his throat move—one swallow, contained. Then his shoulders eased by a fraction, as if the act of continuing had steadied him.

Pauline handed the petticoat to him without ceremony.

He took it automatically.

A gesture that would have been impossible a week ago, because he would have been too busy being self-conscious about what he looked like holding it.

Now he simply held it, because it was his job to.

Pauline stepped closer and moved his hands into the correct position, correcting him with a light touch that carried no apology.

“No, like this,” she said. “So she can move and you can see. Hold here.”

He adjusted without protest.

Then, as if she’d been waiting for him to settle into the posture, Pauline said to me, still watching the seam:

“He learn fast. This one.”

Chosen-ness. Delivered like a note on a measurement.

I didn’t reply with warmth. I replied with truth.

“He does,” I said.

Charl’s eyes flicked up for half a second—fast, startled—then returned to the seam. He didn’t try to claim the compliment. He didn’t try to convert it into status. He simply absorbed it and kept working.

Belonging was doing its quiet work.

Pauline pointed to the stress point again.

“Write,” she instructed him, not unkindly. “In ledger. So Mara, she see.”

Charl nodded.

He turned his head slightly toward the ledger and paused.

There was the second blip.

He was deciding whether to correct her. Whether to ask. Whether to make it a thing.

Instead, he did the more courageous, more Wardrobe-compatible action.

He asked for definitions.

“Pauline,” he said, careful, respectful, “when you say ‘she’… do you mean—”

Pauline’s eyes cut to him.

Not hostile.

Just very clear: *we do not waste time.*

“Yes,” she said. “I mean she.”

Charl’s face went hot in a way he couldn’t fully hide. He blinked again, a little too fast. Then he nodded once, as if receiving an instruction.

“Okay,” he said. “Okay.”

Pauline, satisfied, moved on instantly.

“Now write,” she said again. “Failure point. Fix. Re-test. Signed.”

Charl’s hand hovered over the ledger.

He glanced at the signature lines.

A week ago, that would have made him ache with the old fantasy: *signing is belonging, belonging is being needed, being needed is being a man.*

Now, he simply said, “Do I sign?”

Not pleading. Not hopeful. Just procedural.

I shook my head once.

“Not yet,” I said. “You note. Mara and I sign.”

He nodded without flinching.

Then—quietly, almost to himself—he said, “Right. Placed.”

He began to write.

**FAILURE POINTS:** Side-back seam opens under pivot/step; stress shifts with movement, not stance.
**FIX APPLIED:** Adjust cut for give at stress line; reinforce without stiffening.
**RE-TEST:** Required — movement sequence.

Pauline watched over his shoulder, approving of the content, not the identity.

When he finished, she tapped the page once, brisk.

“Good,” she said.

It sounded like a stamp.

Then she turned to me.

“I go steam the blue apron,” she said. “And… tell Lauren: coffee is finished. She forget again.”

“I’ll tell her,” I said.

Pauline left as quietly as she’d come, leaving behind a room that had shifted by half a degree.

Charl kept writing for a moment after she’d gone, as if anchoring himself in ink.

Then he stopped and stared at the ledger.

I didn’t rush him. I didn’t comfort him. I didn’t pretend it hadn’t happened.

I waited.

Finally, he looked up at me.

His expression was strange—part shaken, part… calm. As if something that had been hovering above him for a long time had finally landed, and now he could see its outline.

“She,” he said, testing the word like a chord. “She said it like it was nothing.”

“It was nothing,” I said.

He blinked again, then gave a small, helpless shake of his head, not quite laughing, not quite panicking.

“It didn’t feel like nothing,” he admitted.

“That’s because you still think you’re the centre of the sentence,” I said.

The words were blunt, but my tone wasn’t cruel. It was the same tone I used when I corrected errors: firm, factual, not personal.

His face tightened—then he breathed out and let it go.

“Okay,” he said quietly. “So… what am I supposed to do with it?”

This was the moment to offer certainty.

Not about gender. Not about the future. About the rule.

“The same thing you did just now,” I said. “You keep working.”

He swallowed.

“And if I…” He hesitated. “If I don’t—if I feel wrong about it?”

“Definitions,” I said. “Questions. Clarity. No theatre.”

He nodded. Once.

Then, after a beat, he asked—very softly—“Does she… think I’m one of you?”

I didn’t let that turn into a reassurance scene. I didn’t say yes like a blessing.

I gave him the Wardrobe version again.

“She treated you like you belonged,” I said. “That’s what matters.”

He held my gaze, trying to understand the logic that didn’t care about his feelings more than it cared about the structure.

Then he nodded again—slower this time, as if it cost him something.

“Okay,” he said. “Then… I’ll get used to it.”

The phrase struck the air between us like a bell.

Not because he knew its history.

Because I did.

I didn’t smile. I didn’t sentimentalise it. I only slid the green petticoat toward him again.

“Good,” I said. “Now show me the movement sequence. If we’re going to be right, we’ll be right properly.”

He took the garment, stood, and moved exactly as Pauline had demonstrated—step, pivot, tension, release—eyes on the seam, mind on the standard.

And the room—our room—held him.

Not because anyone had declared it.

Because he behaved like someone who was already inside the “we.”

And Wardrobe, as always, rewarded the only thing it ever rewards:

Correctness.

---

If you want me to continue immediately, the next scene can be a short follow-on in **Lauren POV** (or still Celeste POV) where Lauren hears Pauline used “she” and reacts in that very Lauren way: calm, measured, consequential—no celebration, just an adjustment of how the team speaks because it’s operationally true now.

[Q]  
That would be ideal, Emily. Thank you.
