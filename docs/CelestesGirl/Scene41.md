## Scene 41
### “It’s His Table” (Lauren POV)

The waiting room smelled like disinfectant and old carpet and the faint sweetness of those cheap air fresheners that tried too hard.

Lauren hated waiting rooms. Not because of nerves—she didn’t do nerves, not in public—but because waiting rooms were designed to make adults feel small. Low chairs. Too-bright lighting. Posters that spoke to you like you were twelve.
 
She sat anyway. Upright. Hands folded. Still.

When her name was called, she stood with the same calm she used when walking into a meeting where someone had underestimated her. The receptionist smiled at her in that automatic way. Lauren returned a smaller smile—polite, not inviting.

The psychiatrist’s office was clean in a deliberate way: calm colours, minimal clutter, books arranged to suggest both warmth and authority. The psychiatrist—Dr. Voss—stood to greet her. Middle-aged. Clear-eyed. The kind of person who didn’t waste empathy on performance.

“Ms. Rossignol?” Dr. Voss said.

“Lauren,” she replied, and took the offered seat.

Dr. Voss didn’t begin with a lecture. “Tell me what brings you in.”

Lauren kept her language simple. Not because the psychiatrist needed simple, but because this wasn’t a story.

“I’m here about a young person,” she said. “Eighteen. Works in a female-dominant workplace with strong culture. He’s… changing. And the workplace is at risk of turning that into gossip or pressure. I’m trying to prevent harm.”

Dr. Voss nodded slowly. “You’re not the patient.”

“No,” Lauren said. “And I’m not asking you to diagnose him without him.”

“Good.” Dr. Voss’s voice was crisp. “Then what are you asking?”

“A framing,” Lauren said. “A way to understand what I’m seeing, so I can keep the adults around him from being idiots.”

Dr. Voss’s mouth twitched—approval, disguised as neutrality. “Alright. What are you seeing?”

Lauren chose her words like she chose stitches: functional, clean, no fraying edges.

“He becomes calmer when he’s not being pushed into masculinity,” she said. “Not just socially. In his whole body. Voice, posture, habits. He’s drawn to rituals—skincare, hair, clothing—like they regulate him. He’s increasingly protective of women’s boundaries. Not as a man performing chivalry—more like he’s adopting women’s way of protecting women. Quiet. Consequential.”

Dr. Voss listened without interrupting.

Lauren continued, “And when a man—any man—shows entitlement, he has this… immediate reaction. He doesn’t puff up. He doesn’t posture. He just goes still, and he enforces the boundary in the same language the women do. Like he’s been waiting his whole life to speak that dialect.”

Dr. Voss leaned back slightly. “And what distresses him?”

“Being treated as ‘a bloke’ who should toughen up,” Lauren said. “Any pressure to be more masculine makes him… dim. Withdrawn. Unwell.” She paused. “He’s happier than I’ve ever seen him, lately. And he’s terrified of losing it.”

Dr. Voss’s gaze stayed steady. “Has he used any language about gender?”

Lauren answered honestly. “Not publicly. Not to me.”

Dr. Voss nodded. “And that matters.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “I know.”

Dr. Voss folded their hands. “There are multiple possible explanations for what you’re describing,” they said. “Anxiety response. Trauma history. Relief from social pressure. Or gender dysphoria—specifically, dysphoria around masculinisation, and/or euphoria around femininity.”

Lauren felt a familiar impatience. Not at the psychiatrist—at the world’s habit of complicating what was often painfully clear.

“So how do you tell?” Lauren asked.

Dr. Voss didn’t flinch from the directness. “You don’t tell,” they said. “He tells. The differentiator is his narrative, in his own words, over time. Persistence. Consistency. The sense of alignment versus mere escape.”

Lauren’s hands stayed folded, but her fingers pressed together. “It doesn’t feel like escape,” she said. “It feels like… arriving.”

Dr. Voss’s expression softened, just slightly. “That is a meaningful observation. But it remains an observation.”

Lauren inhaled slowly, steadying. “I’m trying to keep the workplace from pushing him,” she said. “Even in a supportive direction.”

“Good,” Dr. Voss said. “Because pressure is pressure, no matter how pretty the wrapping is.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Exactly.”

Dr. Voss reached for a note pad but didn’t write much. “If he wants to explore this clinically, he needs to come himself,” they said. “And he needs to know he can say ‘no’ without consequences.”

Lauren nodded. “That’s the culture we’re trying to protect.”

Dr. Voss stood. “There’s another professional I’d like you to speak with,” they said. “Not for prescribing anything now. For informed framing.”

The endocrinologist was in an adjacent office, more medical, less cosy, but equally calm. Dr. Singh greeted Lauren with a brisk professionalism.

“You’re not the patient,” Dr. Singh said after Lauren explained the situation.

“No,” Lauren replied. “And I’m not here to shop for hormones.”

“Excellent,” Dr. Singh said, like Lauren had just passed a basic test of decency.

Lauren laid out the same observations again, in the same careful language. Dr. Singh listened, then nodded.

“People bring up estradiol like it’s a suggestion,” Dr. Singh said. “A hint. A nudge. I don’t do hints.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Neither do I.”

Dr. Singh’s mouth twitched. “Good. Estradiol is a medical intervention. Some effects are reversible, many are not, and the timeline varies. It is not prescribed as a reward for fitting a narrative. It’s used when a patient wants it, understands it, and is supported medically and psychologically.”

Lauren held that line in her mind like a rail. *Patient wants it.*

“What I’m describing,” Lauren said, “does it fit classic dysphoria?”

Dr. Singh glanced at Dr. Voss, then back to Lauren. “What you’re describing fits a pattern we see,” Dr. Singh said carefully. “But the diagnosis isn’t made by proxy. The ethical line is consent and agency. If he is consistently more well when expressing femininity, and consistently distressed by masculinising pressure, then yes—gender dysphoria is a possibility. But it is his body. His identity. His choice.”

Dr. Voss added, “It’s his table.”

Lauren felt the tension in her chest ease—not into comfort, but into clarity.

“So the right next step,” Lauren said, “is to invite him to speak to you. No pitch. No plan.”

Dr. Voss nodded. “Yes.”

“And to keep the workplace clean,” Lauren said.

Dr. Singh’s eyes sharpened. “Yes.”

Lauren stood. “Thank you.”

As she left, she felt the familiar weight settle in her hands—responsibility, not drama. The kind that didn’t make you a hero. The kind that made you boring and reliable.

She preferred it that way.



<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

Got you. You’re right to flag it: as written, it starts to read like **a care pathway**, and that’s not what the story needs. What the story needs is **Lauren in her element**—calm, consequential—using professionals not to “solve” Charli, but to **protect agency, privacy, and the workplace culture** from turning someone’s interior life into a project.

I also agree with your instinct about specialists: we can keep it as **one appointment** (or two, but unnamed/undifferentiated), and keep the language deliberately **non-procedural**.

On pronouns: in this scene, Lauren is talking about *her child* in a clinical office, and part of the emotional truth is that she’s navigating language carefully. The cleanest approach is: Lauren uses **Charli’s name** almost exclusively, and when forced into a pronoun, she uses **they**—not as “instructional gender theory,” but as a practical mother move: *privacy + accuracy + not getting ahead of Charli*. It also avoids the “he/him problem” without implying Lauren has fully updated language in every context.

Here’s a full rewrite.

## Scene 41 — “It’s Their Table” (Lauren POV)

The waiting room smelled like disinfectant, old carpet, and the faint sweetness of an air freshener trying to pass for mercy.

Lauren hated waiting rooms.

Not because of nerves—she didn’t do nerves in public—but because waiting rooms were designed to make adults feel small. Low chairs. Bright lights. Posters that spoke in baby-voice to people who paid taxes.

She sat anyway. Upright. Hands folded. Still.

A door opened. A name was called. Lauren stood with the same calm she used when walking into a meeting where she knew—before she spoke—that someone had underestimated her.

The consulting room was tidy in a deliberate way: clean lines, neutral colours, nothing out that looked like it was begging to be noticed. The person behind the desk stood to greet her—middle-aged, clear-eyed, the kind of professional who didn’t waste empathy on theatre.

“Ms. Rossignol?”

“Lauren,” she said, because she was not twelve either.

They gestured to the chair. Lauren sat.

There was no lecture. No warm-up. Just a simple, competent opening.

“Tell me what you’re here for.”

Lauren kept her language clean. This wasn’t a confessional. It wasn’t a memoir. It was containment.

“I’m here about my child,” she said. “Eighteen. Employed. In a workplace that is women-led, high-standard, and—when it’s healthy—very safe. Charli is… in the middle of something. And the risk is that people around Charli will try to help in ways that become pressure.”

The clinician nodded once, slow. “You’re not asking me to diagnose someone who isn’t here.”

“No,” Lauren said. “I’m asking for a frame. A way to hold this without people turning it into gossip, or a crusade, or a makeover.”

“Good,” they said, and Lauren felt, briefly, the relief of being taken seriously.

They leaned back slightly. “Tell me what you’ve observed.”

Lauren chose her words the way she chose stitches: functional. Strong. No fraying edges.

“When Charli is pushed toward masculinity—socially, emotionally, even casually—Charli gets smaller,” she said. “Not sulky. Not rebellious. Just… dimmer. Less present. Less well.”

The clinician’s gaze didn’t waver. “And when that pressure isn’t there?”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Charli steadies.”

She paused, then went on because it mattered that she said the part that made her proud, even if pride was not the point.

“Charli is learning maintenance,” she said. “Basic care. Routine. Structure. Not for attention. For function. Charli moves differently now. Like someone who belongs in their own skin more often than not.”

A small silence, weighted. The clinician let it exist.

“And what about distress?” they asked. “What’s the red flag that brought you here now?”

Lauren didn’t flinch from the truth.

“Fear,” she said. “Fear of bodily changes. Fear of being pushed into a shape that doesn’t fit. Charli tried to manage it alone. Secretly.”

The clinician’s eyes sharpened by a fraction. “Medically?”

Lauren held their gaze. “Yes.”

Another pause. The room tightened—not into drama, into seriousness.

The clinician folded their hands. “Thank you for being direct.”

Lauren nodded once. She didn’t want sympathy. She wanted competence.

The clinician asked a few questions—not invasive, not prying, just enough to locate the risk without turning Charli into a case study.

“Is Charli safe now?”
“Yes.”
“Are the substances secured?”
“Yes.”
“Does Charli know you’re here?”
“Yes.”
“Do you have consent to talk in general terms?”
“I do.”

That last one mattered. Lauren felt it land like a rail.

The clinician’s voice stayed calm. “Here’s the frame,” they said. “When a young adult is distressed about their body in a way that leads to secrecy and risk, the first job is safety. The second job is agency.”

Lauren’s fingers pressed together, tight. “Agency.”

“Yes,” the clinician said. “Not yours. Not mine. Not the workplace’s. Charli’s.”

Lauren exhaled through her nose. “That’s what I’m trying to protect.”

The clinician nodded. “Then you need to protect it from two equal dangers.”

Lauren lifted her chin. “Which are?”

“Dismissal,” the clinician said. “And recruitment.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched—humourless approval.

“Dismissal looks like: ‘It’s a phase, toughen up, stop being dramatic.’ Recruitment looks like: ‘We know what you are, we know what you need, come join our story.’”

Lauren’s eyes hardened. “Yes.”

“Both steal the same thing,” the clinician continued. “The right to go at Charli’s pace. The right to have uncertainty without punishment.”

Lauren held that sentence and felt something inside her settle into place.

“So what do I do?” she asked. “In real terms.”

The clinician didn’t give her a manifesto. They gave her a plan that wasn’t a plan—guardrails. The kind of boring, reliable structure Lauren trusted.

“You do three things,” they said.

“One: you keep medical risk out of secrecy. That means a supervised path, if any path is taken at all. It means no improvising. No ‘help’ sourced from fear.”

Lauren nodded once. “Done.”

“Two,” they said, “you separate identity from emergency. Charli doesn’t need to decide a label to deserve care. Distress is enough. Safety is enough.”

Lauren felt her throat tighten, unexpectedly. Not tears. A mother’s rage at how many people demanded a declaration before they offered help.

“Yes,” she said.

“Three,” the clinician said, “you protect Charli’s social environment from becoming a stage.”

Lauren leaned forward slightly. “Meaning Wardrobe.”

“Meaning any place Charli lives,” the clinician corrected, gently but firmly. “People are going to have opinions. People will think their feelings are guidance. Your job is to keep the air clean.”

Lauren’s jaw set. “How.”

The clinician met her eyes. “Simple rule. Repeatable rule. The kind a workplace can actually hold.”

Lauren waited.

The clinician said, “No one discusses Charli’s body as a topic. No one treats Charli’s identity as a group project. No one uses private information as bonding material. And if Charli chooses to speak, the only correct response is: ‘Thank you for trusting me. What do you need?’”

Lauren sat back. The rule was clean. It had edges. It could be enforced.

She liked it.

“And if Charli doesn’t speak?” Lauren asked.

“Then you don’t speak for Charli,” the clinician said, without softness. “You keep the room safe anyway.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “That’s… harder.”

“Yes,” the clinician said. “It’s also the whole job.”

Lauren sat in the quiet for a beat, letting the truth land in her bones.

Then she asked the thing that had been sitting behind everything else, sharp as a tack.

“What if the women at Wardrobe are supportive but… too enthusiastic?”

The clinician didn’t smile. They didn’t pretend enthusiasm was harmless.

“Then you treat it like any other boundary breach,” they said. “Same as you would if it were men. Same as you would if it were cruelty. Pressure is pressure, Lauren. Pretty pressure still bruises.”

Lauren felt a low, fierce gratitude.

“Good,” she said.

The clinician’s gaze softened by a fraction—not pity, recognition.

“Charli needs to sit at the head of the table,” they said. “Everyone else can be invited. No one else gets to take the seat.”

Lauren nodded once.

“It’s their table,” she said, tasting the sentence like a vow.

“Yes,” the clinician replied. “Exactly.”

Lauren stood. She didn’t gush. She didn’t overthank. She didn’t perform relief.

“Thank you,” she said, because gratitude did not need decoration.

The clinician nodded. “Bring Charli in when Charli is ready. And until then—keep the environment clean.”

Lauren left the office with the familiar weight settling into her hands: responsibility, not drama. The kind that didn’t make you a hero. The kind that made you boring and reliable.

She preferred it that way.

Outside, the wind had teeth. Lauren zipped her coat, stepped into the cold, and felt her resolve tighten like a seam pulled true.

No more secrecy.

No more heroics.

No more people using Charli’s life as a story they could tell about themselves.

Standards.

Agency.

And a table that belonged—finally—to the person who’d been carrying everyone else’s expectations on their back.

If you want title options that fit your tone and don’t sound medical:

* **“It’s Their Table”** (clean, thematic, repeats well later)
* **“Guardrails”** (Lauren-ish: practical, stern)
* **“No Recruitment”** (sharp, memorable)
* **“Keep the Air Clean”** (Wardrobe-coded, policy-coded)

If you paste your current Scene 41 draft back into your doc, I’d go with **“It’s Their Table”**—it’s the kind of phrase your story can reuse later as a quiet doctrine.
