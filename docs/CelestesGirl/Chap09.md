# Talia

Option B is *absolutely* the more credible, more “women’s world” move — because it’s exactly how women calibrate safety: not by gossiping loudly, but by **checking the social map** with the person who holds authority in the space.

And it does something else you’ll love: it lets Celeste’s humanity show through what she chooses to reveal, what she withholds, and *how quickly* she reads what Talia is really asking.

Below is a scene that keeps everything in **Celeste’s POV**, lets Talia’s question land with real weight, and quietly advances the companion arc without making it a spectacle.

## Celeste — The Check-In

Talia came back at an hour that wasn’t convenient on purpose.

That was the first thing I noticed.

Not during a rush, not in the minutes before she had to go on, not with an audience of other performers hovering for drama. She arrived in the thin seam between tasks, when Wardrobe was busy but not burning—when the room had enough oxygen for a private question.

She didn’t announce herself. She didn’t knock like she was begging. She simply stepped into the doorway, cap in her hands, and waited until I looked up.

I let her wait one beat longer than politeness required. Not to punish her. To see whether she’d fill the silence with apology.

She didn’t.

Good.

“Celeste,” she said. Not urgent. Not flirtatious. Just a name placed carefully on the table between us.

“Yes?” I replied, pen poised over the inventory sheet.

Her eyes flicked, briefly, to the folding screen in the corner—like the memory still lived there. Then back to me.

“I wanted to ask something,” she said.

I set the pen down. “Ask.”

Talia’s shoulders rose slightly, then lowered again. She was choosing her words the way you choose your footing on a slippery path.

“Charlie,” she said.

I didn’t look toward him, even though I knew exactly where he was—at the mending table, hands busy, posture quiet. I didn’t want this to turn into performance for his benefit.

“What about him?” I asked, neutral.

Talia’s mouth tightened. “I’m not… accusing. I’m not trying to start anything.”

“Then don’t,” I said, gently but firm. “Just say what you mean.”

She exhaled through her nose, half-laugh, half-surrender. “Right. Okay.”

Then, with a kind of blunt honesty that made me like her more, she said, “Who is he to you?”

There it was.

Not “is he safe?” Not “why is there a boy in Wardrobe?” Not even “what’s his deal?”—the usual soft-edged ways women are taught to ask for safety without looking like they need it.

She asked the map question.

*Where does he sit in your orbit? How do I categorise him? What do your rules do with him?*

I kept my face calm. Inside, something in me gave a small, irritated click—because the question revealed what I’d already sensed: other women could see the shape forming around me.

“He’s Wardrobe,” I said simply.

Talia blinked. “That’s… not an answer.”

“It is,” I replied. “It’s the only one that matters in this room.”

Her gaze held mine. She wasn’t challenging me. She was trying to understand the difference between policy and personality.

“I’m asking because—” she began, then stopped.

I waited. Again, I didn’t rescue her from her own sentence. Women are always rescuing people socially. I refuse to make that my default.

Talia finished anyway. “Because yesterday could’ve been… bad. And it wasn’t.”

I nodded once. “I know.”

Her jaw flexed. “He didn’t look.”

I said nothing.

“He didn’t hover,” she added, quieter. “He didn’t… make me feel like I had to manage him.”

That last one was the real point. Not gaze. Not bodies. Not sex. Emotional labour.

I let that land.

Then I said, carefully, “He’s trained.”

Talia’s shoulders lowered a fraction. Relief, that quick and guilty relief women feel when something dangerous turns out not to be.

“By you,” she said.

“Yes.”

“And he’ll always stay outside the screen?”

“Yes,” I said again, and my voice hardened slightly—not with threat, but with certainty. “He doesn’t cross it. He doesn’t enter private space unless I say he does, and I won’t say it unless it’s necessary and controlled.”

Talia nodded, absorbing.

Then she asked, because she was brave enough to ask it directly: “Do you trust him?”

I didn’t answer too fast. Trust isn’t a sticker you hand out. It’s a structure.

“I trust his behaviour,” I said. “I trust that he follows the rules. I trust that if he doesn’t know what to do, he stops instead of improvising. And I trust that he doesn’t turn bodies into stories.”

Talia watched me like she was weighing every word for sincerity.

“And him?” she pressed. “As a person.”

That was the second layer: the one women ask when they’re trying to decide if the system will protect them even when the system’s owner is tired.

I let my eyes flick, briefly, to the mending table. Charlie was stitching with his head down, not listening, not performing. He looked like someone who had learned the relief of being given an instruction that makes sense.

I looked back to Talia.

“He’s not here to be indulged,” I said. “And he’s not here to be punished. He’s here because he’s useful and because he respects the room.”

Talia’s mouth softened. “That’s… a good answer.”

“It’s a true one.”

She hesitated, then said quietly, “When you sent him out with you—on the donor path—was that part of this? Training?”

I met her eyes. “Yes.”

Talia let out a slow breath. “Okay.”

She didn’t look angry. If anything, she looked grateful to have it named. Women prefer clarity. It’s safer than charm.

Then she said, almost reluctant, “He looks at you like he believes you.”

There it was again—the line I’d heard in my own head, now spoken aloud by someone else, which made it feel less like a private thought and more like a visible fact.

I felt that same small sour flicker rise—annoyance, not at Charlie, not at Talia.

At myself.

Because she wasn’t wrong.

I kept my voice even. “That’s because I give him rules that work.”

Talia tilted her head. “You don’t think it’s… more than that?”

I didn’t laugh. I didn’t bristle. I didn’t pretend to be above implication.

I answered like a strategist.

“I think,” I said, “that when you remove chaos from someone’s life, they become attached to the hand that did it.”

Talia’s eyes widened slightly, a recognition of something she’d seen before.

“And that worries you?” she asked.

It wasn’t a challenge. It was—woman to woman—an offer to name a danger without making it shameful.

I paused.

Then I said the truth that mattered: “It makes me careful.”

Talia nodded once. That was enough.

She glanced toward the door, as if remembering she’d come here with a purpose and now had it.

“Thank you,” she said.

“You’re welcome,” I replied.

She started to turn away, then stopped.

“One more thing,” she said.

“Yes?”

“If—” she swallowed, “if anyone gives him trouble for being here… for being in kit… for being around us…”

Her voice tightened around the old expectation: that women should simply absorb discomfort and be grateful nothing worse happened.

I cut through it gently.

“They don’t,” I said. “And if they try, you tell me.”

Talia’s eyes searched my face. She found no ambiguity there.

“Alright,” she said. “I will.”

She left quietly, cap still in her hands, posture steadier than when she’d entered.

I picked up my pen again and returned to the inventory as if nothing had happened, because Wardrobe does not pause for philosophy.

But the conversation had left a mark anyway—not on paper. In my awareness.

Other women were noticing Charlie.

Not as a spectacle.

As a risk profile. As a boundary variable. As a new element in the room that could either cost them safety or preserve it.

And the fact that Talia had come to *me* about it meant one thing very clearly:

I wasn’t just running costumes anymore.

I was running a standard.

I glanced, once, toward the mending table.

Charlie didn’t look up. He didn’t sense me watching. He just stitched—small, flat, strong—making something hold.

He was calm in a way he hadn’t been this morning.

Because he trusted the rules.

Because he trusted me.

And that, inconveniently, was beginning to be useful far beyond Wardrobe.

---

If you want the next beat after this, the cleanest progression is: **someone tries to test the boundary** in public (a patron or staffer makes a “joke”), and Charlie uses Celeste’s policy sentence—calmly—to shut it down. Celeste sees, in real time, that he can now *carry her standard without her standing beside him*. That’s when “constant companion” becomes less a role and more a lever.
