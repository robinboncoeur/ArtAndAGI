Exactly — *that* is the sweet spot.

If Celeste were simply omniscient and untroubled, she’d read as a fantasy “control-goddess,” which is fun for the wrong audience and flat for the right one. But when she has that flicker of irritation at her own noticing — the moment she realises “I’m building a reliance” and it annoys her because she prefers to think she’s self-contained — she becomes human **without losing authority**.

That’s the kind of power that feels real: not loud, not performative, not “look at me,” but structural.

Two small craft notes to keep this potent and on-tone as you go:

### 1) Make Celeste’s self-awareness *instrumental*, not confessional

She doesn’t sit around feeling guilty. She registers the dependency the way she registers a missing waistcoat: as a variable in her system.

So her internal voice stays like:

* *This is effective.*
* *This is dangerous.*
* *This is mine to manage.*

Not:

* *Oh no, what am I becoming?*

### 2) Let her humanity show through restraint, not softness

Her kindness reads best when it is:

* protective policy,
* calm framing,
* withholding spectacle,
* refusing gossip,
* giving Charlie language and boundaries.

That’s “care” expressed as competence — which is, frankly, the most persuasive kind.

If you want the next beat, I’d make it **a slightly sharper test** that still starves prurience:

* a performer needs an emergency change behind a screen,
* a staff member tries to bar Charlie from the space (“no men back here”), and
* Celeste asserts: “He’s Wardrobe. He’s not a man in here — he’s *function*.”

And then the key: Charlie behaves impeccably — eyes down when appropriate, hands only where instructed, no flustering, no “this is awkward” performance. The scene becomes an indictment of anyone who *wants* it to be awkward.

Whenever you’re ready, I can write that next.




## ThAt Seam Incident

The thing about a “calm day” at the Faire is that it’s always calm right up until it isn’t.

We’d been on the donor path for fifteen minutes when I saw the problem coming toward us in the shape of a girl walking too quickly.

Not running. Trying not to.

That particular kind of speed is always trouble.

Her cap was askew, her cheeks flushed, and she had that tight, contained expression performers get when they’re holding a private disaster inside their ribs. She clocked me, made a beeline, and stopped just close enough to be urgent without touching.

“Celeste,” she said, voice thin. “I need… I need you. Now.”

I didn’t ask *why* like it was gossip. I asked like it was triage.

“What is it?”

She swallowed. “Skirt seam. It’s— it’s gone.”

“Where are you?”

“Near the weaving hut. I can’t— I can’t go back out like this.”

I nodded once. “You won’t.”

Behind her, someone hovered: Nora, the floor coordinator, lanyard and anxiety, already preparing to turn this into a drama by explaining it to everyone within earshot.

I cut that off.

“Nora,” I said, without looking at her. “Cover the hut for ten minutes. Tell the audience it’s a tool reset. Do not add adjectives.”

Nora blinked. “I—yes. Alright.”

The performer—Talia, I remembered now—looked at me with a sort of startled relief, like I’d just told her gravity had been cancelled.

I turned slightly, and Charlie was already there.

Not intruding. Not gawping. Just… present in the right place, noticing what I noticed.

“Charlie,” I said.

“Yes,” he replied instantly.

“Wardrobe kit,” I said. “Needle, thread, pins.”

His hand was already on the pouch. “Yes.”

I didn’t smile. I didn’t need to. The system was working.

We moved briskly—no running, no flapping—toward Wardrobe, because the wardrobe room was the only space on the grounds where bodies were treated as normal and failure was treated as fixable.

As we walked, Talia kept her hands behind her, holding fabric in place like she was trying to hold her dignity together by force.

It was the oldest trick in the book, and it never should have been necessary.

I didn’t let the world make it a spectacle.

“Eyes forward,” I told her. “If anyone looks, they’re looking at their own manners.”

She made a sound that could have been a laugh if it wasn’t so close to panic.

Behind us, Nora scuttled away to cover the hut. The donors would have their little reset story. They would not have this one.

We reached the Wardrobe door and I unlocked it with a confidence that calmed people without me having to perform comfort.

Inside, the air shifted showily into order: drawers, rails, the scent of clean cloth and quiet labour.

Mara looked up from her table and immediately read the room.

“What now,” she said, already annoyed at the universe.

“Talia’s skirt seam failed,” I said. “Screen.”

Mara’s expression sharpened. “Right.”

She stood without fuss and pulled the folding screen into a more protected angle—blocking sight lines from the door, creating a corridor of privacy like she’d done it a hundred times.

Because she had.

Talia’s breath shuddered out. She moved behind the screen, shoulders tight.

Charlie stopped at the threshold like he’d hit an invisible line.

Good.

A heartbeat later, another body appeared in the doorway: Dean.

Not the man from committee. Not the donor. This was Dean the newly-promoted “Operations Assistant,” which meant he was drunk on the idea of authority and allergic to context. He was in modern jeans and a polo shirt with the Faire logo, and his eyes flicked to the screen with immediate suspicion.

“What’s going on?” he demanded, as if it were his right to know.

I didn’t turn fully to him. I didn’t elevate him by giving him all of my attention.

“Wardrobe incident,” I said. “We’re handling it.”

He took another step in, gaze hunting. “Is there a woman changing?”

Mara’s mouth tightened. Charlie went still beside me, and I felt the old societal script reaching for him—*male body equals threat.*

It would have been easy, in that moment, for Charlie to apologise for existing. To make himself small, to signal harmlessness with shame.

Instead, he stayed exactly where I’d placed him. Eyes lowered. Hands visible. Not performing innocence—simply behaving correctly.

I turned to Dean fully now.

“You don’t come past the screen,” I said, voice level.

Dean’s brows rose in offended disbelief. “I’m staff.”

“So am I,” I replied. “And in this room, I’m the boundary.”

He glanced at Charlie. “And he’s what?”

Charlie’s throat moved, but he didn’t speak. He waited. That was discipline. That was trust.

I answered for him, because this was not Charlie’s job to justify.

“He’s Wardrobe support,” I said. “He doesn’t cross the screen. He doesn’t look. He doesn’t touch. He’s here because he has hands and training and he follows instructions.”

Dean’s face twisted, trying to decide whether he could weaponise policy.

“It’s not appropriate,” he said, seizing the first moral-sounding word he could find. “Having a—having a boy in here when a woman is—”

I cut him off cleanly, because this is how you prevent nonsense: you don’t let it build a nest.

“This is not a morality play,” I said. “This is a seam.”

Dean blinked.

Mara made a small sound behind me—approval, almost against her will.

Dean tried again, puffing up. “There are rules. You can’t just—”

“I can,” I said. “And if you want to learn our rules, you can start with the simplest one.”

I stepped slightly to block his line of sight to the screen.

“You do not turn someone’s body into a public conversation,” I told him. “Not on my floor. Not in my room.”

His mouth opened.

I didn’t give him time.

“If you need to feel useful,” I added, “go stand on the path and stop patrons wandering into staff-only areas. That would help.”

Dean’s cheeks reddened. He looked at Mara, perhaps expecting her to back him. Mara stared back at him with the flat expression of a woman who had spent years cleaning up after men’s opinions.

Dean looked away.

He backed out of the doorway with the stiff posture of someone retreating while trying to pretend it was his idea. “Fine. But—this is… risky.”

“It’s controlled,” I replied, and shut the door in his face.

Not hard. Just final.

The room exhaled.

Behind the screen, Talia’s voice trembled. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” I said, briskly. “Tell me where.”

“Back seam,” she said. “I felt it… give.”

“Alright,” I said. “Mara, lamp.”

Mara moved to the task without commentary. She positioned the lamp so it cast light where it was needed and nowhere else.

I turned to Charlie.

He was still at his station—two steps back from the screen, exactly where he belonged. Eyes down. Breathing controlled. Hands relaxed at his sides.

Not anxious in a performative way. Not curious. Not “trying to be good.” Just good.

That mattered more than people understood.

“Charlie,” I said softly.

He lifted his eyes to mine only—not to the screen. “Yes.”

“Thread. Dark,” I said. “Needle size small. Pins.”

He moved to the drawer, retrieved exactly what I asked for, and returned them to me without looking anywhere else.

His restraint wasn’t prudish. It wasn’t shame. It was respect expressed as behaviour.

I took the supplies from his hands.

“Stay there,” I told him. “You’re my runner. If I ask for something, you bring it. If I don’t, you don’t move.”

“Yes,” he said.

Behind the screen, I could hear fabric shifting as Talia held the torn seam closed for me. She was doing what women always do when something fails: making herself smaller to survive it.

I hated that.

Not at her. At the world that made it normal.

“Breathe,” I told her, businesslike. “Hold the fabric where I tell you. You’re not in trouble.”

A small, shaky exhale.

Mara hovered by the table, arms crossed, watching me work with that permanent half-frown of someone who respected competence but resisted affection.

I knelt, reached around the screen edge only as far as necessary—no wandering hands, no drama—and found the tear by touch of fabric, not by intrusion.

“Here,” I said, and guided Talia’s fingers to the correct hold. “Pinch that. Good. Don’t pull. Let me do the tension.”

I stitched quickly—small, flat, strong—like suturing something that needed to endure movement.

Outside, the Faire carried on like nothing had happened, which was the whole point. Inside, a woman got to keep her dignity intact, which was the deeper point.

When the seam was secure, I gave it one gentle tug to test it.

“Stand still,” I said.

Talia stood.

“Step,” I instructed. “One step forward. Good. One step back. Good. Twist.”

She twisted cautiously.

The seam held.

Her breath broke into something that might have been laughter if it weren’t so close to tears.

“Oh my God,” she whispered. “I thought I was going to die out there.”

“You weren’t,” I said. “You were going to be inconvenienced. That’s all.”

I stood, dusted my hands, and stepped back.

“Alright,” I said. “You’re contained. Drink water. Sit for one minute. Then you go back out and pretend nothing happened.”

Talia’s voice softened. “Thank you. Truly.”

“Don’t thank me,” Mara muttered before she could stop herself. “Thank the person who didn’t make it weird.”

Talia went quiet for a beat.

Then, from behind the screen, she said cautiously, “Who’s in the room?”

I answered before anyone else could.

“Charlie,” I said. “Wardrobe support. He didn’t move.”

Talia paused, then said, plainly, “Thank you, Charlie.”

Charlie’s throat bobbed.

He kept his gaze low. He didn’t bask. He didn’t do the helpless “oh it was nothing” act that begs for validation.

He simply said, clear and steady, “You’re welcome.”

Mara looked at him as if seeing him anew, irritation flickering into something else—something like reluctant respect.

The moment passed, because Wardrobe does not sentimentalise itself.

Talia emerged from behind the screen, cap straight now, posture restored. She gave Charlie a quick glance—not of judgement, not of coyness. Of acknowledgement. Worker to worker.

Then she left.

When the door closed behind her, the room returned to its hum.

Mara leaned on the table and exhaled. “Well,” she said, as though the word tasted strange. “He didn’t flinch.”

“He didn’t perform,” I corrected.

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Same thing.”

“No,” I said, and I meant it. “It’s not.”

I turned to Charlie.

He was still where I’d left him. Still. Controlled. Not vibrating with adrenaline, not fishing for praise, not collapsing into shame after proximity to something society teaches boys to treat as illicit.

He looked… tired, in a quiet way. Focused.

“Charlie,” I said.

“Yes.”

“You did well,” I told him.

He swallowed. “I just… stood there.”

“Yes,” I said. “And you did it correctly.”

That was the point I wanted to nail into his bones: restraint can be competence. Respect can be action.

His eyes lifted to mine, and something flickered in them—a small, startled pride that didn’t know how to take up space yet.

I kept my face neutral.

Then I handed him the needle tin and said, “Put these back. Log the thread usage. Then come with me.”

He blinked. “Where?”

“Floor,” I said, already turning back to my clipboard. “We’ve lost ten minutes. We’re not losing the day.”

He nodded and moved.

And as he fell into step behind me again—quiet, useful, uninteresting to the wrong eyes—I felt that irritating clarity return:

This wasn’t just a boy who obeyed.

This was a person who could be trusted in spaces where trust mattered.

A constant.

Not yet named.

But already forming.
