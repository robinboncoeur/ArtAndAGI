## Unemployed

"The best way to a successful career is by going to university."

Charlie wasn't really paying attention to the jobs clerk at the unemployment agency. Her outfit and perfectly manicured hands spoke of money and prestige: Mabel was working at the agency as "doing something to give back", as she put it to her posh friends.

She wouldn't have a clue as to how the 'other half' live, nor would it have interested her.

Charlie had neither money nor connections: university was out of the question. Even if his parents hadn't kicked him out—'You're old enough to be self-sufficient. Time to learn a trade!' his dad had declared, as if that solved everything—his aunt, who he was temporarily living with, had no resources nor any intention to help him beyond giving him a place to stay... 'for a while' she had reminded him. He felt lonely: adrift. And now this lady talked about university, like 'uni' was a given.

"Pay attention!" Her sharp voice snapped him out of his thoughts. He looked up quickly, meeting her frown.  "You haven't heard a word I said, have you?"

"I'm sorry," he stammered. "You were talking about... university?"

Mabel sighed, consulting the open folder in front of him before looking back up. "Yes, university. But you need to focus if we're going to find a solution for you." She shook her head as she looked at his folder. "Your grades... my-my-my." She stared at him. "What sort of future do you think you have with grades like this, Charlie? They're deplorable!"

He hung his head.

"My dad thinks I should learn a trade..."

Mabel snorted. "I don't mean to sound skeptical, but I can't see any trade that would suit your, um, somewhat delicate build. You'd fit in much better in..." She paused, her eyes widening. She put a finger to her lips and looked at Charlie with a sudden spark of inspiration. "Charlie, I have *just* the sort of work for you that would suit you to a 'T'." She paused, letting that sink in. "Yes, indeed! I see from your school transcripts that your strengths seem to lie in music and history. This position I'm offering would leverage both."

He smiled hopefully. "What sort of job is it?"

Her face shone with a curious smile that hinted at a peculiar idea.
        
"Have you ever heard of the 'Chateau Fleur de Lys' in Thornton? It's sort-of a history fair, I suppose you could call it."

"Um, I'm not exactly sure where Thornton is, actually..."

"New South Wales."

He started; New South Wales was on the other side of the country! 

He was about to protest when Mabel cut in. "You'd be living on the premises. They provide housing and meals, and you even get paid." 'Most likely a pittance,' she thought to herself, but if he was frugal, he could eventually save up enough for training somewhere else, when he was a bit more mature and had a clearer idea of what he wanted to do.

She congratulated herself for 'killing two birds with one stone': the lad before her was exactly the type Kathy was looking for.

"A friend of mine runs the place, and she's here on holidays. She could give you a ride back in her combivan. She’s been looking for new talent and has found several young people keen on being a part of 'Fleur de Lys'. You’d be just the ticket to round out her new troupe." She smiled at him. "Don't *miss this bus*, Charlie: it's your ticket to the future. Oh, by the way, your boss goes by the name 'Miss Kathy'. If you want to start off on a good foot with her, I'd address her by that name. She's a bit funny that way."

He waited anxiously that windy morning for the combi-van to arrive. Standing on a street corner in the early hours of a Perth morning, he felt utterly out of place. The streets were nearly deserted since businesses in Perth usually started later to align with the east coast's time. But it wasn’t the early hour that made him uneasy—it was the handbag.

With no travel bag for his few belongings, his aunt had insisted he take her large beige leather purse. He recognized it instantly and its unmistakably feminine appearance made him cringe. If only it had been black, he thought, he wouldn't have felt so conspicuous. As the morning was a bit chilly, she had 'generously' given him a cardigan to wear: it was only as he stood waiting for the combivan that he realised the cardigan and the handbag matched. He realised this was his aunt's retribution for his perceived ingratitude just the week before.

When the van finally pulled up, he saw it was full of an animated group of young ladies and a driver, who he figured was Miss Kathy. He climbed in, and plopped motionless into the corner of the back seat, squeezed in next to Emma, who still had her boots on.

The VW combivan had been buzzing with excitement as the young women eagerly discussed their upcoming roles at the 'history fair' and this continued upabated as they moved on down the road to the highway.

“Oh my goodness, I can’t wait to try on the costumes! Just imagine us in those beautiful dresses!” exclaimed Sarah, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.

"I know, right?" chimed in Jessica, flipping her hair over her shoulder. "I was totally into, like, the goth-grunge thing, right? But this is going to be like stepping right into the seventeen-eighties! I’ve always dreamed of wearing those gorgeous gowns, corsets and petticoats."

“Totally! The petticoats, the corsets, the intricate lace! We’re going to look so elegant,” replied Emma, practically bouncing in her seat.

“Don’t forget the hats and the gloves! I’ve always wanted to wear, like, those big, feathered hats. They’re so dramatic!” added Lucy, her voice filled with delight.

“And the jewelry! I heard they have these gorgeous pearl necklaces and brooches. We’re going to be the belles of the ball!” chimed in Chloe, her smile wide and infectious.

"I've heard the fabrics are authentic too," added Sarah, leaning forward from the backseat. "Silk, brocade, and velvet! Just thinking about it makes me feel like a princess."

"Well, these dresses have a lot of flair," said Emma, her eyes twinkling. "I'm keen to try on something that really stands out, you know? Maybe something in a bold color or with a dramatic bustle."

Kathy, steering the van with confident hands, glanced in the rearview mirror and grinned. "Don’t worry, Emma, I’m sure we’ll all find something fabulous. The costume department has some amazing staff! They will fit you perfectly to suit your roles at the fair. And just think: that's all you ever wear. We'll be sure to get you several dresses, in different fabrics and styles. All day, every day... you will look and feel fabulous."

Charlie sat quietly in the back, clutching the leather handbag. He shifted uncomfortably, trying to blend into the background. Kathy glanced in the rearview mirror and noticed Charlie’s awkward silence.

"Hey, Charlie, isn’t it? Are you excited about the costume you're going to wear?" she asked, her tone warm but curious.

Charlie nodded hesitantly, his blush deepening. “I'm sure it will be... great,” he replied softly.

The girls turned their attention to him, their curiosity piqued. “Charlie, huh? You’re awfully quiet, Sharl,” Emma teased, playfully elbowing him in the ribs.

“Yeah, so quiet!" Sarah added with a giggle. She turned to the other girls and whispered: "He's so small! 'Sharl'—perfect name for him. Why, he's every bit as quiet as my teddie-bear at home. You know, I reckon he's smaller than any of us, too!" Her whisper was loud enough that he could hear: he blushed bright red instantly.

Lucy leaned over Emma to inspect Charlie more closely. “You know, Sharl, I'll just *bet* you'd be *just* the right size to fit into some of those dresses,” she said with a mischievous grin. "Totally!"

Chloe’s eyes lit up with the idea. “Oh, we will *so* make him try on one of the dresses! Imagine how adorable he will look!”

Charlie’s eyes widened, and he shook his head. This wasn't good. “Um, no, I sort-of don’t think that’s a good idea at all,” he stammered, feeling his cheeks heat up.

“Why not? It’ll be fun!” Emma teased. “Besides, what’s this?" She pointed at the large handbag. "Is that your travel bag, Sharl? Or your *hand*-bag?"

Charlie's blush deepened, and he nodded sheepishly. "Well, it’s my aunt's. She made me..."

The girls interrupted him with peals of laughter. "That’s adorable!" Jessica said. "A leather handbag! You *do* realise you're carrying a *woman's* handbag, *Sharl*,” she added knowingly, with a wink to the others.

The girls' laughter grew, and Charlie tried to hide his embarrassment. “Well, it’s not *really* a handbag... it’s just my travel bag,” he muttered.

Sarah snorted. “Oh, come on, Sharl! You're talking to *women*, here: we recognise a *hand*-bag when we see it!" She smiled condescendingly at him as he cast his eyes downward in embarrassment. "It's okay, Sharl," she added soothingly. "To be honest, it suits you. We’ll find the perfect dress for you to go with it.” She winked at the others, who giggled.

“And maybe some accessories to match!” Lucy added in mock seriousness, "You know, we really do need to do something with your hair, Sharl: it's a fright! It would so much better done up in like a chignon or something." The girls greeted this suggestion with exclamations of approval and a few titters.


![Charlie](https://www.tightbytes.com/art/images/Celeste01/Delicat05b.jpg){: align=left width=450 }



Lucy took a picture of him sitting in his seat, and turning to her phone was busy for a few minutes before turning to Emma.

"Have a look," she said with a smirk. Emma stared at the picture on the phone: it was of a girl sitting in exactly the same pose as Charlie. What amazed her was that the girl had Charlie's face: it *was* Charlie! "How did you *do* that?"

"Looks just like her, er, him, doesn't it?" Lucy grinned. Emma shook her head in amazement as the other girls clamoured to see. When Sarah had a glimpse of the image, she clapped her hands over her mouth, staring at Charlie, then her eyes darted back at the picture on the phone.

"It's totally her!" she exclaimed breathlessly.

"Him."

"Yeah, him, but with boobs!" She grinned at Lucy. "Where did you get the original picture? I mean, Charlie doesn't really have boobs like that..."

"Not yet, anyway. I got it off Pinterest. This app is just *so* easy to use, too."

"Wow, Sharl could really work as a girl," Chloe whispered thoughtfully to Jessica. "Seriously, I think he'd be much more um, something... look, he sucks as a guy, but as a girl, I reckon he'd do well. Don't you think so?"

"I agree," Emma replied, "but good luck convincing him."

Lucy leaned over and said in a stage whisper, as she wanted Charlie to hear her: "We don't have to convince him. I totally think he'll just do as we tell him!" She winked at Charlie. "Won't you, Sharl? C'mon, tell us... you would be a good little, er, boy, or something, and do as you're told! After all, you let your aunt make you use her handbag as a travel bag, didn't you? You're used to being told what to do..." 
        
She paused, and added with emphasis: "...by women!"
        
Charlie's blush deepened. Lucy had hit a raw nerve.

As Kathy navigated the lonely road, her thoughts were on Charlie and his upcoming role. Mabel had been promising her the perfect subject for her objectives. When Charlie had climbed into the van, Kathy was overwhelmed with delight: Mabel had exceeded expectations. She had expected a waif, a rough-and-tumble urchin who would have to be polished, trained, broken-in, like some of the brumbies that came to the lake on the far side of the Foire for a drink.

Instead, who should be climbing into her combivan but this frail, delicate little person, more dainty than any of the young ladies in the van. She smiled to herself. Charlie represented the sort of challenge she loved to undertake. He possessed just the little touch of the mysterious which had been missing in the fabric of "Fleur de Lys": the 'Francois De Choisy' aspect to make the endeavour complete.

As they rolled through the barren countryside, the van buzzed with laughter and light-hearted banter. The girls’ excitement and Charlie’s flustered attempts to fend off their teasing blended into a lively, unforgettable ride.

## Motor Inn


![Charlie](https://www.tightbytes.com/art/images/Celeste01/Delicat09b.jpg){: align=right width=450 }



After almost four-hundred kilometres of travel through semi-desert, Kathy thought it a good idea to call it a day. They pulled in to the hotel at Sothern Cross. Kathy left the girls and Charlie in the car while she organised rooms.

When she returned, her face was grave.

"Looks like they only have one room left, girls," she said, looking directly at Charlie as she said so. "Fortunately, it has two double beds, but..."

"It's okay, Miss Kathy," he piped up. "I'm happy to sleep in the car."

"Well, I don't know," Kathy began, when the girls chimed in. "Miss Kathy, we *so* can't leave him in the car! It just wouldn't be right. I'm sure he'll behave himself..."

"Like he would even *dare* to try anything," Lucy retorted, and everyone but Chaarlie broke out in guffaws. The idea of him acting in any way lecherous seemed as inconceivable as if they were talking about a three-year old girl.

Grabbing their belongings, they made their way up the stairs and finding the room dumped their stuff into a corner. "no-no," Emma admonished him when he was about to add his bag to the pile. "You're bringing that to the pub. It's important to keep up appearances, you know."

The locals in the pub kept looking over at the little troupe, unable to figure out what exactly was going on with this group of girls and a single petite, delicate boy. They finally gave up and went back to their beers and snags.

The girls decided that 'Sharl' was going to occupy the place of honour: right in the middle of one of the beds. Emma sidled in on his right: she was a cowgirl with prominent attributes, both bustline and bottom.
        
She nestled her bottom against his side: he was going absolutely no-where on that side of the bed. Lucy and Chloe climbed in on the other side. Lucy grinned at him lying rigid on his back in his boxers.
        
"Relax, pumpkin, we won't bite," she cooed. "At least, not hard."

Chloe giggled. "Oh, you are *forever* biting me, you goose," she said, punching Lucy playfully.

The girls slept soundly, while Charlie hardly slept at all.

The next morning, they started off very early on what turned out to be a twelve-hour day to Eucla. The mood of the girls had deteriorated somewhat, so to relieve boredom, Kathy proposes the girls think of things they wanted to undertake one they got to Thornton. 

"Alright, ladies, let's do something to pass the time. How about we each share what we’re most excited to do once we get to Thornton? It’ll help make the trip feel shorter."

"Oh my gosh, yes!" Emma exclaimed. "I can't wait to try on all the costumes. I’ve always wanted to wear those extravagant dresses from the 1780s. I hope they have ones with those big hoop skirts and fancy hats!"

"Same here!" Chloe chimed in. "And I heard they have this amazing wig collection. Can you imagine wearing those huge powdered wigs? It’ll be like we’re in a historical drama or something!"

"I’m very curious about the clients," Lucy said thoughtfully. "Kathy, who are they, exactly? Like, are they all history buffs or just people looking for a unique experience?"

"Most of our clients are indeed history enthusiasts," Kathy replied, "but we also get a fair share of tourists who are just looking for a unique, immersive experience. It’s a mixed bag, really. The clients love interacting with us in our roles, and it’s a lot of fun to see their reactions."

Sarah had been studying the maps app on her phone the night before. "Why is Thornton so far away from everything?"

"Thornton is pretty remote because it adds to the authenticity of the experience. The idea is to transport clients back in time." Kathy looked into her rear view mirror. Charlie was fast asleep. She felt emboldened to say more than she would have had he been awake. "Having it away from modern distractions helps with that. Plus, the landscape is beautiful and untouched, which makes it feel like a real step back in time. By the way," she added with a wry smile, "I truly think who is going to be taking a totally crazy step in his experience is Charlie. What you girls were saying in jest yesterday is actually part of the master plan, but sshhh, don't mention it to him. It's our little secret."

"You mean, what we were saying about getting him all girlied up and everything?" Sarah asked hopefully.

"Exactly. It's crucial that his particular role include dressing in the opposite sex, as we want to encourage exploring in that domain, you understand."

"That makes sense, I guess," Jessica murmured, so as not to wake up Charlie. "But where’s the nearest large town?" she asked in a louder voice. "Just in case we need to, like, get supplies or something."

"The nearest large town is Bathurst. It’s about an hour’s drive from Thornton. We make supply runs there regularly, so we’re never really cut off from the modern world."

"Right, then, but back to the fun stuff!" Emma proclaimed. "I am like so *super* excited about the dances. Do they teach us the proper dances from the 1780s? I want to learn all those fancy steps and twirls."

Kathy smiled. This was a great group, these girls! "Absolutely! We have dance instructors who specialize in historical dances. You’ll get to learn everything from minuets to country dances. It’s a lot of fun and a great way to stay in character."

"What about the food?" Chloe asked quietly. She was a bit of an epicurean. "Do we get to eat like they did back then? I’m curious about what kind of meals they had."

"Oh, we stay as authentic as possible, especially with the food. As you might have guessed, food was a lot simpler back then, particularly for the commoners. You will be eating a lot of very traditional, very simple, very *healthy* dishes. No Maccas for some time to come." She waited for a groan: there was none. "It’s quite an experience to taste what people ate over two hundred years ago."

"I can’t wait to get started!" Emma gushed. "This is going to be such an adventure. I’m already thinking of all the stories I’ll have to tell my friends back home."

"Me too!" Sarah squeezed Emma's arm. "This is like living in a different world, Emma. I’m so excited to see how everything worked back then, and to learn to be a part of it."

"Thanks for this info, Kathy," Jessica said happily. "It’s making me even more excited. I can’t believe we’re actually doing this!"

Kathy beamed. "I’m glad to hear it! Just wait until you see Foire up close and personal... you will fall in love with it.. Talk about an unforgettable experience for everyone!"

"Even Sharl, here?" He hadn't budged. Emma poked him but he merely grunted slightly and continued sleeping. "Okay, okay, let’s keep going! Who else has something they’re excited about? We still have a lot of road ahead of us!"



![Celeste](https://www.tightbytes.com/art/images/CelestePD/PD-Celeste16.jpg){: align=left width=450 }



It was a very tired troupe that finally pulled in through the chateau's gates and came to a stop at the door. It was an overcast evening and somewhat cool. The girls silently got out of the combivan and stared rather in dismay at the ancient-looking building. It was clear this was not what they had imagined at all.

"Where is, um, the fair, Miss Kathy?" Emma finally ventured to ask.

Kathy's smile broadened. She had expected their misgivings and was prepared to take the challenge of re-igniting their enthusiasm.

"Welcome to the eighteenth century!" she proclaimed grandly. She smiled knowingly. "Not what you expected, is it?" There was a bit of head-shaking: the troupe seemed to be shrinking into itself.

"You see, first of all, it took a *lot* of very careful design and study to build a proper chateau that will look, feel, smell and everything else like something from the eighteenth century," she began, when she spied young Charlie gaping in amazement at the roof. "Yes, Charlie?"

"You've got that roof absolutely perfect," he muttered, clearly in awe. "And those windows! And that door!" He ran towards the door. "Oh, Miss Kathy, I can't *wait* to see the inside!"

The girls stared at him as if he'd taken leave of his senses. He was evidently *impressed* with this... this? A pile of rubble? They looked quizzically at each other. Miss Kathy spoke again.

"I can fully appreciate your confusion, girls, but on this occasion I'd have to say Charlie seems to understand something you might not. If you recall what I told you in the car, we're very focused on authenticity. As in: *extremely* focused!"

The girls still had misgivings, so she continued: "We're not creating a Disneyland, here. Our clients expect a unique, realistic experience, not rides and fairy-floss. They are never disappointed:: we have a three-year waiting list of people who wish to come stay with us. We actually had to limit the stays to a fortnight except for special occasions. *And*," she added dramatically, "we are in the final stages of purchasing an actual chateau in France, where we will be providing the same sort of experience, with perhaps a somewhat heightened sense of realism, given that it will be in France instead of Australia."
        
Bewilderment turned to wonderment as the girls followed her to the front door. Kathy chuckled as she spied Charlie running around the yard, babbling to himself about seventeenth century architecture, touching the stone walls, peering along the ledges, running through the courtyard... clearly excited about everything.
        
He finally met the group at the door, breathless from his exertions.

"How?" He barely managed the single syllable.

Kathy smiled at him as if she was seeing him for the first time.

"You will find out in due course, Charlie," she said kindly. "Now girls, shall we go inside? You too, Charlie. I believe your education is about to begin. I apologise that it should take place after such a hard trip, but... there it is."

The girls trouped in, quiet and subdued. Kathy knew exactly how to raise their spirits. "Shall we show you your rooms?"

It worked. The rooms were exquisitely appointed in an a roccoco lavishness of femininity. Whilst most of the interior of the chateau had the same austere appearance as did the outside, the bedrooms were in delightful contrast to the rest of the chateau. 

Where once were stark and unadorned chambers, the girls' rooms had blossomed into exquisite havens of femininity. The walls, once a somber grey, had been swathed in a delicate, blush-pink wallpaper adorned with intricate patterns of blooming roses and trailing ivy, evoking the romantic allure of a secret garden. Silken draperies in soft pastels cascaded elegantly from the tall windows, their gentle folds catching the light and casting a warm, rosy glow throughout the space.

In each room, the austere furnishings had been replaced with pieces that exuded elegance and subtle opulence. A sumptuous chaise-lounge, upholstered in plush velvet the color of ripe peaches, beckoned invitingly from one corner, adorned with an array of delicately embroidered cushions in shades of lavender, cream, and gold. Nearby, a dainty writing desk, crafted from gleaming mahogany and inlaid with mother-of-pearl, stood ready to capture the whispered musings of its occupant.

The centre of the rooms boasted a chandelier of sparkling crystal drops which hung like a cascade of dewdrops caught in the morning sun, casting a myriad of prismatic reflections that danced upon the walls and ceiling. Beneath it, a delicate tea table set with fine bone china in a pattern of violets and forget-me-nots invited leisurely afternoons spent in the company of cherished friends.

The transformation extended to the smallest details, each chosen with care and an eye for refinement. Gossamer lace doilies adorned every surface, while delicate porcelain figurines of ballerinas and fairies perched daintily upon the mantelpiece. A vase of freshly cut peonies, their petals a riot of pink and white, filled the air with their intoxicating fragrance, adding a final, fragrant touch to the room's metamorphosis.

The rooms had been reborn as sanctuaries of femininity and grace, every element harmonizing to create an atmosphere of serene beauty and tasteful luxury. It was a space where the soul could find respite, enveloped in the tender embrace of its elegant transformation.

There was much ooh-ing and ahh-ing as the girls inspected the rooms, their collective spirits soaring. Miss Kathy watched them bemusedly from the corridors, a benevolent smile playing on her face. Finally, she turned to Charlie, who was watching the girl's elated adulation with an almost expressionless face.

"Don't worry, Sharl, I've got something truly special in store for you. Your education starts tonight!" She had misread his deadpan face as disdain.

She turned back to the girls. "Right then, anyone hungry?"

Reminding them not to expect Macca's, she led them to the kitchen, where a merry fire burnt in the hearth. Pauline, the servant girl, was dressed in her usual dress, an eighteenth century servant-girl dress, complete with shift, stays, apron and cap. She wordlessly served the girls, filling their plates with a wholesome vegetable soup, and pouring their wine for them. The girls admired her attire briefly but as they were famished, they quickly focused their attention to supper.

Soup. Bread. Cheese. And wine. Yes, wine... not the usual fare for non-royalty, but Fleur de Lys was a vintner, so the bottle could proudly claim "Mis En Bouteille au Chateau" (bottled at the chateau).

The girls ate heartily: as unaccustomed as they were to the food, hunger removed all misgivings about taste or texture. Laughter and happy chatter returned.

The adventure had begun.
