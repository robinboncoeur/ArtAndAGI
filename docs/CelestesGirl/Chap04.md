## Wardrobe, First Assignment

Wardrobe is where romance goes to die.

People imagine velvet and ribbons. They imagine a girl turning prettily in front of a mirror while someone murmurs, *perfect.* They imagine lace like it grew on the body.

What it is, in practice, is triage.

It’s a room full of fabric with histories: sweat that won’t come out, seams that have carried too much weight, tiny tears where someone laughed too hard, buttons missing like teeth. It’s the mild panic of knowing the public will be here soon to pay money for an illusion—and the illusion must not fail in front of them.

Charlie stepped in as if the air changed at the threshold. His gaze moved, careful and wide, taking in rails of garments, labelled drawers, the old wooden mannequins that stood like pale witnesses. He kept his hands half-lifted, unsure what to do with them. Not because he was fascinated. Because he was trying not to do harm.

That pleased me.

“Shut the door,” I said, because doors are boundaries and boundaries matter.

He did it quietly.

The room settled into its own sound: the soft clink of hangers, the faint hum of a fan, the distant bass of the yard outside where Maintenance still shouted at weight and weather.

Charlie’s eyes snagged on a row of women’s garments—stays hanging like ribcages, petticoats folded in neat stacks, chemises white as paper. I watched him look, then look away, as if he didn’t have the right. As if he might be accused simply for noticing.

That, too, was information.

I set my clipboard on the central table and turned to him.

“Right,” I said. “Rule one you’ve already heard: if you touch a garment, you touch it like it’s alive.”

He nodded once, solemn.

“Rule two,” I continued, “is that wardrobe is not a confessional. You don’t tell me your life story, you don’t tell me your feelings, and you do *not* apologise at me like it’s your job.”

His mouth opened reflexively—*sorry* living behind his teeth—and I lifted a hand.

“No,” I said, without heat. “Not here.”

He closed his mouth, eyes flicking down, as if he’d been caught doing something rude.

Good. He could learn.

I crossed to the sink in the corner, turned the tap, and let the water run until it warmed. “Wash your hands.”

He blinked. “Now?”

“Now,” I said. “And properly.”

He moved toward the sink, still cautious, and rolled up his sleeves without being told. That, at least, was promising—an instinct for prep. He lathered the soap, fingers interlacing, nails scrubbed against palm. His hands were long and fine-boned, not labour hands. Hands made for detail.

He rinsed, dried carefully on a towel I’d hung there specifically for this purpose.

When he turned back, he held his hands out for a second, as if he expected me to inspect them.

I did. Not theatrically. Just a glance. Clean.

“Good,” I said.

The word landed on him like a small weight. He straightened a fraction, as if praise were something he didn’t want to drop.

I gestured to the shelves. “Those drawers are labelled. Don’t improvise. Don’t ‘probably.’ Don’t guess. If you don’t know, you ask once—clearly—and then you do what I say.”

His eyes widened a little at *ask once.* “Just once?”

“If you ask me the same question twice,” I said, “it means you weren’t listening the first time. And that’s dangerous here.”

He nodded again, more quickly.

I opened my clipboard. “We’re starting you on men’s wardrobe. Shirts, waistcoats, boots. Durable things. Public things.”

Charlie’s gaze flicked back toward the women’s rail and then away again, almost guiltily, as if relieved that I’d named a safe category.

I didn’t comment. Strategists don’t waste moves.

I walked to the far rack and pulled down a footman’s blouse-shirt: white linen, soft from use, collar still stiff enough to hold a line. A tear the size of a fingernail near the cuff. Easy, if you knew what you were doing. Catastrophic, if you didn’t—because the cuff is what guests see when the boy lifts a tray.

I held it out.

Charlie approached as if the shirt might bruise.

He didn’t grab. He took it with both hands, supporting the fabric rather than pinching it. His touch was… respectful. Not reverent in a religious way, not precious—just careful, as if the object had a purpose beyond being cloth.

That was the basso continuo, right there, without him knowing it.

“This needs a cuff repair,” I said. “Small stitch. Tight. Invisible.”

He looked down at it, eyes narrowing in concentration. “I… I can do that?”

“You can learn,” I corrected. “Show me how you hold a needle.”

He hesitated, then glanced around for a sewing kit as if it might leap into his hands. He looked absurdly lost for a second—like someone asked to fly.

I reached into the drawer and placed a needle and thread on the table. I did it slowly, deliberately, so he could watch my hands.

“Sit,” I said.

He sat.

I didn’t hover behind him like a teacher. I sat opposite, elbows on the table, the way you sit when you’re negotiating rather than instructing.

He picked up the needle like it was a fragile instrument. He threaded it after two tries, lips pressed in concentration. No showmanship, no jokes, no complaint. He simply persisted.

That persistence—quiet, humourless—was something most people mistook for weakness.

They were wrong.

“Alright,” I said. “Do one stitch.”

He brought the needle to the fabric, paused. His hands trembled slightly. Not from fear of me. From fear of doing harm.

“I’m not… good at this,” he said, voice barely above a whisper.

I didn’t answer the insecurity. I answered the reality.

“Then you’ll do it slowly,” I said. “Slow and correct beats fast and ruined.”

His shoulders lowered a fraction, as if that permission to be careful unclenched him.

He made the first stitch. It wasn’t perfect. But it was neat. The thread lay where it should. The fabric didn’t pucker.

I watched his face as he worked—how the tension in it shifted from shame to focus. Focus was a safer home for him than confidence.

While he stitched, I moved around the room, doing what I always did: scanning, counting, anticipating.

Two waistcoats missing from rack C. One pair of stockings unpaired. A bodice with a loose eyelet. A smear of something suspicious on a petticoat hem. The kind of details the public never sees and yet always feels when they’re wrong.

A woman leaned into the doorway then, hair in a messy bun, pencil stuck behind one ear. Mara. She’d been here three seasons and treated her knowledge like personal property.

Her eyes flicked to Charlie, then to me. “Who’s that?”

“Mine,” I said, without looking up from the list.

Mara’s mouth tightened. “Wardrobe’s not a daycare, Celeste.”

“It’s not,” I replied, still calm. “That’s why I removed him from Maintenance before he injured himself.”

Mara snorted. “Maintenance isn’t exactly gentle, is it.”

“No,” I said. “And neither am I.”

Her gaze sharpened at that, measuring. She didn’t like my tone, which meant it was the right tone.

“What does he do?” she asked, as if Charlie weren’t in the room.

Charlie’s hands paused over the cuff, needle suspended.

I glanced at him once. He’d gone still again. The old instinct: become invisible when people discuss you.

I decided against letting it happen.

“He hears instructions,” I said. “He handles fabric properly. And he doesn’t treat the room like a joke.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed, but she didn’t argue with that. Instead she leaned on the doorframe, arms folded. “What’s the catch?”

“The catch,” I said pleasantly, “is that I’m short-staffed, not stupid.”

Mara huffed a laugh through her nose, then nodded toward Charlie. “If he ruins that shirt—”

“He won’t,” I said.

Charlie’s needle moved again, small and determined. It was the right kind of pressure: being seen without being mocked.

Mara drifted away, still unconvinced but no longer obstructing. She respected results. Most people did, if you forced them.

I returned to the table and placed a pair of boots beside Charlie’s elbow. Coachman’s boots. Thick leather. Mud-caked. One heel beginning to separate where the glue had started to fail.

Charlie glanced at them, startled—like I’d placed a dead animal on the table.

“These,” I said, “need cleaning and polishing. And this heel needs attention. You’ll bring them back looking like they’ve never known the yard.”

His brow furrowed. “How?”

I let the silence stretch long enough for him to feel the shape of the problem. Then I opened another drawer and laid out supplies: brush, cloth, polish, glue, a small clamp.

“You’ll work it out,” I said. “If you need one instruction, you ask it once.”

He swallowed. “Okay.”

It wasn’t confidence. It was compliance with a spine.

Good.

As he finished the cuff repair, he didn’t smooth the fabric with a careless palm. He pressed it gently, flattening the seam like he was calming something living. Then he held it up and looked at it critically, turning it as though the light itself might reveal his errors.

He wasn’t trying to impress me.

He was trying to be correct.

That difference matters.

“You’re frowning,” I observed.

“I… I can still see it,” he admitted, pointing to the tiniest irregularity in the stitch line.

“You can see it because you’re the one who did it,” I said. “The public will not. What they’ll see is a cuff that doesn’t unravel when a tray tilts.”

He blinked at that framing, as if no one had ever taught him that “good” was sometimes practical rather than perfect.

Then, because I wanted to anchor the basso continuo now—early, cleanly—I said, “Listen.”

He lifted his eyes to me, immediate.

“This room isn’t about clothes,” I said. “It’s about bodies. Clothes are what the world allows bodies to be.”

His face went blank in the way it did when something too large brushed past him. Not offended. Not excited. Just… trying to understand.

I continued, because the message mattered.

“If you handle garments with disrespect, you’re disrespecting the person who has to wear them,” I said. “Not in some abstract moral way. In a physical way. Because a seam that scratches, a stocking that slips, a boot that pinches—those things become someone’s whole day.”

Charlie’s gaze dropped to the shirt in his hands, and I watched the idea settle into him with a kind of relief.

Not fascination.

Purpose.

“I understand,” he said quietly.

“I think you do,” I replied. “Which is why you’re here.”

He swallowed. “Thank you.”

His reflex wanted to add *sorry* again, to apologise for existing in my space, for taking my time, for being a problem.

I lifted my eyebrows.

He caught himself mid-breath and corrected, carefully: “I mean… okay.”

I almost smiled.

Almost.

“Good,” I said instead, because *good* is cleaner than affection when you’re building a system.

I stood, took the repaired shirt from him, and inspected it with the same seriousness I’d give a wound dressing. The stitch was neat. The tear was gone. The cuff lay flat.

I nodded once.

That was all the reward he needed. His shoulders loosened like a knot being untied.

I placed the shirt on the “Ready” rail and turned back to him.

“Now,” I said, “boots.”

He looked at the muddy leather, then at the brush, then at me—puzzled, still. As if he couldn’t quite believe that this, too, was a kind of permission.

“You’re… sure?” he asked.

“Yes,” I said. “And Charlie—”

He stilled at his name.

I made my voice brisk, to keep it from feeling like an embrace. “If you ruin something, you tell me immediately. You don’t hide it. You don’t cry over it. You don’t try to fix it in secret.”

He flinched slightly at *cry*—not because I’d accused him, but because it hit close to a fear.

“You tell me,” I repeated. “Truth is always cheaper than damage.”

He nodded. “Truth,” he echoed, as if committing it to memory.

“That’s right,” I said. “You’ll learn our values quickly.”

*Our.*

The word was a small claim, slipped in like thread through fabric. Not ownership. Not yet.

Membership.

He didn’t react outwardly, but I saw the way it struck him—the way the room became, for him, less like a strange country and more like a shelter with rules.

He picked up the brush and began on the boots with slow, methodical strokes. Mud flaked away. Leather emerged. His hands moved with the same careful respect he’d used on the shirt, as if he were uncovering something rather than merely cleaning it.

And the strangest thing was: he looked calmer.

Not happy. Not free. But calmer—because the work made sense. Because the rules were clear. Because I was here, and my presence had a shape he could lean against without falling.

I watched him for a moment longer than necessary.

He felt it and glanced up, startled, like a bird sensing a shadow.

“Yes?” he asked, immediate—waiting for instruction.

I let my gaze hold him, steady and unreadable.

“No,” I said. “Nothing. Carry on.”

He looked down again, and the brush kept moving.

That was the start of it: not obedience, not romance, not salvation.

Just a boy doing careful work in a room where carefulness was finally useful—and a girl quietly measuring exactly how much trust he could carry before he noticed he was carrying it.

---

If you’d like, the next scene can be **the first deliberate “trust test”**: Celeste sends Charlie out of Wardrobe on an errand that requires him to speak one sentence to a higher-status adult (or a performer), and she watches whether he collapses into apologising or holds the line with her wording. That’s where the arc begins to bite.

By midmorning, Wardrobe had turned from a room into a machine.

People drifted in and out in half-dressed waves: a footman needing his cuffs re-starched, a girl with a loose cap ribbon, Mara complaining about missing pins as if pins were a personal affront. I answered without urgency, because urgency is contagious and I refused to spread it.

Charlie stayed where I put him, brush moving in steady strokes over the coachman’s boots. Mud came off in obedient flakes. Leather emerged. His shoulders were no longer up around his ears.

Good.

He’d needed a task with rules. He’d needed a way to be useful without being tested on confidence.

Which was, unfortunately, the next thing he needed.

I watched him without making it obvious. He glanced up once, startled, and I let my face remain neutral.

No reward for checking in. He had to learn to work without constantly seeking permission.

When the boots finally shone and the heel sat clamped in place like a problem that had agreed to behave, I reached for them and set them on the Ready rail.

“Nice,” I said. One syllable. Enough.

His throat moved. He nodded. He looked pleased in a way that was almost painful to witness—like someone who’d been starving and had forgotten what bread felt like.

I turned back to my clipboard. “Charlie.”

He straightened instantly. Too instantly.

“Yes?”

“There’s a missing waistcoat,” I said, flicking my pen to the inventory list. “Black. Brass buttons. Size medium. It should be on rack C with the footmen’s set.”

He frowned as if picturing the rack. “I didn’t see—”

“I know,” I said. “That’s why we’re fixing it.”

He waited, hands hovering. Always ready to be told what reality was.

I picked up a note card and wrote quickly. *Wardrobe requires waistcoat — black, brass buttons — for Footman 3. Signed: C. Shelley (Wardrobe).* Then I slid it across the table.

“Take this to Graham.”

His eyes widened. “Maintenance Graham?”

“Yes.”

He didn’t move.

The old reflex rose in him like a tide. I could almost see it: *He’ll be angry. I’ll get in trouble. I’ll say sorry. I’ll make it worse.*

This wasn’t cruelty. This was calibration.

Because if Charlie was going to work with me, he couldn’t be a ghost. He had to be able to carry my words into other rooms.

I leaned slightly forward. “Listen.”

He looked at me, immediate.

“You are not going to him as a nuisance,” I said. “You are going to him as my runner. You are carrying a request from Wardrobe. That is normal. That is allowed.”

His lips parted.

“And,” I added, “you are not going to apologise. Not once.”

He swallowed. “What if he—”

I lifted my eyebrows.

He caught himself. “Okay.”

“Good,” I said. “You’ll say exactly this.” I tapped the note card with my pen. “*Graham, Celeste needs the black waistcoat for Footman Three. Have you seen it, or should we pull a spare?*”

He repeated it silently, eyes tracking my mouth as if words were physical objects he could hold.

“Again,” I said.

He repeated it, slightly more steady.

“Again,” I said.

His jaw tightened. He said it a third time, clearer. Almost firm.

There was the line. There was the spine.

I nodded once. “Excellent. Now—go.”

He stood, then hesitated, hovering on the edge of motion like a bird at the edge of flight.

“Charlie,” I said, gently, because the gentleness mattered *precisely because* I didn’t use it often. “Look at me.”

He looked.

“Match my pace,” I said. “In your head. Walk like you’re doing a job.”

He blinked, as if walking could be reframed.

Then he nodded, turned, and left.

I watched him go. Not with sentiment. With attention.

This was the first test: could he carry a simple sentence into a room full of men and tools without collapsing into apology?

I returned to the table and began sorting lace trims, because you don’t announce that you’re waiting for a result. You behave as though the outcome is inevitable.

Mara wandered in again, eyeing the open door. “Where’s your boy gone?”

I didn’t look up. “Errand.”

Mara made a sound between amusement and disdain. “You’re brave.”

“I’m correct,” I said.

A few minutes passed. Five, perhaps. Long enough for the mind to invent catastrophes.

I pictured Charlie in the yard, shoulders hunched, saying *sorry* before he even spoke, Graham’s patience snapping. I pictured Charlie shrinking back into himself and deciding he didn’t belong anywhere.

Then I heard footsteps—too light, too careful—returning.

Charlie appeared in the doorway, cheeks flushed, eyes bright with the strange feverish sheen of someone who has just survived something they’d been certain would kill them.

He held the waistcoat in both hands as if it were a fragile animal.

Behind him, Graham’s voice carried down the corridor. “Tell her it was in the prop crate like I bloody said. And tell her to label her racks properly.”

Charlie flinched at the shouted words, but he didn’t crumple. He walked in, shut the door softly, and approached the table.

He set the waistcoat down with reverence.

I inspected it quickly: correct garment, correct buttons, faint smell of dust. It would do.

I looked up at him.

He was waiting—tense, braced—like he expected punishment for existing.

“Well?” I said, mildly.

He blinked. “I… I said the sentence.”

“Did you?” I asked, as if it were a genuine question, not an invitation to confess.

He nodded, then swallowed. “I said it exactly. He… stared at me.”

“And you did what?” I prompted.

Charlie’s throat bobbed. “I… looked back.”

That was the moment.

Not the waistcoat. Not the errand. The looking back.

He didn’t even realise he’d done it. He said it like a fact, not a victory. But I heard the victory anyway.

“And did you apologise?” I asked.

He hesitated. His mouth opened—habit reaching for the old word—

Then he stopped himself, eyes widening, as if he’d just caught his own hand reaching toward a hot stove.

“No,” he said, softly. “I didn’t.”

I let my expression remain calm, because if I rewarded him too warmly he’d begin performing for warmth. I wanted him performing for competence.

“Good,” I said. “That is what you do now.”

His shoulders loosened slightly, as if someone had undone a strap that was cutting into him.

Mara, who had been hovering by the shelves pretending not to listen, gave a reluctant snort. “He actually did it?”

I didn’t glance at her. “Of course he did.”

Charlie’s eyes flicked toward Mara, uncertainty spiking again—social danger.

I cut it off.

“Charlie,” I said, turning back to him. “You’re not here to be liked. You’re here to be useful.”

His face flushed. He nodded. “Okay.”

“And,” I added, because this part mattered, “you’re not here to be humiliated either. If anyone tries it, you tell me.”

He looked at me quickly—startled, almost disbelieving. “You… want me to tell you?”

“Yes,” I said, as if it were obvious. “That’s part of the job.”

His gaze held mine for a beat too long. That struck quality again—relief with teeth in it.

I broke eye contact first, because I could feel the hook setting and I didn’t intend to let it set too quickly.

I turned to the waistcoat, lifted it, and hung it on the Ready rail.

Then I slid another item across the table: a bundle of linen ties.

“Next,” I said, briskly. “Sort these. Count them. Tell me exactly how many. And if you don’t know, you ask once.”

Charlie took the bundle with both hands.

He didn’t smile.

But he stood a little straighter.

And somewhere in the quiet machinery of his mind, I could feel it clicking into place: when I gave him words, he could walk through rooms he’d been afraid of.

That was trust.

Not blind.

Not yet.

But alive enough to test again.
