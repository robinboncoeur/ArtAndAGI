# Scene 17 

Absolutely — it’s still *squarely* on the cards, and Scene 17 is the perfect on-ramp for it. In fact, the rung-training + ledger culture is what makes the later MBA/ops arc feel inevitable rather than “plotted”: Celeste is already being shaped by a room that treats structure as love language.

Below is **Scene 17**, fully scanned for POV wobble and micro-nits, with:

* **No third-person “Celeste”** references (clean “I” throughout).
* A few tiny cadence tweaks (no meaning changes).
* The “business” seed kept *subtle*—a flicker, not a speech.

# Scene 17 — “Second Rung” (Celeste POV)

Mara didn’t announce the second rung like it was a milestone.

She treated it like a seam finish.

“Today,” she said, “someone speaks to you while you work. You keep your hands.”

Charlie’s eyes moved to the ledger as if the page might tell him what that meant in muscle terms. His shoulders lifted a fraction.

Mara tapped the table once.

“No shoulders.”

He dropped them, a little too fast, like a boy caught doing something wrong. Mara didn’t correct the speed. She corrected the premise.

“Not wrong,” she said. “Just unnecessary.”

The mock-up from yesterday lay folded at the end of the cutting table — no longer the centre of attention, which was its own kind of relief. Today’s work was smaller and meaner in its simplicity: chalk lines, notch marks, grainline checks. Things you could do perfectly until a voice arrived and reminded you you were a person being witnessed.

Mara looked at Sarah.

“You wanted front-facing,” Mara said. “You’re the voice.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened. “Me.”

“Yes,” Mara replied, already moving on. “Not as punishment. As training. Speak like a colleague.”

Sarah tipped her chin, as if she’d never been asked to do anything in her life except tolerate it.

“Fine.”

Lauren set her tote down and pulled out a packet of labels, the kind used for tagging bolts and marking stock. Practical. Domestic. Quietly competent. She didn’t insert herself into Mara’s authority. She simply made herself useful in a way that softened the air without changing the rules.

Charlie stood at the cutting table with chalk in hand, pattern pinned, his attention narrowed to the line. He had learned, in three days, that the safest place for him was inside a task.

Mara’s finger hovered over the pattern piece.

“Waistline. Then the hip spring marks. Clean.”

Charlie nodded and began.

The chalk whispered. The line appeared.

It was ordinary. It was safe.

Sarah leaned against a shelf, arms folded.

“You look like you’re defusing a bomb,” she said.

Charlie’s chalk hesitated. A white stutter on the line.

Mara’s voice landed without volume.

“Colleague,” she reminded.

Sarah rolled her eyes. “Fine. You’re *working* like you’re defusing a bomb.”

Charlie’s fingers tightened. He tried to move the chalk again and the line wobbled — only a millimetre, but enough that he saw it. His breath sharpened as if the room had narrowed.

Lauren stepped closer. Not to rescue. Not to crowd. Her voice stayed low, meant for Charlie, not the room.

“Short answers,” she said. “Factual ones. Then back to the line.”

Charlie blinked at her.

Lauren’s expression was warm but firm, like a coach who refuses drama because she respects the athlete.

“You don’t have to be clever,” she added. “You just have to stay in the work.”

Mara didn’t look at either of them, which was how she approved things: by not interrupting them.

Sarah pushed off the shelf.

“All right,” she said, and this time her tone shifted. Less spectator. More shop-floor. “Why are you marking that notch before the grainline?”

Charlie’s chalk paused again — then steadied, as if the question had given him somewhere rational to stand.

“Because the notch is a reference point,” he said, quietly. “The grainline is easier once the reference is anchored.”

He didn’t look up. He didn’t smile. He didn’t apologise for speaking. He answered, then kept drawing.

Lauren’s mouth twitched.

“That,” she murmured, to nobody in particular, “is the whole trick.”

Sarah watched his hand for a beat, her expression changing in small increments: annoyance, then reluctant interest.

“And if you mark it wrong?” she asked.

Charlie’s chalk moved.

“Then we’ll know,” he said. “Because it won’t match the block.”

Sarah’s lips parted as if she was about to make it personal. Mara’s voice cut in—clean, precise.

“Colleague,” Mara said again, as if it were a stitch standard.

Sarah exhaled through her nose.

“Right,” she said. “If it doesn’t match the block, it doesn’t match the block.”

Charlie made the last waistline mark and lifted the chalk. He set it down properly. That tiny act — putting the chalk down instead of clutching it — felt like proof.

Mara stepped in.

“Again,” she said, and slid the next piece toward him. “Same task. Same voice.”

Charlie swallowed. Then nodded.

Sarah circled to the other side of the table, forcing him to exist in a different angle of attention.

“Does it bother you,” she asked, and the edge returned to her tone, “that all this is… seen?”

Charlie’s chalk faltered — one heartbeat — and then he heard Lauren’s instruction again as if it were written on the table:

*Short answers. Factual ones. Back to the line.*

“It used to,” he said. “Now it’s… data.”

Sarah’s brow lifted. “Data.”

Charlie made the next line. “If I can’t do the work while someone talks, I can’t do the work.”

That was the most grown-up thing he’d said in the room.

Mara’s eyes flicked up — once — then down again. A microscopic nod, the closest she ever came to pride.

Sarah’s mouth tightened, and for a moment I saw her deciding what kind of person she wanted to be in this system.

She chose — grudgingly — correct.

“All right,” she said. “Then I’m going to give you something useful.”

Charlie didn’t look up. “Okay.”

Sarah pointed. “Your line is drifting a hair at the side-back.”

Charlie stopped. Looked. Adjusted.

“Thank you,” he said, still not looking at her, because the looking wasn’t the point.

He corrected the drift. Continued.

Lauren let out a breath that was almost laughter—private, pleased.

“See?” she said softly. “Learnable.”

Mara reached for the ledger and wrote while Charlie worked. Not as theatre. As record.

She pushed the book toward him when she was done.

**EXPOSURE TRAINING — rung two completed:** spoken to while working; hands maintained; responses factual; no retreat.

Charlie stared at the sentence as if it had weight.

Then — without being prompted — he added his own note beneath it, smaller, neater:

**NOTES:** first question shook me. second question steadied me. answered and kept moving.

He underlined *kept moving* once.

Sarah glanced at the underline, then at Mara.

“That’s it?” she asked, half-challenging.

Mara didn’t bother looking up.

“That’s it,” she said. “Until it’s boring.”

Lauren slid a label across the table toward me. **STAYS BLOCK — RETURNING-TO-WORK**, it read in tidy print.

“We’re going to need a proper storage system for these,” Lauren said, conversational, warm. “You can’t build a business on paper scraps and hope.”

Mara made a sound that was almost agreement.

“A business,” Charlie repeated under his breath, as if the word had snuck in.

I watched him—just for a second—watch the templates, the ledger, the labels.

There it was: the beginning of a fantasy he didn’t yet have language for. *If it’s a business, someone provides. Someone holds it up.*

But I didn’t look like someone waiting to be held up.

I looked like someone reading a map and deciding where the road would go.

Mara tapped the table once.

“Third rung next,” she said.

Charlie blinked. “What’s third?”

Mara’s voice stayed flat.

“Someone says something stupid,” she replied. “You keep your hands.”

Sarah smiled without warmth.

“Oh,” she said. “I can help with that.”

Lauren’s smile was warmer, and sharper.

“Colleague,” she reminded Sarah, lightly.

Sarah’s smile tightened.

“Colleague,” she echoed.

Charlie picked up his chalk again.

Not bravely.

Just… as if work was what you did next.

## And yes: the business-head / MBA / moving-in-for-logistics arc is still fully alive

We’re approaching it in the clean, believable way we discussed:

* First we seed **“we need systems”** (labels, storage, scheduling, QA logs).
* Then we show Mara’s pressure: more work, bigger contracts, scaling pains.
* Celeste starts speaking in **frameworks** rather than vibes.
* Charlie’s “provider” fantasy starts flickering in the margins.
* Then: **women write the terms** (Lauren as guardrails; Mara as sponsor/beneficiary; Celeste as decider).
  Moving in is framed as **efficiency + cost-sharing**, not romance.

If you want, next I can draft **Scene 18** (Rung Three: “stupid comment” while he keeps his hands) OR jump to **Scene 19** as the first “Numbers” scene where the atelier’s growth becomes undeniable.
