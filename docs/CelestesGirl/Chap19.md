# Scene 19

# Scene 19 — “The Numbers” (Celeste POV)

Mara didn’t call a meeting.

She called me to the cutting table the way she called anyone: with a hand gesture that assumed you’d come, and a tone that didn’t waste time making you feel chosen.

“Bring the ledger,” she said.

Lauren was already there, sleeves rolled, a pencil behind her ear like she’d been born with it. She had a small stack of papers in front of her—printed emails, order confirmations, a delivery docket stamped in red. On top sat a single sheet covered in neat columns, the kind of handwriting that made maths look like it had manners.

Charlie hovered at the edge of the table, not in the old apologetic way. More like a technician waiting for his next specification.

Sarah sat on a stool, arms folded, expression guarded as if she didn’t want to be caught caring.

Mara tapped the stack of papers with two fingers.

“Museum wants another run,” she said. “More sizes. More units.”

Lauren didn’t smile. She rarely did when the stakes went up. She simply slid the top sheet toward Mara.

“And they want delivery dates,” Lauren added. “Not just ‘when it’s ready.’”

Mara’s eyes flicked over the page once. She didn’t read like a person. She read like a machine checking tolerances.

“How many?” she asked.

Lauren didn’t glance at the page. She knew it.

“Thirty-six,” she said. “This batch. With a follow-on option if the first run sells through.”

Sarah let out a low whistle despite herself.

“Thirty-six,” she repeated. “That’s not… boutique.”

“No,” Mara said. “That’s work.”

She looked at me then, and I felt the shift—the moment when a room stops being a room and becomes an organism.

“Open the ledger,” Mara said.

I did.

It fell open to pages that had started to look less like notes and more like proof: neat headings, repeated fields, signatures. Charlie’s handwriting, increasingly steady. Mara’s marginal corrections. The blunt, unwavering language of process.

Mara pointed to the most recent entries.

“How many prototypes did we run last week?”

Charlie answered before I could.

“Eleven,” he said. “Across the three body types. One full redo on the ‘well-nourished’ block. Two seam-finish changes. And… and the underarm guard adjustment.”

He said it like he was reciting something sacred. Facts. Sequence. Outcome.

Mara nodded once. Then she pointed at Lauren’s sheet.

“And how many finished garments left the building?”

Lauren’s pencil tapped the paper. “Nine.”

Charlie blinked. “Only nine?”

Lauren turned her head slightly toward him. Her voice stayed warm, but it didn’t soften the truth.

“Nine finished garments,” she said, “is nine more than most people manage without a system.”

Mara watched Charlie absorb that. She didn’t rescue him from the disappointment. She let it become useful.

“Here’s the problem,” Mara said, and drew a rectangle on the paper with her pencil. A plain box. No drama. “Prototype time competes with production time.”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “So you hire someone.”

Mara’s gaze cut to her.

“With what,” Mara asked, flat, “money?”

Sarah opened her mouth, then shut it again. She hated the way reality closed doors. The difference was, Mara used doors as hinges.

Lauren slid another sheet forward. This one looked uglier—spreadsheets always do when they tell the truth.

“Mara asked me to tally costs,” Lauren said. “Materials. Hardware. Labour. Waste. The things you forget to count when you’re still pretending you’re just making pretty things.”

Mara’s mouth tightened, approving the phrasing without commenting on it.

Lauren continued, calm. “We’re profitable on small runs. We’re *interesting* on larger ones. But only if we stop bleeding time.”

Charlie stared at the sheets as if they were an unfamiliar language.

Mara pointed to him without looking.

“Read the bottom line,” she said.

Charlie flinched. Then leaned in.

“It says…” he swallowed. “It says if we do thirty-six without changing anything, we’ll… we’ll be exhausted.”

Sarah snorted. “Welcome to womanhood.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to her. Not warning this time. Just *enough*.

Sarah held up a hand. “Colleague,” she muttered, as if correcting herself was a chore.

Mara returned to Charlie.

“And if we change something?” Mara asked.

Charlie stared at the numbers. His mind tried to make them into fabric.

Lauren, gently: “Speak like the ledger.”

Charlie swallowed.

“If we reduce prototype cycles,” he said slowly, “and standardise… more of the steps. Templates. Hardware packs. Cutting order.” His eyes lifted, cautious. “Scheduling.”

Mara nodded.

“There,” she said. “That’s the shape of it.”

Then she looked at me.

“Celeste,” Mara said. “You see it.”

It wasn’t a question. It was an assignment.

I did see it. I could feel my mind doing its favourite thing—taking chaos and trying to compress it into something repeatable. I loved the atelier for its craft, but what I loved more—what I almost didn’t dare admit—was the feeling you got when a system snapped into place and suddenly the world behaved.

Lauren watched my face and gave a small, private smile, as if she’d been waiting for me to say it out loud.

“Say it,” Mara said.

I hesitated, then gave it to them straight.

“We need operations,” I said. “Not vibes. Not heroics. Operations.”

Sarah blinked. “Operations.”

“Yes,” I replied. “Inventory. Vendor schedules. Production planning. QA in a way that doesn’t depend on Mara being in three places at once.”

Mara’s eyes stayed on mine. She didn’t smile, but I felt the pressure ease a fraction, as if she’d been carrying something alone and had just heard someone offer to pick up a corner.

Lauren leaned on the table.

“And if we do that,” she said, warm, almost conversational, “we’re not just making garments. We’re building a business.”

Charlie’s throat moved at the word again.

*A business.*

I watched him watching the papers, and I saw the thought trying to form into a picture in his head: money, provision, security. The old script, reaching for purchase.

Mara didn’t look at him. She didn’t need to. She addressed the room.

“Wardrobe is already a business,” Mara said. “The only question is whether we run it, or it runs us.”

Silence settled—clean, not tense.

Lauren broke it, the way she always did: by turning the moment into something you could actually do.

“Okay,” she said, brisk warmth. “Decisions. Do we accept the museum run?”

Mara’s answer was immediate.

“Yes.”

Sarah huffed. “Of course.”

Charlie looked up. “Can we… can we do it?”

Mara’s gaze went to him, steady.

“We can,” she said. “If we stop pretending labour is infinite.”

Then Mara turned to me again.

“You want to go back to school,” she said.

The sentence landed with a peculiar precision—like a pin going through fabric. It wasn’t gossip. It wasn’t a guess. It was something she’d observed and filed away as a constraint, the same way she filed away that a seam was rolling or a tie point was anchoring too much load.

I felt my face heat, irritation rising faster than sentiment.

“Yes,” I said. “Uni. MBA. Or at least the pathway to it.”

Sarah lifted a brow. “You? Business?”

I met her gaze. “Yes.”

Mara didn’t let Sarah’s surprise take oxygen.

Mara looked at the numbers again. Then at me.

“I don’t want a business bro,” Mara said. “I want someone who understands this work and can make it survive growth.”

She tapped the ledger.

“You understand standards,” she said. “You understand policy. And you’re already thinking in systems.”

Lauren’s smile flickered, a quiet *finally.*

Mara continued, blunt.

“But we don’t have the money to send you.”

There it was. The real wall. Not fear. Not doubt. Tuition.

My annoyance sharpened, clean as a blade.

“I can run circles around most people in a classroom,” I said. “I can’t run circles around fees.”

Charlie’s head snapped up. He didn’t speak, but I saw it—the instinctive surge of devotion, the script trying to present itself as solution: *I can fix that. I can provide.*

Lauren saw it too. Her warmth didn’t vanish. It turned into guardrails.

She looked at Mara, not at Charlie.

“Then we do what we do,” Lauren said. “We solve it like adults.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed, attentive.

Lauren tapped the papers.

“We accept the museum run,” she said. “We price it properly. We track time properly. We stop doing invisible labour. And we set up a fund—transparent, written, agreed.”

Sarah sat up. “A fund.”

Lauren nodded. “Education. Operations. Whatever you want to call it. But it doesn’t happen on hints and hope.”

Mara’s gaze stayed on Lauren for a long second.

Then, a single nod.

“Write it,” Mara said.

Lauren’s pencil moved.

Charlie stared at the page as if a future had started appearing in ink.

Mara glanced at him—not unkindly, not indulgently. Just factual.

“And nobody,” Mara said, “gets to mistake money for authority in this room.”

Charlie swallowed. “No.”

Mara didn’t accept promises. She accepted behaviour.

She tapped the ledger once.

“Good,” she said. “Then we proceed.”

Lauren pushed a clean sheet toward me.

“Start with what you want,” she said, voice warm again. “In numbers. Fees. Timeline. Units.”

I picked up the pen.

Not because I needed permission.

Because this was what the atelier did when it wanted something real.

It wrote it down, and made it measurable.

Outside, the faire carried on, loud and theatrical and full of people telling stories about themselves.

Inside, at the cutting table, we began building one that would hold.
