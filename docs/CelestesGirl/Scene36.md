# Scene 36

## Three Months Later — Winter (Celeste POV)

Winter didn’t arrive politely.

It came in sideways—wind off the south that found every gap in every collar, rain that didn’t fall so much as *travel*, and a cold that made even a heated workroom feel provisional.

The Faire kept going anyway.

That was the thing about people who paid for “authenticity”: they loved hardship as long as it happened to them in wool and with a ticket stub in their pocket. They came down south of Melbourne in scarves and optimism, queued in weather that would’ve sent sensible people home, and posed smiling beside timber palings while the wind tried to peel their cheeks off.

Wardrobe scaled around it.

Not with heroics. With systems.

There were two new stitchers on the roster now—names pencilled into the schedule in Mara’s angular hand. A finishing specialist who could hem a skirt so cleanly the line looked *inevitable*. A packing table that was no longer an afterthought but a station with its own checklist and bins and tape measured to the millimetre.

And on the board, pinned under FIELD NOTES, the museum’s feedback had become routine instead of insult.

**NYMPH LINE — v3 (WINTER FABRICS) — FIT / WEAR ISSUE: REPRODUCIBLE**

You didn’t argue with reproducible.

You fixed it.

The “Nymph” line was still the one everyone wanted.

Now they wanted it in better cloth.

The cheap cottons and forgiving linens had been enough for early viability and the Faire’s baseline. But winter changed everything. Clients started asking for the word that always meant trouble: *upgrade*.

Wool blends. Heavier weaves. Better drape. Less mercy.

Mara had looked at the new swatches, looked at the order queue, and said, flatly: “Expensive mistakes are still mistakes. Test everything.”

So fixing, prototyping, and testing recommenced.

And Charli wore the blue gown again—white apron, square neckline, the whole silhouette snapped into place—because that’s what he did now. Not “dress up.” Not “be brave.” Just wear-test. Log. Improve.

He wore it almost all day.

Which meant, in winter, he wore a coat over it to get to the van. He wore gloves between tasks. He drank more tea than any human should drink and still kept his hands steady.

And, quietly, he looked… kept.

Not polished. Not theatrical.

Just maintained in a way he’d never been before.

Celeste noticed it the way she noticed everything: as a shift in baseline.

He smelled clean in a neutral way that didn’t announce itself. His hair was tied in the practical knot she’d taught him months ago, and he no longer panicked at tendrils. He fixed tangles, fixed eyes-blocking strands, and ignored the rest like a four-year-old with better things to do than curate herself.

Sarah had been right about that, and Celeste had quietly made it policy: triage, not obsession.

It should have made Celeste feel satisfied and nothing else.

It did make her feel satisfied.

It also did something worse: it made her increasingly aware, in the most inconvenient moments, that she was attracted to him.

Not in the cheap way. Not as novelty. Not as “isn’t this interesting.”

In the way you became attracted to someone who accepted your standards without resentment—who met you halfway and then kept walking.

Charli had stopped trying to be worthy by providing.

Now he was being worthy by maintaining.

And it was… devastating.

Winter sharpened everything. The work. The ethics. The small rituals of care that became survival.

By the time they got home that night, the house felt like shelter in the most literal sense. Celeste shut the door against the wind and stood for a second with her forehead resting against the timber, listening to the silence settle.

Charli moved past her without fanfare and turned on the heater. Kettle. Tea.

Infrastructure.

Celeste took off her coat, hung it properly—because the house had standards too now—and went straight to her desk.

Study hours were non-negotiable.

That had been the deal from the beginning, written into their life the way Mara wrote terms into contracts: not cruel, just real.

Charli didn’t sulk about it. He didn’t hover.

He made the world hold around it.

A mug of tea appeared on the corner of her desk without interrupting her. A plate with something warm. The lamp angled so it didn’t glare off the page.

Celeste studied until her brain went grainy, until the words on the screen stopped meaning anything and became shapes. She closed her laptop with the same careful finality she used to close a ledger.

“That’s me,” she said aloud. “Done.”

Charli looked up from the kitchen bench where he’d been folding something—laundry, probably, because of course it was laundry. He didn’t say *finally*. He didn’t say *about time*. He only nodded as if she’d completed a task that mattered, because she had.

“Okay,” he said. “You want tea?”

“I already have tea.”

He smiled, small. “More tea.”

Celeste felt something soften in her chest. She stood, stretched, and walked toward the bathroom to wash her face—routine, maintenance, the simple acts that meant you were still a person and not just a brain on a schedule.

The bathroom was warmer than the rest of the house. The mirror fogged slightly as the tap ran. Celeste clipped her hair back and reached into the cabinet for her cleanser.

Her fingers brushed something that wasn’t hers.

A small, hard bottle tucked behind the neatly lined things—behind her own plain pump bottle, behind the floss, behind the spare toothpaste.

Celeste froze.

Not because of paranoia. Because of pattern recognition.

Charli didn’t hide things in her house. Charli’s entire personality was built on being legible. If something was hidden, it meant he believed it had to be hidden.

She pulled the bottle out.

White plastic. Childproof cap. No brand she recognised. The label—partially peeled, as if someone had tried to make it anonymous and failed.

And inside: capsules.

Celeste stared at them for a beat too long.

Her mind went quiet, the way it did when something crossed from “odd” into “dangerous.”

She didn’t panic.

She did what she always did.

She assessed.

**Is this prescribed?**
The label was damaged. No clear name. No clear instructions visible. That alone was a red flag.

**Is this harmless?**
People didn’t hide harmless things.

**Does this belong in my house without my knowledge?**
No.

Celeste screwed the cap back on with steady hands.

She didn’t storm down the hallway.

She didn’t shout his name.

She walked back to the kitchen like a person carrying a fact.

Charli was at the bench, wiping a spill. He looked up when she entered—calm, domestic, safe.

Then he saw the bottle in her hand.

His face went still in a way Celeste had only seen once before: the expression of someone caught in a private emergency.

“Celeste,” he said, and it wasn’t a question. It was a warning. It was *please*.

Celeste set the bottle on the bench between them with controlled precision. Not a slam. Not a flourish. An exhibit.

“What is this?” she asked.

Charli’s throat moved. He didn’t reach for it. He didn’t lie. He just stood there as if his body had decided it wasn’t allowed to move.

“It’s… nothing,” he said, reflexively.

Celeste’s gaze sharpened.

“Don’t,” she said, quiet and lethal. “Not in my house.”

Charli flinched, just slightly.

Celeste kept her voice level. She refused to raise it, because raised voices were a loss of control, and she refused to give control away here.

“What is it?” she repeated. “And who gave it to you?”

Charli’s mouth opened. Closed.

Then, very softly, he said, “It’s to stop… things.”

Celeste felt her stomach drop.

“Things,” she echoed.

Charli looked away, as if the kitchen wall might be kinder than her eyes. “My body,” he said. “It’s… changing.”

Celeste held very still.

Winter. Wind. Faire. The new fabrics. The clients. The way he’d begun to look more maintained.

And beneath it, a private terror she hadn’t seen because he’d been so good at being functional.

Celeste’s voice softened by a fraction—not indulgent, just human.

“What changes?” she asked.

Charli swallowed. “The… male stuff,” he said, and the words came out like poison. “The way it… tries to happen.”

His eyes flicked to her then, desperate and ashamed at once.

“I don’t want it,” he said. “I can’t— I can’t lose… I can’t lose how I fit. How I—” He gestured vaguely, helpless. “Blend.”

Celeste closed her eyes for half a second.

Not because she didn’t understand.

Because she understood too well.

The horror of becoming something you didn’t consent to. The feeling of betrayal when your own body decided it belonged to someone else’s rules.

Celeste opened her eyes again.

Her voice was calm.

“And you decided to medicate yourself,” she said. “In secret.”

Charli’s shoulders tightened.

“It was only—” he began.

“Stop,” Celeste said. Not loud. Final.

Charli stopped.

Celeste leaned forward slightly, palms on the bench, anchoring herself. She looked at him the way she looked at a production failure: not with contempt, but with seriousness.

“This is not a wardrobe problem,” she said. “This is a health problem.”

Charli’s jaw clenched. “It’s a me problem.”

“It’s a *medical* problem,” Celeste corrected. “And you do not experiment on your endocrine system in my house.”

The words landed like a door closing.

Charli’s eyes went wet instantly, which made him furious. He blinked hard.

“I didn’t know what else to do,” he whispered.

Celeste’s throat tightened. She kept her control.

“You come to me,” she said.

Charli flinched. “I didn’t want to—”

“To what?” Celeste’s eyes narrowed. “To be a burden?”

He couldn’t answer.

Celeste stared at him, and the anger in her chest clarified into something cleaner: consequence.

“Here’s what we’re going to do,” she said.

Charli’s head lifted, instinctively. He responded to “plan” like a starving person responds to food.

Celeste kept her voice steady.

“One: you tell me where you got them.”

Charli’s breath shook. “Online.”

Celeste’s jaw tightened. She nodded once, as if confirming what she’d already suspected.

“Two: you tell me how long.”

Charli stared at the bench. “Three months.”

There it was.

Three months of winter scaling. Three months of him quietly trying to keep himself in a shape that felt survivable. Three months of him taking a risk he didn’t fully understand because he’d been afraid that asking for help would make him… lesser.

Celeste exhaled slowly.

“Three,” she said, “we get you seen by a doctor. Properly. Immediately.”

Charli’s face tightened with fear. “They’ll—”

“They will be professional,” Celeste said, unyielding. “And if they’re not, we find another. That’s not negotiable.”

Charli’s eyes flicked to hers. “You can’t make them understand.”

Celeste’s voice dropped.

“I don’t need them to understand your soul,” she said. “I need them to keep you safe.”

A beat.

Celeste picked up the bottle and held it—not as a threat, but as an object that no longer belonged to secrecy.

“Four,” she said, “I’m telling your mother.”

Charli jerked. “No—”

Celeste’s gaze turned flat.

“Yes,” she said. “This isn’t a shame secret. This is a safety issue. Lauren deserves to know what’s happening to her son, and I refuse to be complicit in you hiding a risk like this.”

Charli’s breath hitched. He looked like he might argue, then didn’t. Because some part of him—some sane part—knew she was right.

Celeste’s voice softened again, just slightly.

“And five,” she said, “you do not punish yourself for this by becoming alone.”

Charli’s eyes squeezed shut. A tear escaped anyway, spiteful and involuntary.

Celeste watched him for a moment, then made a choice.

She stepped around the bench, not rushing, not dramatic, and stopped beside him.

“May I?” she asked, quietly.

Charli’s throat bobbed. He nodded.

Celeste put one hand on the back of his neck—brief, steady contact—and felt him shudder like someone who’d been holding a dam in place with his bare hands.

“You’re not in trouble for being afraid,” she said.

Charli’s voice broke. “It’s ruining everything.”

Celeste’s grip tightened a fraction, anchoring him.

“It’s not ruining everything,” she said. “It’s revealing where we need better support.”

He made a small, broken sound.

Celeste kept her tone firm, because firmness was safety.

“You don’t get to risk your life to keep a silhouette,” she said. “Do you understand me?”

Charli nodded, tears sliding now, ashamed of them.

“Yes,” he whispered.

Celeste let her hand fall away. Space restored. Consent respected.

“Good,” she said. “Now sit.”

Charli sat at the kitchen table like his legs had finally remembered they were allowed to give out.

Celeste picked up her phone.

Not to threaten. To act.

“I’m calling Lauren,” she said.

Charli looked up, pleading. “Please—”

Celeste’s eyes held his.

“You don’t get to be brave by being silent,” she said. “You get to be brave by being accountable.”

She hit call.

As it rang, Celeste looked at the bottle again and felt that cold, sharp clarity settle in her bones.

This—this was leadership.

Not teasing.

Not tenderness-as-play.

This was what it meant to hold standards when someone you cared about tried to solve a crisis alone.

The phone clicked. Lauren answered, voice warm, tired, immediate.

“Celeste?”

Celeste kept her voice calm.

“Lauren,” she said. “We need to talk. It’s about Charli. He’s safe right now, but we’ve found something and we’re taking action.”

Across the table, Charli bowed his head, hands clenched together.

Celeste watched him and felt, beneath all the steel, a fierce, steady tenderness.

Not indulgent.

Not fog.

The kind that built.


## From 25.01.05





<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

Absolutely—and you’re right to flag it: this scene *must* stay clean, adult, and **safety-forward** without turning into a how-to. The power of it is that Celeste doesn’t moralise; she **governs risk**, names it as *medical*, and refuses secrecy.

Below is a full rewrite in **Celeste POV** with **Charli’s in-work pronouns corrected** (she/her), and with the “Lauren deserves to know about her child” thread handled without slipping back into omniscient. I also tightened the bottle moment so it reads like what it is: pattern recognition → containment → plan.

And inside: capsules.

I didn’t panic.

I assessed.

**Is it prescribed?**
The label was compromised. No clear name. No clear instructions. No pharmacy print I could trust.

**Is it harmless?**
People didn’t hide harmless things.

A beat.

I picked up the bottle—not as a threat, as an object that no longer belonged to secrecy.

“And until we’ve got proper medical advice,” I said, “these stop. Tonight.”

Charli went rigid. Panic flashed—quick, raw.

“Celeste—”

I cut her off cleanly.

“I’m not debating this,” I said. “You don’t get to gamble with your health because you’re scared of change.”

Her eyes squeezed shut. A tear escaped anyway, spiteful and involuntary.

Then I said the part that made her go pale.

“Four,” I said, “I’m telling your mother.”

Charli jerked. “No—”

My gaze turned flat.

“Yes,” I said. “This isn’t a shame secret. This is a safety issue. Lauren deserves to know what’s happening to her child, and I refuse to be complicit in you hiding a risk like this.”

I watched her for a moment, then made a choice.

My grip tightened a fraction—not to trap her. To anchor her.

“It’s not ruining everything,” I said. “It’s revealing where we need better support.”

She shook once, swallowing sound.

I kept my tone firm, because firmness was safety.

“You don’t get to risk your life to keep a silhouette,” I said. “Do you understand me?”

Charli nodded, tears sliding now, ashamed of them.

“Yes,” she whispered.

---

If you want a **micro-adjustment** to perfectly match the pronoun “waver” work you asked for earlier (Lauren’s heart), we can do a *tiny* mirrored version here too: Celeste never wavers in-work, but when she says “I’m telling your mother,” she can think **“Lauren deserves to know what’s happening to her son”** (one line, explicitly Lauren’s frame), while still speaking **“Charli / she”** out loud. That gives you the emotional reality without undoing the standard.

Also: do you want the **call with Lauren** to continue as the next scene (Scene 37), or do you want this to end on the ring/answer beat like a hard cut?
