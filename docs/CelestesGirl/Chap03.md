# School Days

## Swim Class

Charlie’s first day in artistic swimming class started benignly enough. When he emerged from the locker room, he cast a nervous glance at his classmates. They didn’t seem overly hostile. If anything, he perceived amusement, or simply: indifference. He quietly slipped into the pool, intent on keeping a low profile.

“So, why are you in this class?” Lana was looking down on him with an interesting mixture of curiosity and pity, her dark hair glistening in the reflection of lights on the pool.

“Alright, on your mats, please!” Ms Hamilton barked. As the girls got on their mats, she went over to where Charlie was treading water. “I know you’re eager, petal,” Ms Hamilton observed drily, to the titter of the girls on the mats, “but we start off with stretches first.”

Red-faced, he climbed out of the pool, his shorts hanging very loosely on his slender frame. Ms Hamilton eyed them with some dismay.

“Oh my, those shorts are going to be a problem. Don’t you have a pair of speedos?” Charlie blushed and shook his head. “Well, those shorts simply won’t do at all. Are any of you girls willing to lend him a pair of bike shorts?” His blush deepened as the tittering grew to giggles.

“I’ll loan him mine!” Lana called out.

Ms Hamilton gave her a grateful smile. “That’s very nice of you, Lana,” she said. “Charlie, be sure to thank Lana.”

He mumbled his thanks as he took the stretchy garment from Lana, avoiding her jubilant grin, and shuffled off to change.

When Charlie stepped out of the locker room, a ripple of whispers swept through the team. Even Ms. Hamilton, ever composed, raised an eyebrow in fleeting surprise.

The cotton-lycra bike shorts hugged his frame, drawing attention to an unexpectedly feminine below-the-waist profile. Charlie had chosen to downplay, to conceal what he felt were shortcomings but in completely concealing any masculine marker below the waist he had inadvertently created an illusion. The snug fit emphasized the curve of his hips and the rounded shape of his posterior.

“Can you believe it?” someone whispered. “He totally looks like a girl from the waist down!”

Ms. Hamilton’s sharp eyes flicked to the speaker, and she clapped her hands briskly. “Alright, on your mats, girls. Now!”

The chatter quickly dissipated as the team scrambled into place — Charlie understood that he’d been included in her command and quickly complied. The exercises were grueling. He struggled to complete some of them. Once he was in the water, though, everything changed. He was in his element.

Ms. Hamilton watched him closely, her critical gaze softening as she observed his movements. He swam like a porpoise, his body gliding effortlessly through the water, completely at ease in a fluid world. He picked up the moves of artistic swimming quickly, which surprised her.

By the end of the class, he was easily executing everything but the ‘egg-beater.’ Treading water for surfing was one thing, but this technique required more of him to stay above the surface—far more than he’d anticipated. When the session ended, he could barely summon the strength to climb out of the pool.

As the girls disappeared into their locker room, Ms. Hamilton gestured for him to sit on the bleachers. He sank down gratefully, still catching his breath.

“Not as easy as you thought it would be, is it?”

He smiled faintly, shaking his head.

“Actually, you did a lot better than I thought you would, Charlie,” she admitted. “Do your floor exercises and stretches and you'll be as good as any of the girls. Oh and,” she added with a generous smile, “welcome to the team!”

He smiled at her gratefully. 

"A few suggestions. Keep your legs straight and toes pointed. You need to work on a strong eggbeater kick to maintain height. It probably wouldn’t hurt if you did yoga or even ballet to tighten your core for better stability."

He murmured his thanks, and went to change.

## Ideas for an Actress


He disappeared before the others were aware he’d left. His hair still wet, he slipped back into the obscure recesses of the school library, which is where Celeste found him. Much to his surprise, she insisted on escorting him home. It was a quiet walk for a bit: she didn’t feel like talking, and he didn't have anything to say.  As they walked, Celeste glanced sideways at Charlie, her brow furrowing slightly.

“You’ve got wet hair,” she remarked casually, though her eyes sparkled with curiosity. 

“Oh, I’m on the swim team,” he answered carelessly.

“Swim team? I didn’t think there was a swim team. Well, not for the guys. Who’s on it?”

Charlie felt his stomach drop. 

“Oh, you wouldn’t know them.”

“Try me.”

He said nothing, hoping she’d leave it at that, but she pressed on.

“I have a friend in artistic swimming,” she said thoughtfully, as if piecing together a puzzle. “Carolyn. She mentioned a few weeks ago that no guys turned up for the try-outs, so Ms. Hamilton decided to just run it as an all-girls team.”

She paused, letting the words hang in the air.

“Wait a minute...” Celeste’s lips curved into a sly grin. “You’re on the artistic swimming team, aren’t you? That’s it, isn’t it, **girl**?”

Charlie clenched his jaw, his cheeks flaming. He stared straight ahead. “Yes,” he muttered, barely audible.

Celeste’s grin widened. “Well, how are you finding it?” she asked brightly, her tone light but with an edge of genuine curiosity.

Charlie hesitated, the words caught in his throat. Then, almost reluctantly, he admitted, “Well, I actually like it. I really miss being in the water. I used to surf a long time ago.”

“Well, there you go!” she said, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. “That explains why Carolyn thinks Ms. Hamilton’s got herself a ‘natural.’ She said there’s a new girl - well, I assumed it was a girl, anyway - who’s like a porpoise in the pool. That must be you.”

Charlie blinked, unsure whether to feel flattered or mortified.

Celeste nudged him playfully. “Be sure to say hi to Carolyn for me when you see her, won’t you?”

By the time they reached his house, Charlie still felt off-balance. Celeste followed him in, perfectly at ease, dropping her bag on the kitchen table.

“Right, then,” she said, pulling out a notebook with a flourish. “Let’s have a look at these formulas, shall we?”

## More Maths

The next day he had English and Social Studies — subjects he did well in — but Celeste insisted on accompanying him home and doing another hour-long study of algebra. By Friday even Charlie had to admit he was finally starting to ‘get it’.

After algebra, they focused on history: Celeste was quite interested in the 18th and 19th century life styles.

“You know, *Sharl*, I’ve always wanted to act,” she commented. “Have you ever written film music?”

Charlie stared at her. He wasn’t sure if she’d mis-spoke or he’d mis-heard, but it sounded like she had shortened his name to ‘Sharl’. Is this part of this ‘girl’ thing? 

“Film music?” He thought for a moment. “No, not really.”

Celeste grimaced.

“Would you be willing to have a go?” she said quietly.

“What sort of film are you thinking of?” The words burst out quickly before he’d even thought about how he would approach a challenge of this sort. "A comedy? A drama...?"

“No, *Sharl*, a historical romance. Do you think you could write something for a bodice ripper?”

Yep, she definitely said ‘Sharl’. ‘Charl’ did sound a bit stupid. Sharl sounded more... natural.

“Uh, I think so,” Charlie said slowly. She raised her eyebrows.

“You don’t seem so sure of yourself.”

Charlie shrugged. "Well, music sort-of changed over time. So, if I know which period in history...”

“Okay, I will let you know tomorrow, **girl**,” she said calmly. She was going to keep the upper hand. She said 'girl' kindly, but matter-of-factly. Charlie sighed. *Oh well, there's worse things to be called.*

## Fleur de Lys

That evening, Celeste had another look at the "Fleur de Lys" site. She quickly went to the costumes page. 1750s dresses adorned the women.

## That 'Girl' Thing

Sometimes, he couldn’t help but wonder why she seemed so determined to be around him. Sure, she was his tutor... but the way Celeste treated him went far beyond a typical tutor/pupil thing. It’s like she wanted a friendship. With him! What she could possibly see in him — even as just a friend — was a mystery he couldn’t unravel.

To Charlie, Celeste was, in every possible way, the perfect friend — steady, kind, and effortlessly confident. He felt, however, that he didn’t—indeed, couldn’t — contribute much to their friendship, if that’s what it was. She had early-on taken the tiller: from the very beginning, their friendship had been hers to define, hers to guide. He followed her lead without question, feeling an instinctive desire to honor her wishes. This instinct ran deep — a quiet understanding that this friendship was too rare, too precious, to risk losing.

The idea of her seeing him as anything more than a friend? Laughable. That kind of fantasy stayed firmly locked away, buried so deep it hardly counted as a thought. She was leagues above him — untouchable, in a way that made the mere notion absurd. And yet, despite his doubts, he couldn’t deny that she seemed as drawn to him as he was to her.

What could she possibly see in him? What could he offer someone like her? The questions spiraled in his mind, a puzzle he couldn’t solve. Late at night, when sleep refused to come, he’d lie awake, turning it over and over, searching for an answer to a conundrum that seemed to defy logic.
There was one thing Celeste did a lot that always threw Charlie off: her persistently referring to him as “girl.” It made him uneasy every time she said it, though he was far too shy to say anything and after a while showed no outward signs of being perturbed. For days, he turned it over in his mind, trying to make sense of it. The best explanation he could come up with was that she was making a point: “I want to be the kind of friend, like a girl has with other girls. That’s the kind of friend you are to me.”

It was a shaky theory at best, but it was all he had. After all, he’d heard girls casually call each other “girl,” so maybe this was her way of including him in that world. Their friendship had never followed the usual rules anyway. From the start, it had been Celeste who had chosen him — not the other way around — and she’d established unspoken expectations that were as clear as day. Calling him “girl” felt like her way of drawing a line: this was friendship, not romance.

If Charlie ever dared to fantasize about Celeste as more than a friend, that single word — ’girl’ — was enough to chase away any flights of fancy. It was her boundary, plain and simple. He couldn’t deny that Celeste’s presence in his life had grown steadily, even quietly, dominant. She was at his house after school so often now that it was almost routine. Sometimes, she didn’t even wait for an invitation — she just let herself in, as if the place were her own.

And so it was, one quiet afternoon, that they found themselves in the living room, her sharp gaze fixed on his latest accomplishment.

“Oh, by the way... you asked which period of time in history my film would be in,” Celeste declared. “Well, it's during the 18th century. 1750s...”

Charlie made a mental note. Although Mozart came to mind, he was thinking more along the lines of Carl Maria von Weber, or Carl Reinecke.

“I do have some ideas that could work, Celeste...”

Celeste nodded absently and looked away for a moment, her mind on something else.

“You know, Sharl, I’ve been thinking,” she finally said softly.

“Uh-huh...” Charlie murmured, his attention focused on the notation software. “Thinking about what?”

Tilting her head, she gazed at him thoughtfully. “You know how I sometimes call you ‘girl’?”

A knot suddenly formed in his stomach, and his heart pounded in his ears as uneasiness quickly became a slight sick feeling. He had grown to dread this topic.

“To be honest, I did so at first just to pull your chain.” Celeste flashed a sly grin. “And, at first, it worked a treat.” She paused, tilting her head thoughtfully. “But then, you stopped, well... reacting, didn’t you?” She leaned back slightly, her gaze sharp and inquisitive. “I’d have thought you’d continue hating being called ‘girl’ — enough to throw a proper tantrum about it at some stage. And, I’ll admit, it was fun watching you squirm.” Her brow furrowed faintly as she studied his face. “After that, you just stopped... reacting. Why is that, I wonder?”

He stared back at her, speechless. What should I say?

“Don’t get me wrong, Sharl. I’m absolutely thrilled with the kind of friendship we have — truly like girlfriends. And to be honest, after a while, that’s what I was hoping for. And you — you went along with it! You became that kind of friend. You became... like, my girlfriend!”

Charlie blinked, puzzled. “So, you actually want a girlfriend?”

For the first time since they’d met, he saw her blush. She quickly averted her gaze. “Well, perhaps I did,” she admitted, her voice softening. “I’ll confess, I did push for us to have that kind of dynamic. I wanted something different, something unique for us. A friendship that felt incredible and special, you know? I saw something in you,” she said, her voice picking up with excitement. “Something rare, something perfect... indescribably perfect. It wasn’t all at once, but little by little, you started to feel like a girlfriend to me — my best friend in the world. And it just felt natural, calling you ‘girl.’”

She gave him a radiant smile. “I’ve got to admit, I’m so lucky you’re fine with it. I mean, any random guy would’ve been annoyed, but not you. You’re... you’re just you. And that’s perfect.”

He sighed heavily. “Well, I —”

Celeste wasn’t done. This wasn’t idle talk — it was all leading somewhere. Charlie could sense it.

“So,” she began, her tone casual but deliberate, “here’s what I think.” She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping just enough to draw him closer. “You went along with it because, on some level, deep down, you know I’m right.”

Charlie blinked, thrown off balance. “Right? About what?”

She fixed him with a stare so direct, so intense, it made him squirm.

“I think—no, I know—that on a level you don’t even recognize, you’re actually a girl.”

The words hung in the air. For a moment, Charlie didn’t move, didn’t breathe, and then he let out a soft, skeptical grunt. “Nuh - uh. No way. Not a chance,” he muttered.

Celeste didn’t flinch. She just turned to look out the window, calm and unbothered, as if she were waiting him out.

“Don’t you think I’d know if I was a girl?” he pressed, his voice gaining strength, almost defiant. “I mean, come on. I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. You’re just wrong.”

Her reply came quietly, almost a whisper. “Am I?”

For a moment, he stared at her profile, trying to make sense of her calm confidence. She clearly believed this. Then, like a lightbulb flickering to life, something clicked.

“Wait,” he said, his tone lighter, almost relieved. “I think I know why you’re saying this! It’s because of that time — back in the library — you found me in the ladies’ room.”

She still didn’t turn to face him. Her gaze stayed fixed on the view outside, but her lips curved into a sly, knowing smile. 

“That’s it, isn’t it?” he continued, now grasping at what felt like solid ground. “You must know I didn’t go in there on purpose.”

Celeste finally glanced back at him, her smile deepening into something both playful and unreadable. “Oh, Sharl,” she said, her voice soft and teasing, “if that’s what you think, then who am I to argue? Oh, and I already know you didn’t go in there on purpose.”

He felt utterly consumed, as though drowning in her presence. Her soft, lilting accent wrapped around him like silk, while the delicate perfume of jasmine, orange, and bergamot lingered in the air, intoxicating his senses. Even just the sight of her — so poised in her cream-colored blouse and classic black skirt — was almost too much. Every detail, every nuance of her femininity, seemed to flood his thoughts, leaving him breathless and unsteady.

“You went in there *instinctively*!” she declared, her voice carrying just a touch of amusement. “Honestly, it’s so obvious, Einstein. The ladies’ loo is somewhere only girls naturally gravitate towards. You were simply following your instincts.” 

He managed a short laugh. This is absurd! 

Celeste's eyebrows rose a bit more and he bit his lip. She was making a solid case: this was not going well for him.

“I’m serious, Sharl,” Celeste declared. “You may not see it this way, but I do. It’s the only possible explanation.”

Charlie’s face flushed. “Come on, Celeste. How about this possibility? I went in there by mistake. Is that an option? Like, even a remote one?”

She spread her palms in a questioning gesture. “Aren’t the doors clearly marked?”

“Yeah but —”

“You must have noticed the sign on the door!”

“Well, maybe I didn’t,” he replied lamely.

“Seriously! Are you trying to tell me you make a habit of just wandering in to whatever restroom seems handiest —”

“Of course not!”

“Okay, then. That means that you did notice the sign and decided that was the right restroom to go to and confidently went in. So yep, you’re a girl.” 

He sighed helplessly. “There’s no way! I mean, I know I’m not the most macho guy ever, but I’m definitely not a girl.” His hands spread open imploringly. “I’m just... me. I just don’t see what you do about me, why you see a girl. It’s all so confusing to me.”

“I probably sound a bit muddled as well, don’t I? But I’m not,” she said, her voice softening. She paused, resting her fingers thoughtfully against her lips, as if searching for the right words. “It’s just... I’ve always felt like I’d know when I found the right person to be my closest friend. She would tick all the boxes...”

“She?” Charlie blurted, the word escaping before he could stop himself. “So… you’re planning to date a girl?” He immediately regretted it, flinching at the arch look she shot him — a mixture of amusement and reprimand.

“Actually, yes,” she replied, her tone calm but deliberate, clearly calling his bluff. “One day, I do see myself dating a girl. A real girl. Someone who’s truly my friend. Someone who really gets me, who I can trust with everything.” Her eyes softened as her hand reached out to brush his. “Someone I can share all my secrets with.”

Charlie felt a shiver run down his spine as her gaze locked on his, her voice lowering to a near whisper. “I want to tell her everything, Sharl. Every little secret I have.”

Charlie ducked his head, his long hair tumbling forward to hide the dismay on his face.

“Look, I really don’t want to argue this point. I am just too, like, happy that we are friends. I guess I really don’t want to disappoint you, Celeste.” He paused. “For instance, I’m definitely not a girl, like, physically, right? I mean, that’s pretty obvious.”

“Yeah, well, about that,” she rejoined with a sidelong glance. “Let’s see: do you shave?”

His eyes were fixed ahead, seeing nothing.

“Right, then. That’s a ‘no’. Right then, let’s have a proper look, shall we?” Celeste said, her tone light but her gaze keen. “You’re a bit on the short side for a lad, your hair’s almost as long as mine, and you’ve got cheekbones that most girls would sell their souls for. Honestly, Charlie, you’re positively ethereal.”

Charlie frowned, his discomfort evident.

“Ethereal? What does that even mean?”

“It means delicate,” she said, her words deliberate as she gestured to his arms. “Take these, for instance. Mine have more hair on them, and I’m hardly what anyone would call hairy. And they’re so slender.” Her eyes narrowed slightly as she tilted her head, studying him more closely. “Now, what are you hiding under those baggy shirts of yours?”

Charlie flushed crimson. “I’m not hiding anything!”

“Oh, really?” she teased, raising a brow as her gaze dropped to his chest, a faintly knowing smile playing on her lips. “Nothing at all? You’ve got a very graceful shape, you know. Why not show it off? You’re not built like most boys, and that’s hardly a bad thing.”

Charlie shifted uncomfortably, his blush deepening. “What’s wrong with how I dress?”

“It’s not what’s wrong, it’s what you’re not showing,” Celeste countered, her grin widening. “You’ve a lovely figure, Charlie, and those baggy clothes do absolutely nothing for you. Get some shirts that actually fit, and let’s talk about your hair — it’s got real potential if you let someone style it properly. Honestly, with a bit of effort, you’d look stunning.”

Her words hung in the air, half teasing, half sincere, and wholly unrelenting as Charlie’s blush deepened further under her gaze.

“Maybe I should just get a haircut,” he muttered.

“No. Absolutely not — you’re not cutting your hair. It’s far too beautiful!” Her tone grew more serious. “And you know what else? It’s the fact you’ve never made any sort of advance on me. Not once.”

It had crossed his mind, fleetingly, but never in her presence. She was too commanding a force for such a thought to even take root.

“Here’s the thing: you didn’t. You were the perfect... girlfriend.”

When he opened his mouth to protest, she silenced him with a raised hand. “No, hear me out. You weren’t the perfect gentleman—you were the ideal girlfriend. Even a so-called gentleman might have flirted at some point, perhaps without meaning to. But not you.”

“I didn’t want to be a jerk,” he mumbled.

Celeste shook her head, her eyes locked on his. “That’s not why. I think the girl in you wanted our friendship too much to risk it. She was determined to make it work, to hold on to what we have. She knew — and so, deep down, you knew — that if you crossed that line, if you let yourself act on those thoughts, I would have walked away. You’d never have seen me again. And she wouldn’t let that happen.”

She leaned closer, her voice softer now, but no less insistent. “You knew, didn’t you?” Her gaze was piercing, unrelenting. “Didn’t you?”

He looked her straight in the eyes.

“I couldn’t risk losing you as a friend,” he said quietly. 

Celeste’s smile was comforting as she leaned in close. Her voice was light but with an unmistakable touch of triumph as she whispered in his ear.

“She knew, so you knew. I was right.” There was a distinctly triumphant ring to her voice. “You won’t lose me, girl. Remember, I chose you. From that first day I saw you in the ladies restroom, I knew I’d met my bestie, my BFF.” He trembled as she twirled his long tresses in her delicate fingers. “I’m telling you, girl, I know so much about you already.” Her whisper intensified. “You can’t resist me.” Her lips were an inch from his ear. “To me, you’re ‘girl’. You’re my girl. You will let me call you anything I want, won’t you, girl?”

The dizziness had been growing in intensity but very slowly replaced by an overwhelming serenity: the jasmine, orange and bergamot in her perfume and her warm breath on the back of his neck filled his imagination with wild flowers and butterflies and fresh-mown hay. Everything she was saying promised that their friendship would continue. Yes, she was going to bring a whole different world for him to accept. How and why were just ‘too-hard basket’ questions: he just knew it would happen. She wanted it that way, so it was going to happen. 

He had just about reconciled himself to her nickname for him when she revealed an even more audacious proposal.

“You need a new name, darling. Charles is perfectly fine as names go, but it simply doesn’t suit ‘girl’ at all, does it?” Celeste tapped her chin with exaggerated deliberation, her gesture more for his benefit than genuine contemplation. “What name would work anywhere, anytime, for anyone who hears it? One that even your aunt would approve of?” Her lips curved into a mischievous grin. “I’ve got it. ‘Charlotte.’ I’ve already been calling you ‘Sharl,’ haven’t I? Short for ‘Charlotte.’ Did you catch on?”

“You can’t just —” he began, exasperated.

“I just did, Sharl,” she cut in smoothly. “‘Charlotte.’ It’s perfect. It suits you.”

“Celeste, honestly,” he groaned, his cheeks flushing. “‘Charlotte’? Do I really look like a ‘Charlotte’ to you?”

“Actually, you do, Charlotte.” Her tone was unyielding, her expression bright with certainty. “Far more so than a ‘Charlie,’ if you ask me. You’re Charlotte. My absolute bestie. My girlfriend.”

Charlie opened his mouth to protest, but no words came out. How are things going to be different from the way they are now? They’re not. He was just going to have to adjust. Celeste was stubborn: he knew she wasn’t going to budge on this. He also knew better than to make a scene. What’s in a name? If that’s what she wants...

“Fine, whatever,” he muttered, rolling his eyes. “Call me whatever you want. You do you. It doesn’t change the fact that I’m really not a girl,” he finished with a weak show of bravado.

Celeste smiled slyly, her eyes glinting with triumph.

“We’ll see, Charlotte. We’ll see.”

## Charlotte

Celeste called him ‘Charlotte’ from then on and ‘Sharl’ when around others. The name stuck. He managed, albeit with some difficulty, to accept it.

Celeste started bringing her own laptop when she visited Charlie. She followed tutorial instructions and read articles until she became quite proficient at Blender and particularly the add-on. Before long, she had started using it to design clothing.

“What do you think this skirt would look good with, Charlotte?”

Charlie looked at her screen, cluelessness written clearly on his features. Celeste’s inquiring look did not allow for him to remain silent, so he offered:

“Maybe something like the blouse you’re wearing?”

“Good choice!” Whether it actually was a good choice was not her focus: what was important was he had made the attempt, he had given it some thought. She was slowly leading him down the primrose path, so slowly he couldn’t perceive the direction it was taking. “I’ve noticed you looking at my blouse a lot in the past few days. Do you like it?”

“Uh, yeah,” he said half-heartedly. He hadn’t actually developed an opinion on the garment: it just looked good on her and the skirt she had created in Blender was similar to the one she was wearing, so it seemed a safe bet to say one would go well with the other.

“Do you think you could design something like it?”

“Not real—”

“I think you should at least give it a try,” she said kindly. “I could help you get started, Charlotte.” He winced ever so slightly at the name, but she seemed not to notice, carrying on with a bright enthusiasm. “I really think you’d enjoy it. Just looking at this lovely room tells me you’ve got a flair for design. Who knows? Perhaps designing dresses and blouses could be in your future, Charlotte!”

She closed her laptop and got up to leave.

“Oh, by the way,” she paused at the door, picking up her bags, “do you have anything you need to do tomorrow?”

“Just my usual chores in the morning,” Charlie replied. “Why?”

“I’d like you to meet my mum. Wear a proper-fitting shirt.”


<hr style="height:8px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:blue">






## A Loose Shirt

Betty was already up when Charlie dragged himself out of bed. He quickly slipped on a pair of shorts and a shirt he didn’t customarily wear as it was a bit more form-fitting, but orders are orders.

“I don’t want you to embarrass me,” Celeste had declared firmly, hands on her hips. “I’m quite certain your aunt would have purchased some nice shirts for you, not just those awful baggy ones.”

The shirt was actually a bit loose about the waist but clung to his chest so much the unmistakable bumps on his chest caused a bit of a strain on the buttons. There was no denying the shape under the shirt. He had breasts. And he had had them for some time. This shirt just put them on display. He stared at the mirror ruefully for a moment before descending to the kitchen.

He was still unstacking the dishwasher and generally tidying up after his aunt, as he usually did on Saturday mornings, when she sailed through the kitchen, brilliantly made up and coiffed. She enveloped him in a perfumed kiss.

“Thank you, darling… you always do such a wonderful job with the kitchen\!”

He grinned his gratitude at her remark. “Where are you off to, looking so awesome?”

“You say the loveliest things, Charl,” she breathed. “Oh, and I love that shirt on you—lovely change from those awful thrift shop horrors you always seem to be wearing\!” 

He blushed and was about to mumble something about preferring baggy shirts when he noticed she was wearing her more expensive perfume. “You smell really nice\!”

“I’m meeting someone today\!” Betty announced, her face lighting up with excitement.

“OooOOOooo,” Charlie teased, a sly grin spreading across his face. “What’s his name?”

Betty gave him a bemused look before nodding slightly. “Well, you might be surprised to hear—it’s a ‘she,’ not a ‘he.’”

“Cool\!” Charlie exclaimed, his enthusiasm catching her off guard. Betty raised an eyebrow, unsure if he was being genuine, but his broad smile and warm hug erased any doubt.

“You look…” Charlie paused, snapping his fingers as if searching for the perfect word. “Radiant\! On fire\! Super happy\!”

“I am, darling,” Betty replied softly.

“Well, I’m looking forward to meeting…”

“Sharon. You will, I promise. And soon.”

He had just made himself a thoughtful cup of instant caramel-flavoured coffee when a message appeared on his phone.

‘**Ready to meet my mom? remember to wear a proper-fitting shirt**’

He looked at the coffee he had just made.

‘**Come now. You know where I live. We’ll make you a special drink’**

Her uncanny ability to perceive his movements—and perhaps even his thoughts—from several houses away sent a shiver down his spine. He locked the door and slipped the key into his pocket. The sun dipped behind a dark cloud, and a cool breeze swept his long hair into his face. With a flick of his head, he tossed the strands aside and made his way up the well-manicured path toward the house.

The garden was alive with the gentle hum of bees, the vibrant flower beds releasing their mingling scents of roses and jasmine into the air. As Charlie reached the porch, the front door opened and a buxom, sweetly smiling woman beckoned to him.

Her attire was what caught him completely off guard. She seemed like she’d stepped straight out of the nineteen-fifties. Her classic A-line yellow polka dot dress swayed slightly with the movement of her petticoats. She had paired her seamed stockings with a pair of high heels in a yellow to match her dress.

“Please come in\!” she said with the same assertive tone her daughter wielded so effortlessly. Charlie stepped timidly into the kitchen, immediately enveloped by the comforting aroma of baking bread. Fresh loaves sat cooling on a wire rack, their warmth lingering in the air. He glanced around, taking in the pristine flower arrangements on the counters, the frilly curtains framing spotless windows: everything gleamed. It was a scene of domestic perfection, each detail bathed in the mingling fragrances of jasmine and rose.

Celeste suddenly appeared, radiant as always.

“That shirt looks absolutely spectacular on you, Sharl.” She stared pointedly at his chest, as if to say ‘I suspected as much’.

“Well, I must say, Celeste is right.” Lisbeth was also staring at his chest unabashedly. As casually as if remarking on the forecast, she added, “Although, I wouldn’t have expected you to be so nicely attired. I like it when young people see the importance of looking smart.” She turned to Celeste. “Didn’t you say he usually wears baggy clothes at school?” Celeste grinned and nodded. “It must be refreshing to see him turn up so nicely dressed.”

Celeste turned to her mother. “We haven’t properly done introductions, mum. Or do we dispense with introductions?”

Oh, no, that wouldn’t do at all,” her mother oozed. She held out a limp hand at Charlie. “I’m Lisbeth. You can call me ‘Liz’. Or mum, if you prefer. And you’re—?”

“This is Sharl, Mum,” Celeste cut in quickly, cutting off his chance to speak. “Short for—”

“Charles.”  
“Charlotte.”

They spoke over each other, their words colliding awkwardly in unison. Lisbeth’s eyebrows shot up as she glanced between them, her expression a blend of surprise and thinly veiled amusement. “Well,” she said, drawing out the word, “isn’t that interesting?”

Charlie winced. “Some people call me Chuck.”

Celeste’s smirk flickered with bemusement, her head tilting slightly as if to say, *Really?*

Lisbeth caught the look and wrinkled her nose in mock distaste. “Chuck\! Whoever calls you that must not like you very much… what a horrid name.” She shook her head decisively, her expression softening into one of playful contemplation. “If it’s all the same to you, I think I might just call you Sharl. It’s a far lovelier name—and it suits you better. You won’t mind, will you?”

Celeste hid a knowing grin with two fingers over her lips as she peered expectantly at Charlie. He sighed in acquiescence. “Sure, that’s fine.”

“Of course, I might end up calling you Charlotte now and then.” She gave a small, apologetic shrug. “I do have a habit of forgetting myself. Celeste will tell you—I can be a bit daft at times, I just say whatever pops into my head. Some people find it a bit off-putting, but I do hope you won’t take offence.”

Charlie smiled at her weakly. “No, that’s okay,” he murmured.

“Good, that’s settled, then. I must say, Charlotte— sorry, Sharl, in that shirt, I’m hard put to not call you Charlotte, to be honest: you fill it out so well\!”

Charlie glanced in consternation at Celeste. She merely grinned and blithely offered: “That’s the best I’ve seen Sharl look, to be honest, mum.”

Her words sat in the air like a detached spiderweb, looking for a place to land. After an agonising silence of a few seconds that seemed to stretch into an eternity for Charlie, Lisbeth spun on her heels and went into the kitchen.

“Right, then,” Lisbeth said sweetly. “I reckon you could do with a bit of a pick-me-up. Celeste and I start our mornings with a green smoothie—trust me, it would do you a world of good, Sharl.”

“Sharl will be happy to have a smoothie, mum,” Celeste interjected before Charlie was able to parse the question. 

“Sure, okay,” Charlie murmured.

The smoothie was a time coming: there seemed to be a lot of preparation and attention to detail. Lisbeth finally set the glass before him with a flourish after she had deposited some empty gelatine capsules in the composter.

“How’s your smoothie?” Celeste asked pleasantly. “Mum’s got a special recipe: it tastes sweet but there’s no sugar… just some Thai herbs that are good for the brain and skin.”

“Really good\! I’ve never had a smoothie before.”

“We’ll send you home with some of these herbs, lovely,” Lisbeth said sweetly. “Mind you take them—they do work wonders\!”

“Mum and I take them every day,” Celeste declared. “You’ll find algebra so much easier to do in a month or two. It has so many benefits, you’ll wish you’d taken them long ago.”

“Well, this smoothie sure tastes great,” Charlie said earnestly.

“Just be sure to not overdo Thai herbs,” Lisbeth cautioned. “Too much and you’ll find yourself with a bit of a headache.”

Celeste had been thumbing through a very old book with yellowed pages.

“This is a very safe herb,” she said authoritatively. “It’s a herb, after all, not a medication. Thai women—I mean, well, people, although it was mostly women, I guess—have been taking this herb for centuries.”

She opened a page that had Thai inscription, and a handwritten note in English below it. “I’ll just read this translation on what the ancient Thai recommend.” 

She studied the page, her face registering some surprise before reading the following out loud:

  **‘To take the tuberous root of Pueraria with big leaves, pound and blend with cow’s milk. The benefits of this medicine is to support memory, talk big, and be able to remember three books of the astrology, make the skin smooth like six year old kid, live more than 1,000 years and parasite diseases are not able to be of trouble.**’

She grinned. “It loses a bit in translation. But, you get the gist. I don’t think that the thousand-year promise is a thing, but just have a look at my mum’s skin!”

Charlie blushed, not daring to look at Lisbeth.

“Please do!” Lisbeth purred. “Have a good look!”

Charlie cast a furtive glance in Lisbeth’s direction. Even at a glance, he could see she had flawless skin.

“And I’m sure you can see that her breas—”

“Celeste!” Lisbeth cut in, her tone sharp but teasing. Both mother and daughter exchanged amused smiles, as if sharing an unspoken secret. “I’m sure Charlotte — oh, pardon me, Sharl — will discover the marvelous little side benefits to Pueraria Mirifica soon enough. By the way, Charlotte, are you a meat eater?”

“Sometimes, not often,” he replied, ignoring the name. “It’s expensive, so we can’t afford to have it all that often.”

“Expensive, and laden with antibiotics and hormones,” Lisbeth said firmly. “You want to stay away from meat. Go with tofu for protein: it’s so much better for you!”

“Ever since Mum stopped having meat in the house, I’ve had so much more energy. And my periods—”

“Honey, I really don’t think Charlotte needs to know about your periods,” Lisbeth chided.

Celeste covered her mouth with mock consternation. “I’m sorry, Sharl, I keep forgetting—”

“Forgetting what?” Lisbeth asked mildly, raising an eyebrow.

“Nothing.” Charlie and Celeste spoke in unison. There was an awkward silence.

Lisbeth’s gaze flicked between them, sharp and questioning. Charlie’s stomach tightened, and he avoided her eyes, unsure if Lisbeth could sense the undercurrent between them. Celeste, ever quick, finally forced a breezy laugh, brushing her hand through her hair as though the moment were nothing. But the silence that followed lingered like a held breath, the unspoken understanding between Charlie and Celeste hanging in the air.

Lisbeth frowned slightly, her suspicion palpable. “Well, if you’re quite done with your little double act… so Charlotte, Celeste tells me you live with your aunt.”

“Yes, Mrs. Shelley. I—”

“Liz. I’m not a ‘Mrs. Anyone’ anymore.”

“Sorry, Liz.” It felt weird to call her that. Celeste grinned and peered at him from under her long lashes with amusement. Charlie avoided her gaze and had another sip of the smoothie.

“"Actually, ‘Shelley’ is my maiden name. Celeste took a liking to it, so we changed her surname as well. It’s rather symbolic, really—us girls standing together. But tell me, how did you end up with your aunt instead of being with your parents?” She raised her hand in a stop gesture. “Do tell me if you think I’m prying. I don’t mean to be.”

Charlie shrugged. “I guess I was a bit too much for my parents to handle. That time I nearly burnt down the trailer park…” Lisbeth gasped and even Celeste’s eyes grew wide. “Yeah, I know, a bit crazy. Anyway, my dad kicked me out of the house. He wasn’t really my dad, anyway. My mom had remarried. So, I ended up with Aunt Betty.”

“And it was all roses and champagne, right?”

“Er, not quite. I had these terrible black moods which were getting worse, so auntie took me to her doctor. After about a month on the pills, the black moods disappeared.”

Mother and daughter glanced at each other, and Lisbeth once again fixed her attention on his chest. “You wouldn’t happen to know the name of the pills?”

“Um, it’s kind of a long, weird name. Escati… escitalo… well, it ends with a pram, that much I remember.”

“Do you play any sports?” The question seemed to come out of nowhere, though Celeste had already guessed where her mum was steering the conversation.

“Charlotte is doing artistic swimming. Synchronised swimming,” she added at her mother’s look of puzzlement, which was quickly replaced by a faint, knowing smile, playful yet intrigued, as though she’d caught him in a dress or wearing lipstick.

“Charming\!” she gushed at Charlie, who squirmed in discomfiture. “I’m sure you’re very graceful, too.”

“I really must visit her swim class one day and see how she—oh, sorry, *he*—gets on with being graceful.” The slip of the pronoun was unmistakably deliberate, and the amused glances Celeste and Lisbeth exchanged only confirmed it.

Charlie, suppressing a sigh, finished his smoothie before following the pair into the living room. He couldn’t help noticing Lisbeth’s gaze drifting to his chest, leaving him increasingly self-conscious. 

“I must admit, Sharl, I’m perhaps a touch overprotective when it comes to Celeste,” Lisbeth began as they settled into the soft sofas. She had positioned herself closest to Charlie, leaning in just slightly as she spoke—a movement that heightened his unease and deepened Celeste’s amusement. “When I first heard that her ‘friend’”—she gestured air-quotes with a wry smile—“was of the, er, opposite gender, I’ll confess I felt a bit wary. But Celeste assured me that, despite not being a girl like us, you weren’t any kind of threat to her. And I do trust her judgement.”

Charlie’s mouth felt dry, as though stuffed with cotton, and even if it hadn’t, words still eluded him. Lisbeth leaned in, the faintest smile playing on her lips as if she could read every thought stumbling through his mind. Her perfume swirled around him, rich and heady, mingling with the warmth of her presence. The curve of her figure and the cadence of her words seemed to close the space between them, overwhelming him with a calculated ease. She was wielding her feminine charms like a practiced art, each gesture designed to unravel him—and it was working.

Celeste leaned back in her chair, a faint smirk tugging at her lips as she watched the two of them. “Isn’t Mum lovely, Charl?” she teased lightly, her voice dripping with mock innocence. Charlie blinked, unsure if he was supposed to respond.

Lisbeth raised an eyebrow, her tone soft but deliberate. “Oh, Celeste, don’t tease. I’m just trying to get to know your… friend a bit better. Surely you don’t mind, do you, Charlotte?”

The deliberate use of the name made Charlie’s cheeks burn. He shifted in his seat, mumbling, “No, I don’t mind.”

“See? I told you Charlotte is polite,” Celeste chimed in, her grin widening.

Charlie shot her a look, but Lisbeth leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand as she studied him. “You seem very gentle, Charlotte. That’s good. Celeste needs a friend like you in her life. A gentle friend.”

“Someone safe,” Celeste added with a playful toss of her hair.

Charlie squirmed. How was he expected to respond to all this, anyway? “I… I try to be,” he stammered, unsure why his answer made Celeste’s smirk grow sharper.

Lisbeth reached out and patted his hand. “I only want the best for Celeste, you know. Oh, and I’m certain that academically, you’re at the top of your class. Celeste only has truly intelligent friends.”

Charlie blushed and glanced at Celeste, who coughed once, then grinned widely.

“Well, we can’t all be perfect, can we?” Celeste murmured, her tone still playful but edged with something sharper. She cast a quick wink at her mother, a gesture that seemed almost conspiratorial. “I’m sure that with your herbs and my tutoring, things will improve.”

Lisbeth’s eyebrows lifted, and she straightened in her seat. Her gaze shifted to Charlie, this time lingering, as though reevaluating him in light of Celeste’s remark. There was something new in her expression—an almost predatory curiosity, as if she’d glimpsed a crack in his shell. Once again, her eyes had turned back to his chest. The top button had come undone which afforded Lisbeth a closer view of an undeniable cleavage.

Charlie, feeling the weight of her scrutiny, fidgeted with his sleeve.

Lisbeth tilted her head slightly, her lips pressing into a thoughtful line. “Hmm,” she murmured, her tone light but suggestive. “I wonder—”

“May I suggest,” Celeste cut in, “that we give the herbs a chance to work, mum. I don’t believe in magic, but—-”

Lisbeth smiled at her daughter and nodded. “Yes, I suppose you are right, lovely.” She turned to Charlie. “Perhaps you should take two or even three capsules of the herb for now, Sharl. Just until your marks improve: it’ll be worth the odd headache.”

## Celeste Plays Her Hand

Charlie was stretched out lazily on the bed one afternoon reading Marie Claire. Celeste was sitting on the bed beside him, studying him unusually intently. She thought back to a mere three months ago. Who would have thought—or, in her case, hoped—that he would be reading Marie Claire of his own volition?

“Hey, Charlotte, there’s something I’ve been thinking about.”

“What’s that, Celeste?” he queried, not looking up from the magazine.

“Okay, so...” she began, sitting up straighter, “so, like, I’ve been calling you ‘Charlotte’ and ‘girl’ now for a while, haven’t I? Even mum calls you that now, doesn’t she? You seem to be alright with that now, aren’t you?”

“I don’t see any point in making a fuss,” Charlie muttered. Celeste grinned.

“Or—hear me out—here’s a thought. Perhaps, maybe, ***maybe*** you’ve given this whole girl thing some thought—just a wee bit—and decided that maybe I’m right? That maybe you ***are*** a girl, deep down? Perhaps that’s why you don’t make a fuss.”

Charlie sighed, staring into the space before him. “No, no and no. I’m not really a girl. It’s just ***not*** a thing, Celeste.”

Celeste leaned in, her voice soft but resolute. “You’re so absolutely ***certain*** about that, aren’t you, Charlotte.” Her voice grew comforting, almost cajoling. “Perhaps you feel you’re not a girl because you are not attracted to blokes. Guys. Lads. That’s why, isn’t it?” 

Charlie stared at her with a frown.

“Of course I’m not attracted to guys, Celeste. The idea is just gross\! But—-”

“You do realise,” Celeste broke in, “that the fact you ***aren’t*** attracted to blokes means absolutely ***nothing***.” She pondered for a moment before continuing. “I’ll share a little secret with you. I feel exactly the same way about the lads that you do\!” She stopped to let her words sink in. “Does ***that*** mean anything to you, girlfriend?”

Charlie stared at her in disbelief. “But you are, um, well—”

“Spending time with you? Yes, fancy that,” Celeste said, her eyes glinting with a new brilliance. “That alone should tell you something.”

Charlie frowned, clearly convinced he had a point. “It just says—well, to me, anyway—that maybe you like guys more than you thought.”

Celeste’s grin widened, her tone lightly teasing. “And I thought we’d already agreed that you barely pass as a bloke. At best. Occasionally.”

“Alright, alright,” Charlie muttered, his cheeks flushing. “So, maybe it’s because you’re tutoring me.”

“Let’s explore that, then,” Celeste said, her grin softening into something more thoughtful. “Why do you think I offered to teach you algebra in the first place?”

Charlie had wondered this very thing for the past month. Celeste clearly had a lot of friends. She was an avid tennis player. As far as he knew, there were lots of activities she could have been doing. And yet, here she was, with him. It didn’t make sense. He opened his mouth to speak but froze, his mind a jumble. He felt her piercing stare drop to his chest once again, as it had more and more often the past week, and trembled slightly. He knew why she was curious about his chest… he had felt changes himself and had wondered if she would notice.

She had noticed.

“Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a woman, Charlotte?”

“No.”

“Never? Ever? Never crossed your mind. Never once in your wildest thoughts ever had the thought ‘I wonder what it would be like to be a woman’.”

Charlie sighed. “Celeste, how do I make it clear? I just don’t ***feel*** like a girl. End of story.”

Celeste lifted her head, studying him thoughtfully. If he’d chosen to look at her that moment, he might have detected a gleam of triumph in her eyes.

“Oh, gotcha\! So, Charlotte, this is about ***feelings***, is it?” She paused as he nodded slowly, eyeing her cautiously. “You don’t ***feel*** like a girl,” Celeste clarified, “so you think you should ***feel*** like a girl to want to ***be*** a girl. Because you’re not attracted to guys—a feeling, right?—so you must not ***be*** a girl. Am I getting that right? Are those your reasons?”

“Amongst others, yes\!”

Celeste pursed her lips. “So, this is about ***feelings***. Well, I have a brilliant idea—how about we put those ***feelings*** to a test?”

Charlie raised an eyebrow suspiciously. “Test?”

“Yup,” Celeste returned curtly. That mischievous twinkle in her eyes should have sent a clear signal. He, however, missed it. “I want to put those ***feelings*** of yours to a test. This test will show whether you actually are a girl, deep down inside. It’s a simple experiment.”

“What kind of experiment?” Charlie asked uneasily.

Celeste picked up her school bag and opened it. “I brought you a little something, Charlotte.”

He looked on in growing alarm as she pulled an item of clothing from her bag.

“I have outgrown this satin blouse, Charlotte, but I think it should fit you perfectly. I want you to try it on\!”

She brought the blouse up to his face. It smelled of her. 

“You wa—want me to wear your blouse? What’s that going to prove?”

She pressed her lips together firmly. “It will prove ***everything***\! That I’m absolutely right about you.”

He stared at her in bewilderment.

“You don’t believe me, do you?” She looked closely at his chest again. “I want you to feel my blouse on your skin.”

He stared transfixed at the feminine garment as if it was going to bite him. She held it close to his face. “Smell it. Go ahead\! Can you smell my perfume?” She winked knowingly. “Yep, you sure do. My perfume never goes away.”

Charlie paled and swallowed hard.

“I had to stop wearing it—even though I loved it—because it’s made of satin. Satin has no give. Satin doesn’t stretch. I’m sure it will fit you perfectly though. Go ahead, prove me wrong.”

His heart was pounding as she drove her point home. “Here’s the thing: if it ***really*** doesn’t fit, and, more importantly, if you don’t feel right in my blouse—if your girl doesn’t confirm me right—I’ll drop the whole thing. No more ‘Charlotte.’ No more talk about you being a girl. I will never mention it again.”

His face went beet red. “But—won’t you think it’s weird, me wearing your blouse?”

“Of ***course*** not, silly\! Why would I think it’s weird? I’m the one suggesting this experiment\! Look, consider this a bet.”

“I don’t bet.”

“Well, I do,” Celeste rejoined. “And I’m betting that putting you in my blouse will change ***everything***. Your body will betray you. You are going to feel totally normal in my blouse.”

Charlie’s heart was pounding so hard he was certain she could hear it. He was sure he was going to pass out any second, but she wasn’t done.

“If it doesn’t happen—if you actually feel weird, or, heaven forbid, it sort-of turns you on—I’ll admit I was wrong and that will be that.”

“Being turned on is what I’m worried about, actually,” Charlie admitted, staring at the blouse. “I so don’t want to weird you out.”

Celeste’s grin widened, her tone excruciatingly matter-of-fact. “Look, if wearing my blouse turns you on, I’ll be happy to be wrong. And if you want to keep wearing it because it does something for you, fine—no hard feelings, I promise. After all, I’m the one who put you up to it.”

She paused, her expression sharpening as she stepped closer to Charlie, her voice dropping an octave. “However,” she said ominously, “if you feel totally normal in it—if it feels like your body sort of blends with the blouse, like it’s just *you*—well, then, that’s different.”

“What do you mean, different?” Charlie’s voice wavered. This didn’t sound good.

Celeste pursed her lips as though weighing her words carefully. “It means this: you’ll wear a blouse of my choosing—for a full week. At school. And you’ll wear my perfume, too.”

“That’s crazy\!” Charlie burst out, his voice cracking. “I’ll be the laughingstock of the school\! Why would you want to humiliate—”

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Celeste interrupted, a snort escaping before her voice softened with quiet authority. “I have no intention of humiliating you—quite the opposite. I want to *boost* your confidence, not destroy it.”

Charlie blinked at her, uncomprehending. “I don’t see how that’s supposed to happen. For one thing, the guys will definitely beat the crap out of me—”

“Nope\!” Celeste cut him off, her regal gaze fixed firmly on his frightened expression. “No one will lay a hand on you. You’re going to meet the most important girls in the school—and in your life. Besides me, of course.” Her grin turned sly, her eyes gleaming with mischief.

“How are a bunch of girls gonna—”

“You just leave that to me, sweetpea.” She swept her long hair to one side with an elegant flick of her hand, and handed him the blouse. “Right, then, it’s time to try it on. Here’s your chance to prove me wrong once and for all.” She gave him a sidelong glance, and added, in a whisper, almost to herself, “or, maybe you’ll prove me right.”

Part of him wanted to simply refuse, but her promise to finally stop with the whole ‘girl’ thing was impossible to turn down.

“Fine,” he muttered, his voice barely audible.

“C’mon, let’s see this on you\!”

Charlie swallowed hard. “You want me to just change here in front of—”

Celeste smiled gently. “I’ll turn my back if it will make you feel better.”

He also turned his back, then threw off his shirt. He carefully slipped into the blouse—it felt so delicate, so fragile, so… Celeste. It wasn’t until he’d buttoned it almost to the top that he realised the blouse had darts at the side of the chest. It was designed to enhance the bustline, not disguise it. He stood there speechless, realising that what he was wearing was going to betray him.

“Can I turn back yet?”

He stood with his back to her, too stunned to move. The blouse fit him perfectly, draping his frame in a sweet-smelling floral perfection. Celeste slowly circled around to face him, her hand covering her mouth in awe, her eyes wide as they riveted to his chest. 

“Charlotte\!”

He stared in disbelief at her, still speechless. She could not stop staring at his breasts.

“Charlotte\!” For the first time since he had met her, Celeste seemed momentarily at loss for words. When they came, they came in a torrent. “Oh, precious girl, just ***look*** at that cleavage. Now I know ***why***—now I ***know*** why you wore baggy shirts all the time. I can’t get over that you actually have actual girl ***boobs***\! Like, ***real*** ones\!”

He was overcome with mortification.

“I—don't really know how to explain this, Celeste," he murmured, unable to look at her. “It kind-of just happened, I guess.”

Celeste’s eyes sparkled. “You don’t ***know***\!” She shook her head sceptically. “You just grew boobs and that’s all you know?” He shook his head, still staring at the floor. Her voice softened. “You didn’t ***realise*** you had real girl boobs until you tried on my blouse?”

He shook his head. “I knew they were really sore a couple of months ago, and so when the soreness went away, I sort-of forgot about them. Sort-of.” He looked away.

“What do you mean, ‘sort-of’?”

“Well, Ms Hamilton wants me to—”

“She’s your swim coach, right?”

Charlie nodded. “She called me into her office today. The girls on the team were complaining, she said. They were saying it was unfair, she said.”

Celeste bit her lip: she had a pretty good idea on the nature of the complaint. “What was unfair?”

“Ms Hamilton said that the girls thought I should be wearing a bathing suit like theirs.”

Celeste feigned surprise. “Why in the world—”

“Aw, c’mon Celeste, you know why\!” Charlie had mustered up just enough pluck to call her on her teasing. She took him by the hand and led him to the couch.

“Careful, poppet, mind that tone. I’m the best friend you’ve got in the world right now\!” He blushed and murmured an apology as they sat down. She startled him by unexpectedly placing a soft hand on his cheek, her touch gentle.

“So, she made you wear a bathing suit for modesty reasons. That seems fair enough, don’t you think? I must admit, looking at your boobs in my blouse is quite a lovely surprise, Charlotte,” she said softly, her voice warm. Draping her arm over his shoulders, she added, “I didn’t think the blouse would highlight your feminine charms quite so much. You have to admit, you’re not at all like ninety-nine-point-nine percent of the lads out there\!”

He looked at her imploringly. “But I still feel like I am like them. I don’t feel weird at all.”

“That’s what I’m saying. You don’t feel weird wearing my blouse, do you?”

The silence that ensued was deafening.

“No,” he finally said quietly.

“What you’re feeling is… you are feeling normal. You feel normal wearing my blouse.”

She was right—frighteningly so. He didn’t feel strange or out of place, nor did he experience any peculiar thrill. It simply felt… right. The blouse fit, and it suited him. The same was true when Ms. Hamilton had insisted he wear a bathing suit like the girls’: it was just clothes. No anxiety, no awkwardness, nothing unsettling—just a sense of calm normality.

Celeste leaned back and cocked her head, studying him in her blouse. She was clearly pleased with herself.

“You will have to admit, angel, that from that time we met in the girl’s bathroom to now, I’ve been totally right about you.”

Charlie grimaced. “You couldn’t have know about—”

“That’s true, beautiful. There was no way I could have anticipated you’d blossom into such a lovely peach. I had you figured out from the start, though. I think we can both agree that if my blouse hadn’t fit you so perfectly, I might’ve had to reconsider my conclusions entirely.”

Charlie sighed in defeat.

“I must admit, even I didn’t expect it to suit you *quite* so well. That was a surprise—though an utterly delightful one. Almost feels like Christmas came early, doesn’t it?”

He took a deep breath—he was going to try to salvage what little dignity he had left. Rising from the couch with a determined expression, he steeled himself.

“And where do you think you’re going?” Celeste asked, her tone light but with an unmistakable edge of authority.

“To go change—”

“No, you’re not.” Her eyebrows arched delicately. “May I remind you of your agreement? You agreed to… what was it again?” She paused, feigning thoughtful recollection before her lips curved into a faint smile. “Ah yes, that’s right. You agreed to wear my blouse for the rest of the day. Didn’t you?”

Charlie exhaled heavily, his resolve faltering. Celeste had a way of shifting from warmth to cool command with a swiftness that left him reeling—one moment tender and reassuring, the next, unyielding and immovable. But what startled him most wasn’t her sudden change in tone; it was his own response. Instead of feeling humiliated or defiant, he found himself drawn even closer to her strength, helpless against its pull—like a moth to a flame.

Charlie hadn’t expected things to escalate this quickly—or this definitively. She’d been clear about her expectations, about how sure she was that he wouldn’t let her down. But this? There was no subtlety, no gentle coaxing. Her confidence was unsettling, and he found himself questioning just how well he really knew her.

“I’ll bring you a blouse that I’d like you to wear to school on Monday,” Celeste said calmly, as though they were discussing something mundane. “And the special detergent I use to wash them.”

“What—” he began, but her no-nonsense look silenced him mid-protest.

“You’ll hand-wash the one you’re wearing tonight,” she continued, her tone leaving no room for argument.

Her unwavering authority unnerved him. How could she be so sure? Who was this girl, really? The intensity in her eyes—almost possessive—sent a flicker of unease through him.

Celeste spun on her heels, heading for the stairs. “Oh, and another thing,” she called back over her shoulder. “When you use the bathroom from now on, you’ll sit down like a lady. Got that?”

Charlie stood frozen, his head swimming.

“Yes, Celeste,” he said finally in defeat.

<hr style="height:8px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:blue">







## Not Shirt. Blouse.

Charlie stared pensively at the blouse. The longer he stared at it, the more he realised a case could be made for it simply being a shirt. It was… it was just a shirt. Okay, a bit form-fitting, but just a shirt.

He put it on.

See? Just a shirt.

It was just as aunt Betty entered the room that he noticed the darts.

“Nice shirt! I don’t remember seeing it before. Where did you—” She had noticed the darts. He felt compelled to explain.

“Um, friend of mine…”

“Celeste?” She had that bemused smile women reserve for when they discover someone wearing underwear of the opposite gender, or other quirky behaviours. Charlie merely nodded, at loss for words. “Well, it looks really nice on you, sugar. Were you thinking of wearing it to school today?”

“I don’t have a choice,” he murmured despondently.

“Lose a bet?”

He shrugged. “Something like that.”

“Well, you can’t wear shorts with that top. You’ll need to pair it with jeans, else you’ll just look ridiculous. I can loan you a pair of mine, if you want.”

Charlie couldn’t believe his ears. His aunt wants to loan him a pair of her jeans! She seemed so matter of fact about it, too, like it was the most natural thing in the world for him to be going to school dressed in a girl’s blouse.

“Auntie, I couldn’t—”

What’s the big deal? It’s just a pair of jeans!”

And so it was that Charlie found himself walking slowly to school, filled with a sense of dread he’d never experienced before, clad in Celeste’s blouse and his aunt’s skinny jeans. The garments suited his figure perfectly, but his mind obstinately rebelled against the completely ordinary reality of presenting as a young woman. Celeste caught up with him just as he was walking past the duck pond.

“Nice! That totally works as an outfit. Did your aunt give you her jeans?”

“Loaned. She insisted,” Charlie said glumly. “When I was pulling them on, she said something about how I had ‘filled out’… was the way she put it. Just because the jeans fit, she told me. I did have a bit of a struggle pulling them on.”

“What, like over your bum? Looks nice from where I’m seeing it.”

Charlie ignored her remark. “Celeste, how am I going to survive today? I’ll tell you, I’m terrified!”

“You need to trust me a bit more,” Celeste told him earnestly. “Didn’t I tell you I would protect you? Why can’t you trust me?”

“But Celeste,” he returned with a look of trepidation, “you can’t be with me every minute of the whole day, today, now can you? I just know I’m going to be—”

“You won’t! Stop being such a nervous Nellie. Have a look over there by the front gate, Charlotte.” Celeste pointed at a group of girls gathered at the entrance to the high school grounds. “All my friends! I rang them yesterday and worked out your entire day—you’re going to be with one of us all day today. You’re going to be as safe as ever—we guarantee it. You’re one of us girls, now. No one will mess with you!”

“Hi, Charlotte!”

Charlie’s heart sank. He recognized Lana from the pool. She was the one who’d lent him her bike shorts that first day—and, finally, last week, her bathing suit. He couldn’t be certain, but he was pretty sure it was Lana who’d suggested to Ms. Hamilton that he wear one in the first place.
Her gestures had always seemed so kind, so inclusive. And now here she was—calling him ‘Charlotte,’ and with a little too much glee for his liking.

It felt like he’d been sliding down a slope, one that grew steeper and slicker with every step, until now he was hopelessly caught in this strange web of femininity.
He had the good sense to wave back to Lara, albeit with a bit of a weak smile. Celeste grinned at him.

“That’s your swim class sorted. Lana would bite the head off anyone who tried to lay a hand on you. Of course, I heard the girls in your class all love you anyway.” She giggled at the look of surprise on his face. “Oh, c’mon, you must already know that. Why, even Ms Hamilton thinks you’re a sweetheart.” Charlie blushed furiously—prettily, Celeste thought.
