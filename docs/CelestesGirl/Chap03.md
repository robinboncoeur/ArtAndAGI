## Wrong Allocation Again

Graduation came and went in a blur of handshakes, photographs, and the strange, bright emptiness that follows applause. I kept my smile in place, accepted the honours cord like it belonged to me, and watched the year scatter—boys roaring about the coast, girls already rehearsing their new lives. …Charlie didn’t scatter. He simply... vanished — as if being perceived as a future was more frightening than being ignored as a present. A week later I was at the Faire grounds before dawn, clipboard in hand, my mum’s name on a donor plaque near the gate and my dad’s quiet influence in the way managers returned his calls. Wardrobe had lost two staff to “last-minute opportunities,” which meant it became mine by default—because I’d been hovering near it for years, because I knew the inventory by touch, because I didn’t panic. I was scanning the temporary hire list when I saw *Rossignol, Charles* under Maintenance and felt that small, decisive click in my chest: wrong allocation, again—only this time it was happening on my turf.


## Celeste and Wardrobe

Morning at the Faire wasn’t romantic.

It was the smell of damp canvas and cold metal, the slap of tarps in wind, the low, purposeful swearing of men moving heavy things before the public arrived to call it “charming.” The sun hadn’t properly committed to being up yet, and already the grounds looked like an argument someone had started at midnight and forgotten to finish.

I walked with my clipboard tucked against my ribs and my hair pinned tight, because Wardrobe is chaos unless someone insists it isn’t. People say “costumes” like they mean lace and ribbons. In practice, it’s inventory, repairs, sweat, missing buttons, lost stockings, and the constant terror of a zipper failing five minutes before a guest photo with a patron who paid to be here.

Two staff down, I’d been told cheerfully, as though the universe had simply moved pieces off the board for fun. I hadn’t argued. I’d taken the keys.

That was my advantage, really. Not that my parents’ names were on a plaque by the gate—though that did mean my calls got returned. My advantage was that I didn’t waste energy being offended by reality.

I didn’t stop walking when I heard the raised voice.

“Mate, no—no, not like that. You’re going to tear it. For God’s sake, put it down.”

The voice belonged to Graham — Maintenance lead, forearms like carved timber, the kind of man whose authority didn’t require a title because it was written into how people stepped aside when he moved.

I found them near the prop shed. Two boys hauling benches. One man supervising with the exhausted patience of someone who’d learned the hard way that yelling doesn’t make things lighter.

And there, between a stack of planks and a coil of rope, was Charlie.

He looked worse than he had at school, and not in any dramatic way. Just… worn at the edges. Hair in his eyes, shirt clinging slightly at the collar as if he’d already been sweating, shoulders pulled inward against the weight of a bench he had no business carrying. His hands were placed too carefully — not gripping like a labourer, but holding like someone afraid of damaging the object. He moved as though every step required permission.

He wasn’t failing loudly.

He was failing the way that gets you injured: quietly, stubbornly, determined to be useful even as his body disagreed.

Graham swore under his breath. “You—Rossignol, was it?—you’ve got to *move* with it. You’re thinking too much.”

Charlie nodded like he’d been slapped with a new rule. “Sorry. I’m sorry.”

There it was again. The apology reflex. The same one in bright tiles.

I felt that familiar, cold irritation—not at Charlie, but at the waste of him.

I watched for ten seconds. That’s all you need, if you know what you’re looking at.

He wasn’t lazy. He wasn’t trying to dodge work. He was protecting the bench from scratches while failing to protect his spine. He was allocating his care to the wrong thing because no one had ever taught him where care belongs.

I stepped forward.

“Graham.”

My voice didn’t climb. It didn’t need to. I pitched it the way you pitch a note you expect people to tune to.

He turned, saw me, and his face flickered through a quick sequence: recognition, calculation, resignation. We’d spoken twice since dawn. Both times he’d been pleasantly surprised that I didn’t waste his time.

“Celeste,” he said, and then glanced back at Charlie as if Charlie were a minor disaster he’d been trying to quietly clean up. “He’s new.”

“I can see,” I replied.

Charlie looked up at the sound of my voice and went still.

It wasn’t even conscious. His whole body simply paused, as if some part of him had been waiting for a familiar instruction.

His eyes met mine and something in his expression tightened and brightened all at once — that same struck quality, the sense that my presence rearranged the air around him. It made my stomach do a small, satisfied turn.

Not because I enjoyed being worshipped.

Because it meant he’d listen.

I didn’t smile at him. Not yet. Smiles are currency; you spend them deliberately.

I looked at the bench, then at his hands. “Put it down.”

Charlie hesitated, glancing at Graham as if permission needed to come from the biggest man in the area.

I held Charlie’s gaze. “Now.”

He obeyed. The bench thudded to the ground, and he swayed slightly as the weight left his arms. He tried to hide it. He did a terrible job.

Graham rubbed a hand over his face. “He volunteered for Maintenance. I didn’t—”

“I’m not blaming you,” I said. “I’m reallocating him.”

Graham’s eyebrows rose. “You’re what?”

I turned my clipboard slightly so he could see the roster entry without me having to perform it. *Rossignol, Charles. Maintenance (temp).*

“He’s no use to you,” I said, matter-of-fact. “Not like this.”

“He needs to toughen up,” Graham replied, automatically—then caught himself, because he wasn’t stupid. His eyes flicked to Charlie’s narrow shoulders, to the way Charlie stood as if his bones were negotiable. “Or… he needs a different job.”

“That,” I said, pleased. “Exactly.”

Graham blew out a breath. “Wardrobe’s not exactly a holiday.”

“It’s not about comfort,” I said. “It’s about fit.”

Charlie’s head turned slightly, as if the word had hooked inside him.

Graham tried one last token pushback—because hierarchy demands you don’t hand over a worker without at least performing resistance. “He’s on my list. I’m short too.”

“And I’m down two staff and one catastrophic zipper away from humiliating your donor base,” I replied, bland as milk. “If you want the patrons complaining to your office about ‘lack of authenticity’ because a bodice popped open on the main path, you can keep him.”

Graham stared at me.

Then his mouth twitched. Almost a smile. “You’ve got a tongue on you.”

“I’ve got a job on me,” I corrected.

He looked at Charlie again, weighing him properly now—not as labour, but as risk. “He’s going to hurt himself,” he muttered, as if saying it out loud made it true enough to act on.

“Yes,” I said. “And I don’t like paperwork.”

Graham jerked his chin at Charlie. “Alright. Take him. But if he’s useless—”

“He won’t be,” I said. And because I didn’t do charity, I added, quietly: “Not in my system.”

Charlie’s throat worked. “I—I didn’t ask—”

“I know,” I said, and finally let him have a small smile. Not warm. Not flirtatious. Simply: *you’re safe enough to breathe.*

He looked like he’d been given permission to exist.

I turned and started walking toward the costume rooms without waiting to see if he followed.

He did.

Of course he did.

I heard his footsteps behind me—too careful, too light—matching my pace like an instinct.

After a few metres I said, without turning, “Don’t apologise.”

Silence.

Then, softly: “Okay.”

Good.

We reached the wardrobe door. I pulled the key ring out, selected the right key without looking, and opened it.

“Rule one,” I said, stepping inside. “If you touch a garment, you touch it like it’s alive.”

Charlie paused on the threshold, as if he’d just crossed into a different country.

I glanced over my shoulder at him. “And rule two: if anyone asks why you’re here—”

“You were with me,” he said, very quietly.

I felt the smile return, sharp and private.

“Yes,” I said. “Exactly.”
