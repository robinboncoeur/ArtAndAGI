# Scene 32



## From 25.01.05

Lauren noticed the hair first.

Not because it was *long*—she’d made her peace, long ago, with the fact that her son contained multitudes and that some of them refused to be marched into neat little masculinity. Not because it was *tied*—that, if anything, was an improvement.

She noticed it because it was tied the way you tied something when you had hands that knew what they were doing. Secure. Balanced. No fussy bow. Nothing performative. The knot sat clean at the nape, exactly where it wouldn’t rub, exactly where it wouldn’t pull.

Lauren had done that knot on a thousand mornings for a child who’d never asked for it, and had secretly loved her for doing it anyway.

Her gaze slid down and took in the rest with the clinical affection of a mother who had learned to look without flinching at truth.

Charli’s shirt was ironed—someone else’s iron, she suspected, because the sleeves sat too neatly for him to have done it with his usual “good enough” impatience. His jeans were clean. His shoes were… acceptable. His hands, when he lifted them to take a roll of tape from the bench, were scrubbed in the way you scrub when you’ve been made accountable to a standard.

He looked better.

Not pretty. Not polished. Just *better.*

And the thing that hit Lauren hardest was that he looked better in the quiet way a person looks better when someone has finally expected something of them and meant it.

It wasn’t effort for attention.

It was effort for belonging.

She watched him for a minute without interrupting—watched the way he moved through the room like a support beam that had learned to stop apologising for holding up the ceiling. He was checking a hem, logging a note, sliding a finished piece into a labelled tote with care that wasn’t sentimental. No flourish. No “look at me.”

Infrastructure. Always infrastructure.

Lauren had spent years trying to explain to well-meaning teachers and smug relatives that her son wasn’t lazy. He wasn’t defiant. He just didn’t do “performance.” He did *systems.* He did the boring work that made other people’s shining possible.

The world loved the shining and treated the boring as if it were optional.

Wardrobe, for all its strangeness, looked like it had finally given him the one thing he’d never had: a place where boring was sacred.

She turned and found Celeste at the cutting table, head bent over paper, pencil in hand. The girl’s posture was all decision. All control. Not harsh, not cruel—simply uninterested in chaos. Celeste looked up at Lauren as if she’d already clocked her presence and had been allowing the room to keep moving while she waited to engage.

That alone made Lauren like her more.

No social scrambling. No insecurity acting as politeness. Just—*present.*

Lauren’s eyes flicked, almost without permission, to Charli’s hair again and then back to Celeste’s face.

Ah.

So that was it.

Lauren didn’t *smile* at the thought. She kept her expression neutral, the way you did when you’d discovered a key piece of information and didn’t want the room to see you pocket it.

But internally: **good.**

Not because she wanted her son “matched up” like a doll. Not because she wanted romance as a distraction prize.

Because Lauren had seen what happened to boys like Charli when no one claimed their goodness properly. They drifted. They got hired for their hands and ignored for their minds. They got taken for granted by louder people. They ended up with women who wanted a doormat or men who wanted a servant.

Celeste didn’t want a doormat.

Celeste wanted competence.

And Celeste, Lauren could see even from here, had a very specific way of looking at Charli—an attention that wasn’t hungry, wasn’t mocking, wasn’t “isn’t this fascinating.”

It was recognitional.

Lauren’s throat tightened, unexpectedly.

She waited until the rush of the room eased—the girls moving to another station, Mara disappearing into the back with a ledger and that expression that said *no one is going to die on my watch, but some of you may suffer.*

Then Lauren drifted toward her son.

She didn’t call his name from across the room. That was for people who needed to be noticed.

She walked up beside him and spoke in a voice only he would hear.

“Hi,” she said.

Charli startled, because he always startled when affection arrived quietly. He turned, and his face did that immediate shift—from composed worker to boy, for half a second—and then he steadied.

“Mum,” he said, warmth and caution braided together. “You didn’t say you were coming.”

“I didn’t know I was,” Lauren replied. “I had a minute. I used it.”

He nodded, as if that logic made sense in his world. “Okay.”

Lauren looked at the garment in his hands, then at the notes clipped to it. She didn’t pretend she understood the technicalities. She understood the posture of someone who mattered.

“You look… more like yourself,” she said.

Charli blinked. “Do I?”

“Yes,” she said simply. “More solid.”

He didn’t know what to do with that. Praise made him awkward. He’d been trained by life to suspect compliments were an entry fee, that you’d have to pay them back with performance.

Lauren let the moment sit. Then she tipped her chin toward the tie at his nape.

“Your hair,” she said.

Charli lifted a hand toward it, reflexive. “Oh. Yeah. It was… getting in the way.”

Lauren kept her tone light. “I can see that.”

He hesitated. “Celeste—” he started, and then stopped, as if saying her name out loud might be too revealing.

Lauren waited. She didn’t pounce. She didn’t tease. She’d learned that jokes were knives when your child was sensitive.

“She… helped,” he finished, quietly.

Lauren nodded once, as if that was merely a practical detail. Internally, she filed it under **confirmed.**

“That was kind,” Lauren said aloud.

Charli’s eyes flicked toward Celeste without him meaning them to. He looked away again quickly, embarrassed by his own reflexes.

Lauren watched that tiny movement with a tenderness that made her want to put her hand on his cheek, but she didn’t. He was eighteen, and touch wasn’t something you demanded from a young person who’d spent his whole life trying not to be “too much.”

Instead, she leaned her hip against the edge of the bench, casual.

“I’m going to say something,” she began, “and I need you not to hear it as criticism.”

Charli stiffened slightly. “Okay.”

Lauren exhaled through her nose. How to do this without sounding like she was suddenly trying to remodel him.

How to do this the way you spoke to a daughter who was clever and capable and utterly uninterested in her own presentation—except presentation *mattered* when your life depended on being taken seriously.

Lauren looked at his hands again. Clean, but dry at the knuckles. She looked at his mouth. Fine, but… boys never realised how much first impressions lived there. She looked at his shirt collar. A little rumpled at the edge.

A thousand small, fixable things. Not to make him “better.” To make him *seen* correctly.

“Charli,” she said, quietly. “You have stopped trying to impress people by doing grand gestures. I’m proud of you for that.”

He frowned slightly, unsure. “I didn’t—”

“I know,” Lauren said. “Listen.”

He fell silent.

“You do the work,” Lauren continued. “You do the infrastructure. You make other people’s lives easier in ways you don’t even think to mention. That is your gift.”

Charli’s gaze dropped. He didn’t deny it, but he didn’t claim it either. Claiming still felt like arrogance to him.

Lauren tilted her head, the way she did when she needed him to stay with her.

“But,” she added, carefully, “there’s a difference between being modest and being careless. And you… have a habit of letting ‘I don’t care’ be mistaken for ‘I don’t respect myself.’”

Charli’s eyes lifted, startled. “I do respect—”

“I know you do,” Lauren cut in, gently but firmly. “You respect other people beautifully. I’m talking about what you signal to the world. You signal ‘don’t look too closely at me.’ And sometimes that’s a shield. But sometimes it becomes a habit.”

He swallowed. The words landed. Not as an attack. As a diagnosis.

Lauren softened her voice.

“You’re in a room now with women who notice details,” she said. “Not in a cruel way. In a competent way. They notice because it keeps people safe. Because it makes things work.”

Charli glanced around the studio—at the pinned patterns, the neat shelves, the labelled drawers.

“Yes,” he murmured.

Lauren nodded. “One of those women… notices you.”

Charli went very still.

“Mum,” he whispered, as if the air itself had ears.

Lauren kept her eyes on his, steady and unembarrassed.

“I’m not prying,” she said. “I’m telling you something you need to hear.”

His throat bobbed. “Okay.”

Lauren let a small pause settle, then continued in the most practical tone she could manage, because practicality made this safe for him.

“If you want something meaningful with a woman who has standards,” Lauren said, “you don’t have to become someone else. You don’t have to buy fancy things. You don’t have to play a role.”

Charli’s shoulders eased a fraction, grateful.

“But you do need to meet her world halfway,” Lauren added. “Not with money. With care.”

He blinked. “Care?”

Lauren nodded. “Basic care. The stuff you’re good at giving other people. You need to give it to yourself.”

Charli looked down, as if picturing himself as a checklist. He liked checklists. They made the universe manageable.

Lauren continued, gentle but unyielding:

“Daily shower, yes. But also deodorant. Every day. Not when you remember.”

Charli’s cheeks coloured faintly. “I do.”

Lauren lifted a brow. “You do sometimes. I mean *every day.* Like you brush your teeth.”

He held her gaze, chastened. “Okay.”

Lauren didn’t gloat. She moved on.

“Moisturiser,” she said.

Charli blinked. “What?”

Lauren kept her tone matter-of-fact, as if she’d said “pay the power bill.”

“Your hands are dry,” she said. “Your face, too. Dry skin reads as stress and neglect. A simple moisturiser after your shower. That’s it. Not expensive. Not scented. Just… care.”

He stared at her, processing. “Does that… matter?”

Lauren almost laughed, but she didn’t. She chose honesty.

“It matters to women who live in their bodies,” she said. “Women notice whether you treat your own body like a tool you throw in a drawer, or like something you maintain.”

Charli’s eyes flickered with discomfort—then curiosity. Practical curiosity. The kind that made him learn.

Lauren nodded, encouraged.

“Oral hygiene,” she said next.

Charli opened his mouth, offended. “I brush—”

“Twice a day,” Lauren said. “And floss. I am not negotiating with you on this.”

His shoulders slumped. “Floss is annoying.”

Lauren’s voice turned dry. “So is dental work.”

Charli exhaled, half a laugh. “Okay.”

Lauren wasn’t finished.

“Clean clothes,” she said, ticking points off on invisible fingers. “Not just ‘not dirty.’ Clean. And if something’s wrinkled, you sort it. You don’t shrug and hope the world won’t notice.”

He looked down at his shirt. “It’s fine.”

Lauren’s expression softened, but her eyes stayed sharp.

“Charli,” she said, “you are not a scruffy boy anymore. You are a young adult in a professional environment. And if you are standing near a woman like Celeste—”

He flinched at her saying the name so plainly.

Lauren continued anyway.

“—then the simplest thing you can do, to show you’re serious, is to look like you respect her standards.”

Charli’s mouth worked, then he nodded slowly.

Lauren watched him and felt that familiar ache: her son didn’t crave attention, but he craved *permission*—permission to believe he could be wanted without proving his worth through suffering.

Lauren softened again.

“This isn’t about ‘getting’ her,” she said quietly. “I don’t like that language. This is about making it easier for her to choose you openly, without having to justify it to herself.”

Charli went silent.

Lauren leaned in slightly, voice lower.

“And I saw something today,” she added, carefully. “I saw her tie your hair.”

Charli’s eyes widened. “You saw that?”

Lauren nodded once. “I did.”

His cheeks warmed again, but there was a brightness under it now—hope that didn’t look like desperation. Hope that looked like a door opening.

Lauren held that hope gently, like a fragile instrument.

“She didn’t do that for nothing,” Lauren said. “Women like Celeste don’t do casual care.”

Charli’s breath caught. He looked toward Celeste again without meaning to, then back to his mother.

Lauren’s voice gentled into something almost like a lullaby, except it wasn’t soft. It was firm, loving, and practical.

“So,” she said, “if you want to honour what she offered—if you want to step into that space with integrity—then you meet her with the basics.”

Charli nodded again, slower. “Okay.”

Lauren tilted her head. “Do you want a list?”

He blinked, then something in him relaxed, because a list meant he could succeed.

“Yes,” he said. “Please.”

Lauren smiled then—small, satisfied.

“Right,” she said. “Here’s your boring little maintenance plan.”

She ticked them off, one by one, as if she were training him for a sport.

“Morning: brush teeth, deodorant, clean shirt. Evening: brush teeth again. Floss. Shower. Moisturiser after.”

He stared at her. “That’s… a lot.”

Lauren snorted softly. “It’s not a lot. It’s the minimum. You’ve simply been living like the minimum is optional.”

He looked sheepish. “Okay.”

“And hair,” Lauren added, glancing at the neat tie again. “You don’t need anything fancy. But you keep it tidy. You learn two ways to tie it so it doesn’t look like you wrestled a windstorm and lost.”

Charli’s mouth twitched.

Lauren’s eyes softened.

“You’re allowed to look cared for,” she said. “You’re allowed to look like you belong near someone with standards.”

Charli swallowed hard. “Mum…”

Lauren held his gaze, steady.

“I know you,” she said. “And I know you’re at your best when you’re building something that lasts.”

His eyes flicked down, then back up. “I want… something that lasts.”

Lauren’s chest tightened. She nodded, once.

“Then stop treating yourself like you’re temporary,” she said.

Charli went still.

For a moment, he looked younger—like a boy hearing, for the first time, that self-care wasn’t vanity. That it was a kind of respect.

Then he breathed out.

“Okay,” he said, quietly. “I can do that.”

Lauren smiled again, the kind of smile that was both pride and warning.

“Good,” she said. “Because if you turn up to a woman like Celeste with your heart in your hands and toothpaste on your collar…”

He let out a small sound of horror. “I don’t—”

Lauren raised her brows. “You do.”

He covered his face with one hand, mortified. “Oh my god.”

Lauren patted his arm once—brief, affectionate, permission-giving.

“Fixable,” she said.

Charli lowered his hand, still red-faced, but smiling now too, properly this time.

“Fixable,” he echoed.

Lauren straightened, scanning the room again. Celeste was still working, still composed, still making the world make sense.

Lauren felt a surge of something fierce and grateful.

Yes.

This girl would not swallow her son and call it love.

This girl would expect him to grow.

Lauren glanced back at Charli.

“And one more thing,” she added.

He looked at her, attentive.

Lauren’s voice turned very calm.

“If you are hoping,” she said, “you do not sabotage yourself by pretending you don’t.”

Charli swallowed. “Okay.”

Lauren nodded once, satisfied.

“Good boy,” she said, and meant it not as infantilisation but as acknowledgement: *you’re doing the right thing.*

Charli’s eyes softened. He nodded.

Lauren pushed off the bench, collected her tote, and turned as if she were about to leave—because that was also part of how you raised someone like Charli. You gave them the tools, then you trusted them to use them.

At the last second, she paused and glanced back at him.

“And Charli?” she said.

He looked up.

Lauren’s mouth curved, faintly.

“Ask Celeste what moisturiser she uses,” she said. “Not because you need her to mother you. Because it tells her you heard the standards.”

Charli blinked, then let out a breathy laugh, incredulous.

“That’s… cheeky.”

Lauren’s eyes warmed. “It’s practical.”

He nodded slowly, like he was already picturing the conversation and realising it wasn’t terrifying; it was simply another system to learn.

Lauren turned away then, and as she walked past Celeste, she didn’t stop. She didn’t interfere.

She only met the girl’s eyes briefly and gave her the smallest nod—a quiet mother-to-woman acknowledgement that said:

*I see you. I see what you’re building. And I approve of standards.*

Then she left the room as quietly as she’d arrived, letting the machine continue its cycle—only now, with one more bolt tightened into place.
