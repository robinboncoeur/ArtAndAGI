# Scene 35



## From 25.01.05

Celeste didn’t call it a crisis.

She called it a **return**.

That was the thing about having a line that people actually wanted: nothing was ever “finished.” It was only ever shipped, worn, reported on, and then quietly revised by whoever still had enough integrity to care what happened *after* the invoice cleared.

The museum’s email had arrived just after lunch, subject line blunt in the way institutional clients got when they felt entitled to bluntness:

**NYMPH LINE — FIT / WEAR ISSUE (REPRODUCIBLE)**

Mara printed it without comment and pinned it to the board under *RETURNS / FIELD NOTES* like it was a specimen.

Then she said, flatly, “Back to prototyping.”

No sigh. No melodrama. No martyr-maths.

Just: the machine changes shape and keeps moving.

The part that made Celeste’s teeth grind wasn’t the critique. Critique was data. The part that made her angry was that the “Nymph” line had been Wardrobe’s quiet triumph—simple, wearable, visually clean, a design that made clients feel like they’d stepped into a world without looking like a costume-shop joke.

It was *supposed* to be the line you didn’t have to defend.

The report was specific. That’s what made it useful.

A repeated stress point at the upper back under sustained reach. Tightness after hours. A seam rolling and becoming noticeable in motion. A neckline shifting when the wearer bent forward.

Real wear. Real bodies. Real day.

Mara read the email once, then slid it across to Charli without looking at him.

“Tester,” she said.

Charli took it the way she took everything now: not as a spotlight, but as a responsibility.

“Okay,” she said, and went to change.

Celeste stayed at the cutting table and made herself breathe like a person who was in charge of her own nervous system.

Because the Nymph line had become *the* line.

Not just the Faire. Not just the museum. Other clients had begun circling it like sharks. “Inspired by,” “adjacent to,” “something similar but more our brand.” Emails stacking up with polite urgency.

Wardrobe was no longer proving viability. It was proving scale.

And scale only worked if you didn’t let success turn you sloppy.

Charli returned ten minutes later, and the room did what it always did around her now—shifted, recalibrated, treated her like a moving part that mattered.

She was in the outfit.

Deep blue gown, fitted bodice, square neckline softened by the white of the shift. A white apron tied firmly at the waist, not precious, not performative. Sleeves rolled back to show the cuff—practical, ready for work. The skirt moved cleanly at her ankles. The silhouette did what it was designed to do: **read era** without reading parody.

The whole thing looked… oddly inevitable on him, the way a uniform looks inevitable on someone who finally belongs in the building.

That thought came with a small sting. Celeste bit it down.

Don’t romanticise. Log.

Charli crossed the room with the wear-test sheet already in her hand. She lifted her arms, reached overhead, turned her shoulders. The gown responded. She frowned, noted something, moved again. She didn’t preen. She didn’t act embarrassed. She acted like a person testing a hinge.

Mara watched her for half a second—eyes scanning seam lines the way other people scanned faces—then turned back to her ledger as if that half-second had been enough to evaluate the entire world.

“Six hours,” Mara said. “Minimum. Movement. Bending. Lifting. No babying.”

Charli nodded. “Got it.”

Celeste kept her eyes on the cutting table, on the pattern weights, on the pencil in her hand. She refused to stare, because she refused to become the kind of woman who pretended she wasn’t watching while watching anyway.

The day resumed. Machines. Thread. Scissors. The low murmur of competent women speaking in shorthand.

Charli moved among them, in blue and white, completely untheatrical. She carried boxes. She reached for shelves. She bent to pick up dropped pins. She slid a tote across a table with a careful shove of her hip so her hands stayed clean. The gown shifted and settled and proved its integrity with every motion.

And, annoyingly—because the world had a sense of humour—he made it look *better* simply by doing honest work in it.

Halfway through the afternoon, Sarah wandered in from finishing with a bundle of linen ties over one arm and her usual expression of amused contempt for anything that tried too hard.

She took one look at Charli, then clicked her tongue.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, voice pure UK bite, “you can’t be wandering about like that with your hair flopping all over the place.”

Charli froze mid-note, pen hovering. “It’s… tied.”

Sarah tilted her head and made a noise like she was tasting something unimpressive.

“It’s tied like you’ve escaped from a gale,” she said. “Not tied like you belong in that frock.”

One of the stitchers snorted. Another girl hid a smile behind a spool rack.

Charli’s cheeks warmed—just a shade—but she didn’t bristle. That was new. She could take pressure without turning it into shame.

Celeste kept cutting, expression neutral. Inside, she catalogued Sarah’s behaviour as what it was: a culture test.

Sarah didn’t flirt. Sarah didn’t “tease” as foreplay. Sarah pressure-tested standards the way she pressure-tested seams—sharp, funny, occasionally brutal, and oddly loyal to the outcome.

Charli glanced at Celeste as if asking, silently, *Is this allowed?*

Celeste didn’t rescue him. She didn’t need rescuing. She simply stated the rule.

“Comments about the tester’s body are out,” she said, without looking up. “Comments about function are in.”

Sarah put a hand to her chest with mock offence.

“Function, darling,” she said. “That hair in her face is contamination and chaos.”

Celeste’s pencil paused. That was… technically correct.

Charli looked down at her sheet again, visibly relieved to have the criticism framed as *work* rather than *him.*

“I tried earlier,” she admitted, almost apologetically. “It… came loose.”

Sarah waved a dismissive hand.

“Of course it did,” she said. “You’ve tied it like a boy who’s never had to keep anything neat for longer than five minutes.”

The room went quiet for a fraction of a second, the air prickling with potential misstep.

Celeste lifted her gaze then, calm and direct.

“Language,” she said.

Sarah blinked, then—credit where it was due—she corrected herself instantly.

“Fine,” Sarah said. “Like a person who hasn’t had practice.”

That was why Sarah survived in this room. She was spiky, but she was corrigible.

Charli swallowed, then nodded slowly. “Okay.”

Sarah held out one of the linen ties, dangling it like a challenge. “Do it properly, then.”

Charli took it and moved to the mirror by the fitting corner. She lifted her hands to her hair, tried to gather it back. His fingers fumbled. The tie twisted. A section slipped forward again. She tried to loop it once, missed the anchor point, and the whole thing loosened in her hands.

She stared at her own reflection like it had betrayed him.

Sarah watched with the sort of delighted pity only Sarah could weaponise.

“Lord,” she murmured. “You’re hopeless.”

Charli made a small sound—half laugh, half mortification.

Celeste felt something in her chest tighten.

Not protective professionalism.

Something softer. Something more dangerous because it wanted to be *personal.*

She put her pencil down.

Crossed the room with steady steps.

Stopped behind him.

And because she was not sloppy, not even now, she said:

“May I?”

Charli’s eyes flicked up in the mirror. She looked startled—then relieved, as if the question itself had steadied him.

“Yes,” she said.

Celeste took the tie from her hands, not snatching—receiving it like a tool. She gathered her hair in one clean motion, fingers firm but gentle at the nape. She could feel the tension in her shoulders, the instinct to hold himself rigid, to not be “in the way.”

She corrected that with the same brisk competence she used on fabric.

“Relax your shoulders,” she said. “You’re fighting your own head.”

Charli exhaled, and her shoulders dropped a fraction.

Better.

Celeste’s hands moved with practiced logic: gather, smooth, secure. She didn’t yank. She didn’t indulge. She didn’t make a ceremony of it. She simply tied her into the silhouette the garment wanted—tidy, controlled, finished.

In the mirror, the effect was immediate.

The gown stopped reading as “someone wearing a dress for testing” and started reading as **a complete look**—period-appropriate, intentional, composed. The neckline sat better without loose strands tugging at the shift. The line of the bodice looked sharper because the head and neck were now clean.

Finish.

Sarah let out a low whistle.

“Oh,” she said, grudging. “There we go. Now you look like you’re meant to be in it.”

Celeste’s throat tightened at the phrasing—*meant to be*—but she didn’t show it.

She checked the tie with one small tug to ensure it would hold through movement. Then she stepped back immediately, hands away, space restored.

“Done,” she said, as if she’d tightened a strap.

Charli stared at himself in the mirror for a second too long.

She didn’t look delighted in a vain way. She looked… steadied. As if the world had stopped snagging on him.

She turned her head slightly, testing. The tie held. No loose hair in her eyes. No constant small irritation.

She looked at Celeste, and her voice came out quiet.

“Thanks.”

Celeste nodded once. “Log any discomfort at the nape after a few hours. If it pulls, we adjust.”

Charli blinked, then smiled—small, grateful. “Okay.”

Sarah rolled her eyes dramatically, but there was warmth in it.

“Listen to her,” she said. “She’s frighteningly correct.”

Celeste’s mouth twitched, despite herself.

“Back to work,” she said.

Charli returned to her wear-test with a new steadiness. She moved more freely. She lifted and bent and carried, and the gown—now properly “finished”—moved with her like it had always known her body.

Celeste watched her for two beats longer than necessary, then forced herself back to the cutting table.

And, as always, she ran the check. Fast. Clinical.

**Did that make her smaller?**

No.

It made her *more functional.* More comfortable. Less distracted.

It made the garment test cleaner. It made the room safer.

And if it also made something inside Celeste warm and hungry and strangely proud—well.

That part was hers to manage.

Later, when Charli passed her station with her sheet updated—two new notes, precise, written in her careful hand—Celeste glanced at the top line and felt satisfaction spark like a match.

**Nymph Line — re-test, hair secured; neckline stability improved; upper-back stress persists under sustained reach.**

Data. Progress. Standards held.

Charli paused as if to ask something, then didn’t. She just nodded at her and moved on, hair still neat, posture still steady.

Celeste watched her go and thought, with a kind of quiet inevitability that made her chest ache:

You can build a person without taking them apart.

You can lead without exploiting.

You can be tender and still be in control.

And if the gown looked more complete once her hair was up—if the whole silhouette finally snapped into place—Celeste couldn’t pretend she hadn’t felt the same thing happen inside her.

A finish.

Not in the cheap way.

In the right way.

A world aligning around something that had always been true and was simply—at last—being done properly.

---

If you want to push this one tiny click further (still clean): later that day, Celeste notices Charli *reties it himself* after it loosens slightly—same knot, same placement—without asking. That’s the “he carries the standard forward” proof, and it’ll make her attraction spike in a way that reads earned, not scripted.

## Hair

Charli started for the mirror again.

Not because it was truly failing—Celeste could see from across the room that the tie still held. The nape was still secure. The neckline was still stable. The gown still read era, still read intentional.

But a few tendrils had escaped—soft little wisps at her ears, a strand near her cheekbone that moved when she turned her head.

Normal.

Living.

And Charli’s body, newly trained to care, had mistaken “normal” for “wrong.”

Sarah clocked the movement instantly.

“Oh, don’t you *dare*,” she said, as if she were scolding a kettle for boiling.

Charli froze mid-step, hand half-raised. “It’s… coming loose.”

Sarah’s face did that particular UK expression—half disbelief, half comedy, all judgement.

“Sweetheart,” she said, “if you stop what you’re doing every time a strand escapes, you’ll spend your entire life in front of a mirror. You’ll die there. Surrounded by hair ties.”

A couple of the stitchers snorted. One of them murmured something like *she’s not wrong* without looking up.

Charli’s cheeks coloured, but she didn’t shrink. She looked genuinely uncertain, like she’d been told to do a thing and now didn’t know when to stop doing it.

“It looks messy,” she said, quietly.

Sarah made a dismissive wave, as if sweeping the entire concept off a table.

“It looks *human*,” she said. “Girls learn this when they’re four. You don’t halt the world for tendrils. Tendrils are background noise. They’re weather.”

Charli blinked at her, processing.

Sarah continued, warming to the lecture in the way she did when she’d found a point she could sharpen for the good of the room.

“Tangles are the enemy,” she said. “Hair in your eyes is the enemy. Hair snagging your shift is the enemy. But a wisp by the ear? That’s nothing. You ignore it and carry on. The point is to work, not to curate.”

Charli’s hand lowered slowly, like someone receiving permission she hadn’t realised she needed.

Celeste, at the cutting table, didn’t look up at first. She didn’t want to dignify this with too much attention. The goal was normalisation.

But she did speak, voice steady, calm, and with just enough authority to turn Sarah’s humour into policy.

“Sarah’s right,” she said. “We do triage here.”

Charli’s gaze flicked to her.

Celeste finally looked up then—briefly, precisely—and her eyes went not to Charli's face but to the garment’s line: neckline stable, bodice clean, apron tie holding.

“If you’re going to stop work,” Celeste added, “let it be for a seam that fails—not for a strand that exists.”

There was a beat of quiet.

Then Charli exhaled. Not a laugh, not a sigh—an internal reset.

“Okay,” she said.

Sarah pointed at her like she’d just signed off on a trainee.

“Good,” she said. “Now go be useful.”

Charli turned away from the mirror and went back to her station.

And Celeste watched—only for the space of a breath—as she moved with a little more ease, a little less self-monitoring. The hair stayed mostly tidy, with a few soft wisps that made her look less like a mannequin and more like a person doing real work in real clothes.

Which, Celeste realised with a small, private flare of warmth, was exactly the point.
