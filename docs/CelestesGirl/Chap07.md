## Celeste — The Non-Event

## Celeste — Phase 2 (Shadow and Shield)

The donor path was a different climate.

Not louder—just more entitled.

People walked slowly here, as if speed were something other people did for them. They held their cups like props. They smiled too widely at anything in costume, as if the illusion existed to bless their afternoon.

I kept my pace unhurried and my face neutral, because donors can smell eagerness the way dogs smell fear.

Charlie walked half a step behind my right shoulder, exactly where I’d placed him. Not crowding. Not lagging. Present without insisting on being perceived.

His kit pouch sat at his hip; his hand rested lightly on it now and then, as if reassuring himself that he had tools and therefore purpose. The uniform had done what uniforms are meant to do: it had given him a role to inhabit without commentary.

That mattered.

We passed the morning tea setup—linen cloths, a vase of flowers trying too hard, the committee members in modern clothes hovering at the edges with the strained expressions of people who had organised something and now feared it might happen.

A woman in pearls intercepted me with a smile that was meant to be charming.

“Celeste!” she said brightly, as though we were old friends. “Darling, we’re *so* pleased you could—”

She wasn’t one of my mother’s friends. Not really. She was an acquaintance of the donor circle: a person who existed to congratulate herself for knowing people who did things.

I returned a smile just polite enough to be uninteresting. “Good morning.”

“Oh, you look divine,” she continued. “So authentic. I just adore what you’ve done with the place. It’s like stepping back in time, isn’t it?”

I nodded once. Non-committal.

“And who is this?” Her gaze slid to Charlie, curious and appraising, already seeking a story to tell later.

Charlie’s shoulders stiffened almost imperceptibly. I felt it beside me like a change in temperature.

This was the moment.

Not dramatic. Not cruel. Just the ordinary social reach that turns people into objects if you let it.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t rescue him immediately. I let the test exist.

Charlie inhaled, and I saw the old reflex try to rise—apology, explanation, the urge to make himself safe by making himself small.

Then—beautifully—he caught it.

He looked at the woman, steady enough.

“I’m Wardrobe support,” he said, clearly. “Talk to Celeste.”

The sentence landed like a closed door.

The woman blinked, smile still pasted on, suddenly missing the expected opening. “Oh!”

I watched her recalibrate. Donor women hate being told “no” in a way that doesn’t look like no.

“Well,” she said, recovering, “how efficient.”

Charlie didn’t smile. He didn’t flinch. He didn’t elaborate. He simply shifted his gaze back toward the path ahead, as if the conversation had already returned to its proper owner.

I felt something in my chest click into place—not warmth, exactly. Satisfaction. Relief at a system working.

“Thank you,” the woman said to me, because she had to put her words somewhere. “I’ll let you get on. Busy day!”

“Yes,” I agreed.

She drifted away, already looking for someone else to talk at.

I didn’t look at Charlie immediately. If I praised him too openly, he’d start performing for praise. I wanted him performing for standards.

We walked a few paces before I spoke.

“Good,” I said.

Charlie’s eyes flicked to mine for half a second, startled by the acknowledgement. Then he looked forward again, as though he didn’t trust himself to hold it.

“You didn’t apologise,” I added.

His throat bobbed. “I almost did.”

“But you didn’t.”

He nodded once, a small, contained victory.

A man in a blazer—no costume, but a lanyard and the self-assured posture of someone who assumed access—stepped in front of me next.

“Excuse me,” he said, smile sharpened to something managerial. “I wanted to ask—who’s responsible for the signage? It’s a bit… confusing. I’m trying to find the cooperage demonstration.”

I recognised him: one of the “friends of the Faire” committee men, the kind who did not volunteer so much as supervise. The kind who believed his opinions were helpful by virtue of existing.

“I’m responsible for Wardrobe,” I said, pleasant. “Signage is not my domain.”

“Oh, but surely you can direct me,” he insisted, leaning slightly forward as if proximity were authority. “It’s all connected, isn’t it?”

I watched him attempt to draw me into a conversation that would swallow ten minutes and deliver nothing.

This, too, was a test—not for Charlie, but for my own restraint.

Before I could respond, Charlie moved.

Not stepping in front of me. Not being dramatic. Simply angling his body slightly so he became a gentle interruption between the man’s trajectory and mine.

He didn’t touch. He didn’t crowd. He just… occupied space with purpose.

“I can point you,” Charlie said, voice quiet but clear. “Cooperage is past the bakery stall. Second left after the apothecary cart.”

The man blinked. Committee men hate being efficiently handled by people they haven’t categorised.

He gave Charlie a quick look, then turned back to me, looking for permission to accept the answer.

I gave him nothing but calm. “That’s correct.”

“Well,” he said stiffly, “thank you.”

He walked away, not quite sure what had happened.

Charlie returned to my shoulder position without being told.

I kept walking.

It wasn’t until we’d passed out of earshot that I spoke again.

“You knew that,” I said.

Charlie nodded. “I walked past it earlier when Graham was shouting at the benches.”

“Good,” I said. “You observed.”

He hesitated, then asked, careful, “Was that… okay?”

It wasn’t quite an apology. It was a check-in. A healthy one.

I glanced at him. “It was useful.”

His shoulders loosened slightly, as if “useful” were a kind of permission he understood.

We continued along the path.

People looked at us. Of course they did. They looked at clothing and assumed it contained a story. They looked at a young man in period kit and tried to decide if it was charming or funny or strange or something they could buy with a comment.

Charlie didn’t give them anything to buy.

He walked like a worker. He held his posture like a tool. He kept his face neutral.

And because he did, the gaze slid off him. Not entirely—nothing makes you invisible to everyone—but enough that the wrong kind of attention failed to stick.

That was the point.

We reached the morning tea area again, where a small cluster had formed—two women, a man, my mother’s friend Lisette, all in the slow orbit of donor conversation.

Lisette caught my eye and smiled. “Celeste! Darling. Everything alright?”

I answered with the truth that mattered. “Everything is contained.”

Her smile softened with approval. Lisette respected competence.

Then her gaze flicked to Charlie and her expression became—just for a second—questioning. Not prurient. Not mocking. Simply: *who is this and why is he with you?*

This was the real pivot point. The subtle one.

I could have said, “He’s helping.” I could have given a little story. I could have made it cute.

I didn’t.

I said the simplest thing in the world.

“He’s with Wardrobe,” I told her.

It framed him as function. It framed him as part of the machine, not a spectacle.

Lisette nodded as if that explained everything it needed to explain. “Ah.”

I kept walking.

Charlie kept pace.

A minute later, without looking at him, I said, “You did well.”

He inhaled sharply, as if the words had surprised him by being real.

“Thank you,” he said—then stopped, caught himself, and didn’t add anything else.

Good.

As we moved toward the next problem on my list, I realised something with a clarity that annoyed me, because I didn’t like noticing dependencies too early.

It wasn’t that Charlie obeyed.

It was that he *reduced friction.*

He absorbed people who would otherwise cling to me. He redirected questions without turning them into drama. He took social weight and made it lighter—quietly, without demanding recognition for it.

That was rare.

And rarity, in a system like mine, becomes value.

Not sentimental value.

Operational value.

I glanced at him—just once—and found him watching the path ahead with that careful attentiveness, as if the world were a series of small failures he could prevent if he stayed alert.

He wasn’t looking for applause.

He was looking for what I would need next.

And that—more than any garment—was the first true shape of “companion” taking form.
