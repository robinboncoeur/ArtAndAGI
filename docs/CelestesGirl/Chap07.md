## Celeste — The Non-Event

## Celeste — Phase 2 (Shadow and Shield)

The donor path was a different climate.

Not louder—just more entitled.

People walked slowly here, as if speed were something other people did for them. They held their cups like props. They smiled too widely at anything in costume, as if the illusion existed to bless their afternoon.

I kept my pace unhurried and my face neutral, because donors can smell eagerness the way dogs smell fear.

Charlie walked half a step behind my right shoulder, exactly where I’d placed him. Not crowding. Not lagging. Present without insisting on being perceived.

His kit pouch sat at his hip; his hand rested lightly on it now and then, as if reassuring himself that he had tools and therefore purpose. The uniform had done what uniforms are meant to do: it had given him a role to inhabit without commentary.

That mattered.

We passed the morning tea setup—linen cloths, a vase of flowers trying too hard, the committee members in modern clothes hovering at the edges with the strained expressions of people who had organised something and now feared it might happen.

A woman in pearls intercepted me with a smile that was meant to be charming.

“Celeste!” she said brightly, as though we were old friends. “Darling, we’re *so* pleased you could—”

She wasn’t one of my mother’s friends. Not really. She was an acquaintance of the donor circle: a person who existed to congratulate herself for knowing people who did things.

I returned a smile just polite enough to be uninteresting. “Good morning.”

“Oh, you look divine,” she continued. “So authentic. I just adore what you’ve done with the place. It’s like stepping back in time, isn’t it?”

I nodded once. Non-committal.

“And who is this?” Her gaze slid to Charlie, curious and appraising, already seeking a story to tell later.

Charlie’s shoulders stiffened almost imperceptibly. I felt it beside me like a change in temperature.

This was the moment.

Not dramatic. Not cruel. Just the ordinary social reach that turns people into objects if you let it.

I didn’t answer. I didn’t rescue him immediately. I let the test exist.

Charlie inhaled, and I saw the old reflex try to rise—apology, explanation, the urge to make himself safe by making himself small.

Then—beautifully—he caught it.

He looked at the woman, steady enough.

“I’m Wardrobe support,” he said, clearly. “Talk to Celeste.”

The sentence landed like a closed door.

The woman blinked, smile still pasted on, suddenly missing the expected opening. “Oh!”

I watched her recalibrate. Donor women hate being told “no” in a way that doesn’t look like no.

“Well,” she said, recovering, “how efficient.”

Charlie didn’t smile. He didn’t flinch. He didn’t elaborate. He simply shifted his gaze back toward the path ahead, as if the conversation had already returned to its proper owner.

I felt something in my chest click into place—not warmth, exactly. Satisfaction. Relief at a system working.

“Thank you,” the woman said to me, because she had to put her words somewhere. “I’ll let you get on. Busy day!”

“Yes,” I agreed.

She drifted away, already looking for someone else to talk at.

I didn’t look at Charlie immediately. If I praised him too openly, he’d start performing for praise. I wanted him performing for standards.

We walked a few paces before I spoke.

“Good,” I said.

Charlie’s eyes flicked to mine for half a second, startled by the acknowledgement. Then he looked forward again, as though he didn’t trust himself to hold it.

“You didn’t apologise,” I added.

His throat bobbed. “I almost did.”

“But you didn’t.”

He nodded once, a small, contained victory.

A man in a blazer—no costume, but a lanyard and the self-assured posture of someone who assumed access—stepped in front of me next.

“Excuse me,” he said, smile sharpened to something managerial. “I wanted to ask—who’s responsible for the signage? It’s a bit… confusing. I’m trying to find the cooperage demonstration.”

I recognised him: one of the “friends of the Faire” committee men, the kind who did not volunteer so much as supervise. The kind who believed his opinions were helpful by virtue of existing.

“I’m responsible for Wardrobe,” I said, pleasant. “Signage is not my domain.”

“Oh, but surely you can direct me,” he insisted, leaning slightly forward as if proximity were authority. “It’s all connected, isn’t it?”

I watched him attempt to draw me into a conversation that would swallow ten minutes and deliver nothing.

This, too, was a test—not for Charlie, but for my own restraint.

Before I could respond, Charlie moved.

Not stepping in front of me. Not being dramatic. Simply angling his body slightly so he became a gentle interruption between the man’s trajectory and mine.

He didn’t touch. He didn’t crowd. He just… occupied space with purpose.

“I can point you,” Charlie said, voice quiet but clear. “Cooperage is past the bakery stall. Second left after the apothecary cart.”

The man blinked. Committee men hate being efficiently handled by people they haven’t categorised.

He gave Charlie a quick look, then turned back to me, looking for permission to accept the answer.

I gave him nothing but calm. “That’s correct.”

“Well,” he said stiffly, “thank you.”

He walked away, not quite sure what had happened.

Charlie returned to my shoulder position without being told.

I kept walking.

It wasn’t until we’d passed out of earshot that I spoke again.

“You knew that,” I said.

Charlie nodded. “I walked past it earlier when Graham was shouting at the benches.”

“Good,” I said. “You observed.”

He hesitated, then asked, careful, “Was that… okay?”

It wasn’t quite an apology. It was a check-in. A healthy one.

I glanced at him. “It was useful.”

His shoulders loosened slightly, as if “useful” were a kind of permission he understood.

We continued along the path.

People looked at us. Of course they did. They looked at clothing and assumed it contained a story. They looked at a young man in period kit and tried to decide if it was charming or funny or strange or something they could buy with a comment.

Charlie didn’t give them anything to buy.

He walked like a worker. He held his posture like a tool. He kept his face neutral.

And because he did, the gaze slid off him. Not entirely—nothing makes you invisible to everyone—but enough that the wrong kind of attention failed to stick.

That was the point.

We reached the morning tea area again, where a small cluster had formed—two women, a man, my mother’s friend Lisette, all in the slow orbit of donor conversation.

Lisette caught my eye and smiled. “Celeste! Darling. Everything alright?”

I answered with the truth that mattered. “Everything is contained.”

Her smile softened with approval. Lisette respected competence.

Then her gaze flicked to Charlie and her expression became—just for a second—questioning. Not prurient. Not mocking. Simply: *who is this and why is he with you?*

This was the real pivot point. The subtle one.

I could have said, “He’s helping.” I could have given a little story. I could have made it cute.

I didn’t.

I said the simplest thing in the world.

“He’s with Wardrobe,” I told her.

It framed him as function. It framed him as part of the machine, not a spectacle.

Lisette nodded as if that explained everything it needed to explain. “Ah.”

I kept walking.

Charlie kept pace.

A minute later, without looking at him, I said, “You did well.”

He inhaled sharply, as if the words had surprised him by being real.

“Thank you,” he said—then stopped, caught himself, and didn’t add anything else.

Good.

As we moved toward the next problem on my list, I realised something with a clarity that annoyed me, because I didn’t like noticing dependencies too early.

It wasn’t that Charlie obeyed.

It was that he *reduced friction.*

He absorbed people who would otherwise cling to me. He redirected questions without turning them into drama. He took social weight and made it lighter—quietly, without demanding recognition for it.

That was rare.

And rarity, in a system like mine, becomes value.

Not sentimental value.

Operational value.

I glanced at him—just once—and found him watching the path ahead with that careful attentiveness, as if the world were a series of small failures he could prevent if he stayed alert.

He wasn’t looking for applause.

He was looking for what I would need next.

And that—more than any garment—was the first true shape of “companion” taking form.

[Emily]  
Of course. Here are **Scenes Seven and Eight re-told fully through Celeste’s eyes**—first-person, with her particular blend of cool observation, pragmatic care, and quiet authority. Same beats, same purpose, just anchored inside her head.

---

## Scene Seven — *Lauren Rossignol arrives* (Celeste POV)

Lauren Rossignol didn’t enter Wardrobe like a mother storming into a school office.

She entered like a woman who’d had enough of other people’s chaos and had finally decided she would not add to it—not even for her own child.

She stopped just inside the doorway, canvas tote on her shoulder, keys in her hand as if the weight of them was something she could press against her palm to stay calm. Her hair was pulled back too tight to be for beauty. Her face was clean—no makeup, no performance. Her expression was not soft.

Mara looked up from the cutting table, pencil tucked behind her ear, pattern paper spread out like a land survey.

“Can I help you,” Mara said, the way she said it to everyone: flat, not unfriendly, not inviting.

“I’m Charlie’s mother,” the woman replied.

I didn’t look up immediately. I kept tagging garment bags at the rail and let Mara hold the room the way she always did. Wardrobe was hers. If you wanted to keep things clean, you didn’t wrestle the centre off her.

Mara’s eyes shifted, just slightly, like a lens tightening focus.

“Right,” Mara said. “Lauren.”

The woman blinked—only once. It wasn’t a flinch. It was surprise at being named before she’d offered it.

She looked around the room. Not with curiosity, but with assessment. Rails. Mannequin. Prototype jacket pinned into shape. Worktable cleared for pattern paper instead of emergency mending. The place had changed, and she could see it.

“My son says he isn’t going back to school,” she said. “He says he’s working here.”

Mara nodded once as if she’d been told the weather.

“He is.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “He’s eighteen. He’s leaving Year Twelve. That’s not… smart.”

Mara didn’t soften. She didn’t reassure.

“It’s not what you wanted,” she said.

Lauren exhaled through her nose, controlled. There was fatigue in it. The kind you got when you had carried too many people’s consequences and were tired of pretending you weren’t.

“No,” she said. “It isn’t.”

Mara flicked two fingers towards the chair by the table. Not an invitation. Permission.

Lauren sat carefully and kept her keys on her knee rather than putting them on the table, as if she didn’t want to claim space she hadn’t earned. Her tote stayed on her shoulder.

“You’re running a studio,” she observed, eyes still moving. “Not… a dressing-up shop.”

Mara’s mouth tightened.

“Correct.”

Lauren nodded once. Then she asked the only question worth asking—plain, adult, without theatrics.

“Is he hiding here?”

The women in the room didn’t stop moving, but the air shifted. Everyone heard it. No one pretended not to.

Mara’s gaze slid to Charlie at the inventory drawer. He was sorting hooks and tape with his usual precision, head down, hands clean, shoulders quiet. He didn’t look up to see if anyone was talking about him. He didn’t perform awareness. That alone told you he’d been in trouble before, and had learned the only safe way to survive it: work as if work is prayer.

“He’s not hiding,” Mara said. “Not the way you mean.”

Lauren’s fingers tightened around her keys. “And the way you mean?”

Mara’s eyes returned to her.

“The way I mean is he’s chosen a room that rewards him for being precise,” Mara said. “School doesn’t.”

“School is still school,” Lauren said, as if saying it made it unavoidable.

Mara nodded once—conceding the fact without granting it authority.

“And this is still work,” Mara replied. “With deadlines. With standards. With consequences.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked to Charlie again. Her voice stayed level, but I caught the fear under it: not the fear of him failing, the fear of him being swallowed.

“He’s not built for consequences,” she said.

Mara raised one eyebrow.

“He is,” she said, crisp. “He’s built for them more than most. He just doesn’t tolerate being mocked while he learns.”

Lauren’s throat moved. She swallowed it down.

“He’s always been… gentle,” she said, like the word might be misinterpreted if it left her mouth too clearly. “And school treats gentleness like weakness.”

“School treats anything it can’t classify as weakness,” Mara said. “That’s what institutions do.”

Lauren looked down at her keys for a beat. When she looked up again, the calm was still there, but it had a new edge: the edge of a mother who was no longer negotiating with herself.

“I’m disappointed,” she said. “I wanted him to finish. I wanted that paper. I wanted him to have choices.”

Mara let the sentence sit without decorating it.

Lauren continued, quieter now. “But I also don’t want him to be eaten alive.”

Mara’s gaze sharpened as if she’d heard the one honest thing in a room full of polite lies.

“I don’t run a sanctuary,” Mara said. “If he’s here, he works. He doesn’t drift. He doesn’t disappear mid-task because he can’t cope.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked to Charlie.

“He disappears when he’s ashamed,” she said.

Mara nodded once, filing it like a measurement.

“Then he learns not to,” Mara said. “Or he doesn’t stay.”

Lauren didn’t like it. I could see that. But she didn’t reject it either. Harshness was not the same as cruelty. It was sometimes the only honest form of care.

Her gaze moved—briefly—to the fitting curtains.

“And you’re comfortable,” she asked carefully, “having him here? Around… around all this?”

Mara’s eyes narrowed.

“You mean around women.”

Lauren didn’t flinch. She didn’t deny it.

“Yes.”

Mara leaned forward slightly, not threatening—simply making the boundary visible.

“This is a women’s space,” she said. “It stays that way because we keep it that way. He is not entitled to anything in this room. He’s here because he is useful and respectful. If that changes, he’s out.”

Lauren’s shoulders loosened a fraction, as if that sentence unknotted something she’d been carrying.

Mara sat back.

“Now,” she said, brisk, “what do you actually want.”

Lauren inhaled, then answered without wobble.

“I want to know if this is real,” she said. “Not a phase. Not him hiding because school is hard. Real training. Real work. Real future.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the prototype jacket and back.

“It’s real,” she said. “Because I’m making it real.”

Lauren held her gaze. Then she brought my name into the room like she was testing it.

“And where does Celeste fit into this?”

Mara didn’t look at me when she answered. She didn’t need to. It wasn’t my authority that mattered.

“Celeste is the research,” Mara said. “The direction. The brain that won’t let the work get lazy.”

Lauren’s eyes came to me then—direct, sharp.

“And you,” she said. “Are you rescuing him?”

That was the moment you could ruin everything with softness.

I lifted my head.

“No,” I said. One clean syllable. “He’s working. Mara decides whether he stays.”

Mara’s mouth twitched—approval, minimal.

Lauren nodded once. As if she’d asked what she needed to ask and received the answer she needed to hear.

She stood and shifted her tote into her hand. From it she drew a folded bundle of fabric.

“This is his,” she said, placing it on the table without ceremony. “He left it at home. I washed it. I pressed it. Whatever it is.”

Mara unfolded it: a linen apron. Hemmed cleanly. Ties reinforced. Stitching invisible.

Mara’s gaze flicked to Lauren.

“You sewed this.”

“I fixed it,” Lauren said, like the difference mattered.

Mara ran a finger along the stitching.

“Good work,” she said.

Lauren blinked again. A small, involuntary surprise at praise that wasn’t wrapped in obligation.

Mara folded the apron and set it with the issued workwear as if it had been accepted into the system.

Lauren looked at Charlie.

“Charlie,” she said, louder now, not to shame him but to place truth where it belonged. “I’m disappointed. I wanted you to finish.”

Charlie’s hands paused. He didn’t turn around.

“I know,” he said quietly.

Lauren swallowed whatever wanted to rise in her throat. I respected her for that. Not because emotion is weakness—but because she knew this wasn’t the room for it.

Mara cut cleanly across the moment.

“Rossignol,” she called. “Continue.”

Charlie resumed immediately.

Lauren exhaled once, like she’d just watched her son survive something without disintegrating.

She picked up her keys again and looked at Mara.

“If he’s here,” she said, “he works.”

Mara nodded. “Correct.”

“And if the school comes sniffing,” Lauren added—her voice now containing something new: not panic, but readiness.

Mara’s gaze hardened. “They can sniff elsewhere.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. Not a smile. Relief in disguise.

She turned to go, paused at the door, and looked back at Mara.

“I don’t do pity,” she said. “He won’t survive that.”

Mara answered immediately, without softness.

“Neither do I,” she said. “That’s why he might.”

Lauren left. The door clicked shut. The room returned to its rhythm.

Mara looked at me, pencil still behind her ear.

“Your friend,” she said.

“She’s not my friend,” I replied.

Mara’s mouth twitched again, faintly amused.

“Good,” she said. “Keep it clean.”

---

## Scene Eight — *Two women, the same map* (Celeste POV)

Lauren returned a week later, and she didn’t look like she’d slept badly this time.

She still looked tired—because mothers are always tired—but the braced edge had softened into something else: acceptance with boundaries. Like she’d stopped fighting the fact of what was happening and started watching how well it was being done.

She didn’t bring keys to squeeze. She brought a small paper bag that smelled like coffee and warm pastry.

Mara glanced up from the worktable.

“We don’t eat over fabric,” she said.

Lauren nodded as if she’d expected that.

“I didn’t bring it for you to eat over fabric,” she said. Dry humour, controlled. “I brought it because you look like the sort of woman who forgets food when she’s busy.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed.

“I don’t forget,” Mara said. “I postpone.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Yes. That.”

I stayed near the rail, letting them speak. This wasn’t my meeting. This was infrastructure forming.

Lauren stood and watched the room—quietly, not intrusively.

The atelier had taken shape fast. The new garments were not prettier for the sake of it; they were *better*. Reinforced where stress hit. Forgiving where bodies moved. Designed for the real physics of the faire instead of the fantasy of it.

Charlie had become the engine beneath it. He didn’t talk much. He simply made things survive.

Lauren watched him now near the fitting curtains, holding a bodice steady while Mara adjusted a seam on the mannequin.

He didn’t look up for her approval. He didn’t seek her face like a boy asking permission.

He simply worked.

Lauren’s expression shifted. Pride, restrained so tightly it nearly looked like pain.

Mara noticed it without looking.

“You can watch,” Mara said. “Just don’t hover. He doesn’t need that.”

“I’m not hovering,” Lauren replied.

Mara’s mouth twitched. “You’re hovering in French.”

Lauren let out a short laugh that startled even her, as if humour had slipped out before she could stop it.

“You’re Australian,” she said. “You shouldn’t know that.”

Mara went back to her pins. “Women are women,” she said. “Different accents.”

Lauren stepped closer to the worktable and reached into her tote. She pulled out a small notebook. When she opened it, I saw fabric swatches taped in neat rows.

“I’ve got a supplier in Sydney,” Lauren said, voice turning practical—the way women often smuggled intimacy in under logistics. “Linen that doesn’t go transparent under light. Not cheap. But consistent. If you’re moving into design, you’ll want consistent.”

Mara’s fingers paused. For Mara, that was a reaction.

She held out her hand. “Let me see.”

Lauren passed the notebook across.

Mara examined the swatches the way she examined everything: with honesty. Thumb and forefinger, rubbing the weave lightly, testing body, strength, recovery.

“This one has spine,” Mara said. “It won’t collapse.”

Lauren nodded. “That’s why I used it.”

Mara’s eyes flicked up. “For what.”

Lauren didn’t answer immediately. She watched Charlie for a moment—his hands, his steadiness, the way he held fabric like it deserved respect.

Then she said, carefully, “For things that need to survive men.”

It was the first personal sentence she’d offered, and she didn’t dramatise it. She didn’t attach a story. She simply placed the truth on the table like a tool.

Mara’s face didn’t change much, but her eyes softened in a way only another woman would catch.

“Mm,” Mara said. “Yes.”

Lauren exhaled slowly, like she’d been holding her breath in her own life for too long.

“You’re protective,” Lauren said.

Mara snorted. “I’m professional.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “That’s what protective looks like when you’ve had enough.”

Mara didn’t deny it. She didn’t confirm it either. She returned the notebook and said instead, “You have standards.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked away briefly. When she spoke, her voice was quieter.

“You learn them,” she said, “or you get eaten.”

Mara looked at her then, steady.

“Yes,” Mara said. “Exactly.”

They held that look for a beat—no sentimentality, no softness—just recognition. Two women reading from the same map.

In the background, Charlie shifted fabric on the mannequin and said softly, “Mara—the seam’s pulling when you raise the arm.”

Mara turned immediately, attention snapping back to the work.

“Good catch,” she said, then added—because she couldn’t help herself—“Of course it is. It’s always there.”

Charlie didn’t smile. He didn’t preen. He just held the bodice steady while Mara repinned, the way he held everything: quietly, without demanding credit.

Lauren watched him again, and this time her pride showed slightly more openly.

“He’s… different,” she said.

“Good,” Mara replied. “Different is useful. Different is how you build better.”

Lauren’s throat moved. She swallowed.

“He wanted to quit school because he felt humiliated,” she said, and the word *humiliated* was controlled but bitter, like it didn’t belong in her mouth.

“Humiliation is a tool,” Mara said. “Some people use it because they have nothing else. We don’t use it here.”

Lauren nodded slowly, as if she needed to hear that from someone other than herself.

“And what do you use,” she asked, and I knew she wasn’t asking only for Charlie.

Mara tugged the fabric once, then twice, testing tension.

“We use standard,” she said. “We use consequence. We use work.”

Lauren stood still, as if those words were something she could finally rest on.

Then she surprised herself again by adding, lightly, “And coffee.”

Mara’s mouth twitched.

Lauren went to the side bench and opened the paper bag. Two coffees emerged—not delicate, not fancy. She set one near Mara’s elbow, away from fabric.

Mara stared at it like it might be a trap.

“Don’t make it a thing,” Lauren said, already turning away as if generosity had to be disguised to be tolerated.

Mara picked up the cup, took a sip, and said, grudgingly, “Fine.”

Lauren’s smile was brief and real.

In the fitting corner, Charlie glanced over—not at his mother exactly, but at the coffee, at the two women standing in quiet alliance. The look on his face wasn’t dramatic. It was the subtle weather-shift of someone realising the world might actually hold.

He didn’t ask what they’d talked about. He didn’t intrude.

He just returned to the seam and held the fabric steady while Mara corrected the line.

And for the first time since he’d walked out of school, I felt something settle into place—not refuge, not rescue.

Infrastructure.

Women building something that would hold.

And Charlie learning, quietly, how to live inside it.

---

If you’d like, next we can do **Scene Nine** from Celeste’s POV: the first time Charlie is *truly tested* by atelier pace (deadlines, a garment failure, a staff complaint), and we show him begin to flourish—without anyone soothing him, just *training him into competence*.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">




















[Q]  
Well, Lauren can't afford private school, so it's public school. Look, based on my exposure to students from the public system, it's actually quite good, particularly when compared to US public school system. More support, generally speaking. And UNIFORMS... an excellent thing, as they undermine the whole fashion/social hierarchy/peer pressure thing.

---

[Emily]  
Yep — if Lauren’s on a Victorian **government** school budget, your instincts about *how the system behaves* are broadly right: it’s usually more structured around **attendance + wellbeing + re-engagement** than the “shrug, you’re on your own” vibe people sometimes describe elsewhere. (Not perfect, but there are clearer rails.)

### Uniforms in Vic government schools

In Victoria, government schools can have a **student dress code / uniform policy** (set locally, typically via the school council). If a school has a uniform, students are generally expected to wear it during school hours, travel to/from school, and many school activities. ([Victoria Government][1])

So you can portray uniforms as a normal, accepted part of daily life in a Vic public school — and, yes, they *do* blunt a lot of the overt fashion-status theatre (even if kids still find other hierarchies).

A little extra veracity detail you can tuck away: Victoria has been moving to reduce uniform costs (e.g., changes affecting branded/logo items coming in from 2026 were announced publicly). ([Premier of Victoria][2])

### Attendance expectations and “support” tone

In Victoria, **schooling is compulsory from age 6 to 17** unless an exemption applies, and parents/carers have duties around enrolment and attendance in that window. ([Department of Education Victoria][3])

But your story’s key point is Charlie being **18** in Year 12. In Victorian government schools, there are **maximum-age rules**: generally, someone aged 18+ must not enrol/attend *unless* an exception/exemption applies. (There *are* exceptions, including senior secondary contexts.) ([Department of Education Victoria][4])

**Practical implication for your plot:**

* If Charlie is already enrolled in Year 12 and then stops attending mid-term, the school’s “teeth” are less about *compulsory attendance law* and more about **welfare duty-of-care, re-engagement processes, and pathway pressure** (“come to a meeting,” “let’s discuss options,” “you’re at risk of not completing,” etc.). ([Department of Education Victoria][3])

### What the school would likely *do* (story-friendly, realistic)

If Charlie stops showing up after that humiliating moment, a Vic public school will typically:

* contact Lauren about absences and ask for explanations / a meeting ([Department of Education Victoria][3])
* treat it as a **student engagement** problem (wellbeing / safety / learning support framing) rather than only “discipline” ([Department of Education Victoria][5])
* try to push a **pathway remedy** (alternative senior program, VET/VM-style route, re-engagement plan) rather than letting him silently evaporate ([Department of Education Victoria][5])

### How this affects your Scene Five onward

Because the system *is* comparatively “supporty,” your conflict stays beautifully in-lane if it’s **quiet resistance**:

* polite emails, formal meetings, “we’re concerned,” “we need to sight a plan,” “have you considered…”
* and Lauren’s position becomes nuanced: she doesn’t think the school is evil; she thinks it’s **the wrong machine for her son**.

That lets you avoid cartoon antagonists. The school isn’t monstrous; it’s simply not built for Charlie.

If you want, I can draft a short **school-to-Lauren phone call/email** (very Victorian government-school tone) that sets up the next pressure wave—without making anyone a villain—and then we pivot straight back into Wardrobe where Charlie flourishes under standards instead of scrutiny.

[Q]  
I think we can *allude* to those Lauren/school interaction in subsequent scenes, without creating too much of a story around that. I'd like to pull Lauren into the picture more as a supporting Mara and Celeste figure (women supporting women) as Lauren realises that Chalie's best chances involve Wardrobe: it is the perfect fit for him. This will give her the ability to counter some of the well-meaning but ill-informed system (school et al) recommendations for Charlie's future.

---

Yes — that’s the right choice. If you *show* too much school bureaucracy, it starts to feel like a different story. If you **allude** to it, you keep pace and keep the centre where it belongs: the women building something real.

And the move you’re proposing for Lauren is *excellent* because it does three things at once:

1. **Prevents Celeste from becoming Charlie’s sole anchor** (no rescue dynamic).
2. Turns Lauren into a **grown-up ally** to Mara and Celeste (women supporting women, competence network).
3. Gives the story a believable counter-force to the school’s “well-meaning but wrong-fit” advice: Lauren can *politely* resist it with evidence.

Here’s how to do it cleanly.

---

## How to allude to school pressure without making it a subplot

Use **tiny artefacts** that appear in the atelier world, not school scenes.

Examples (pick one per scene, max):

* Lauren walks in, puts her phone on silent, sighs: “That was the year-level coordinator. Again.”
* A letter in an envelope on Lauren’s kitchen bench, later seen tucked into her tote.
* Celeste overhears Lauren say: “Yes, I understand… no, he’s not ‘refusing support’—he’s working.”

No meetings on page. No “policy explainers.” Just the sense of a machine pressing.

---

## Lauren’s turn: what convinces her Wardrobe is the right fit

Give Lauren *evidence*, not sentiment.

Three crisp proof points she can observe:

1. **Regulation improves Charlie**
   At school he becomes smaller. In Wardrobe he becomes steadier, more orderly, more present.

2. **Adult standards suit him**
   He responds to: deadlines, checklists, quality control. Not to public performance.

3. **He produces real value**
   Garments that survive, problems solved, time saved. Lauren sees it in outcomes Mara can name.

Once Lauren has those, she can push back on school suggestions without it feeling ideological.

## How Lauren supports Mara + Celeste without stealing the spotlight

Make her support **logistical**, not emotional.

Great options:

* She shares suppliers (already started).
* She lends equipment (pressing ham, shears, tailor’s clapper, quality chalk, snap press).
* She offers a small paid alteration job that gives the atelier cash-flow + credibility.
* She helps create a “paper trail” of Charlie’s work (timesheets, tasks logged, photos of finished garments) so it reads as training, not hiding.

That last one is particularly useful: it gives Lauren armour against “he’s throwing his life away.”

---

## A clean new dynamic: “Triangulated authority”

This will sing if you keep their roles distinct:

* **Mara**: sets the standards and gates entry.
* **Celeste**: drives direction and research.
* **Lauren**: protects the legitimacy and stability (home + adult-facing world).

So when the school offers something generic (TAFE brochure, “pathways interview,” “just try harder”), Lauren isn’t emotional. She’s prepared:

> “He’s in structured work with measurable outcomes.”
> “He’s supervised.”
> “He’s progressing.”
> “We’re not improvising.”

That’s how you counter a system politely: with receipts.

## A scene idea that advances this with almost no exposition

### Scene Nine: “Lauren chooses a side”

Lauren arrives with a folder (not dramatic, just organised). Inside:

* a note from school, unopened,
* and a printed photo of Charlie’s reinforced garment on a staff member, with a little list: “what failed before / what we changed / results.”

Mara raises an eyebrow. “What’s that.”

Lauren: “Noise.” (nods at the school note)
Then she slides the photo forward: “This is signal.”

Mara’s mouth twitches. Celeste feels the quiet satisfaction of being backed by an adult woman who *gets it*.

Charlie sees the folder and goes still—not because he’s guilty, but because he expects to be pulled back into school’s orbit.

Lauren doesn’t soothe. She simply says, to him:

> “They can recommend whatever they like. I’m your mother. I’ve seen what works.”

No pep. Just alignment.

---

## One caution to keep it from tipping into “school bad”

Since you’ve observed the Vic public system is generally decent, you can maintain fairness by making the school’s guidance *reasonable but mismatched*:

* They’re not malicious.
* They’re not stupid.
* They just don’t have a category for “atelier apprenticeship inside a historical faire wardrobe department.”

That’s believable. And it preserves your tone.

If you’d like, I can draft **Scene Nine** (Lauren explicitly aligning with Mara/Celeste, with minimal school allusion and maximum forward motion), and use it to launch the next phase: Charlie’s first real “flourish” moment where he solves a design problem that even Mara respects.

## Scene Nine — *Signal and Noise* (Celeste POV)

Lauren arrived on a Tuesday, which I noticed only because Tuesdays were the days Mara tried to pretend she had time.

She didn’t, of course. Mara never did. But Tuesdays were when she scheduled her stubbornness. The cutting table was clear, the mannequin was dressed in half a bodice, and the new jacket prototype sat like a dare: *make me survive.*

Lauren stepped in with a flat folder under her arm and a tote on her shoulder. No coffee this time. No pastry peace offering. She looked neat, composed, and slightly sharpened around the edges—as if she’d spent the morning refusing to be moved by other people’s urgency.

Mara glanced up.

“What now,” she said, as if Lauren had become a regular inconvenience she secretly approved of.

Lauren didn’t waste time warming the air.

“They called again,” she said.

She didn’t specify who. She didn’t need to. That was the point of machines: they rarely required naming. Machines just kept turning.

Mara’s mouth tightened. “And.”

“And I told them I’d call back,” Lauren replied, and there was a quiet satisfaction in the sentence. Not triumph. Just control. “Which I won’t, unless I have to.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the folder.

“What’s that,” Mara asked.

Lauren placed the folder on the corner of the worktable, away from fabric, and opened it with an almost deliberate neatness—like she was demonstrating to herself that she could handle paper without it bleeding into her life.

Inside were two things: an envelope and a printed sheet.

The envelope was plain and official-looking. Lauren didn’t open it. She let it sit there like a dead insect she had no intention of touching.

The printed sheet she slid forward.

It was a photograph of one of the faire staff—Annie, one of the performers—wearing the new jacket prototype. Annie’s arms were raised in a dramatic pose, the kind that usually tore seams under the arm and split closures at the waist. But here the jacket held. Clean line. No strain. No gaping. The garment looked like it had been designed for a human body instead of a mannequin fantasy.

Below the photo, Lauren had typed a short list. Not poetic. Not emotional. Just facts:

* **Previous issue:** underarm seam tearing after repeated movement
* **Change:** reinforced gusset + eased sleeve head + seam tape at stress line
* **Result:** 3 full shifts; no tear; improved comfort; faster dressing
* **Notes:** closure placement adjusted for quick change; no snagging

It was written like an incident report. Like a nurse charting something in a ward. Like a woman who didn’t trust feelings to convince anyone.

Mara stared at it.

Lauren said, evenly, “This is signal.”

Then she tapped the unopened envelope with one finger.

“And that,” she added, “is noise.”

Mara’s mouth twitched—almost amused, almost approving.

“You’ve been busy,” she said.

Lauren shrugged. “I’ve been paying attention.”

I felt something settle in my chest that wasn’t relief exactly. More like… reinforcement. Women reinforcing each other the way we reinforced seams. Because stress found weakness, and we weren’t interested in being weak.

Across the room, Charlie was at the side bench, pinning a lining into a bodice piece. He hadn’t looked up when Lauren entered; he never did. He didn’t seek permission for his attention. That was part of why Wardrobe suited him. Here, people didn’t have to perform being seen.

But he did look now.

Not to the photo at first.

To the envelope.

Something in him still reacted to official paper the way some people react to sirens—an instinctive tightening in the gut. His hands slowed. A pin hovered between his fingers.

Lauren noticed without turning. Mothers always did.

“Don’t,” she said, quietly.

Charlie blinked. “Don’t… what.”

“Don’t go pale,” Lauren replied, and there was no cruelty in it. Just bluntness. “You’re not in trouble in this room.”

He swallowed and looked down at his hands again. He tried to make them move at normal speed.

Mara picked up the printed sheet and read it properly. You could tell when she stopped seeing it as a thing someone had handed her and started seeing it as information. Her eyes tracked the lines. Her thumb pressed the paper unconsciously, testing it as if it were fabric.

“This,” Mara said, tapping the list, “is actually useful.”

Lauren nodded. “That’s the idea.”

Mara’s gaze slid to the envelope. “And that.”

Lauren’s expression sharpened. “They want a meeting. They want ‘pathways.’ They want him back in a system that already told him what it thinks of him.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “And what do you think.”

Lauren didn’t answer quickly. She glanced at Charlie—brief, controlled—and then back at Mara.

“I think,” she said, “that if he goes back there now, he’ll disappear again. Not dramatically. Not loudly. He’ll just… turn off.”

My throat tightened a fraction. It was exactly right. Charlie didn’t explode; he evaporated.

Lauren continued, voice still calm.

“And I think,” she added, “that if he stays here, he’ll have to show up. You don’t allow drifting. You don’t allow hiding. You make him do something real.”

Mara didn’t soften. That wasn’t her style. But she did something else: she accepted the statement as if it were a contract.

“He works,” Mara said.

Lauren nodded. “Yes. He works.”

I watched Mara set the paper down carefully, the way you set down something you intend to keep.

“What are you asking me for,” Mara said then, looking at Lauren.

Lauren met her gaze.

“Permission,” she said. “Not for him. For me.”

Mara’s eyebrow lifted.

Lauren’s mouth tightened, and for the first time there was something like vulnerability in her voice—but it was framed properly, the way women did when they refused to make their needs into someone else’s burden.

“I want to be able to say—truthfully—that he isn’t ‘dropping out.’ He’s transitioning into supervised work. Training. Something with standards. Something you’re willing to put your name on.”

Mara’s gaze held hers.

“You want me on the hook,” Mara said.

Lauren didn’t flinch. “Yes.”

A beat.

Mara looked across the room at Charlie, who had resumed pinning, slower than before but steady. He wasn’t eavesdropping; he was simply present enough to feel the air changing.

Mara’s eyes returned to Lauren.

“You’re not asking for a favour,” Mara said. “You’re asking for a structure.”

Lauren nodded once. “Exactly.”

Mara exhaled through her nose. She didn’t like being managed. But she liked competence. She liked women who spoke plainly.

“Fine,” Mara said. “Here’s the structure. If he is here full-time, he is here full-time. He keeps hours. He logs tasks. He does training modules the way I set them. He gets evaluated. And if he fails, he doesn’t get protected by his mother.”

Charlie’s hand stopped again, just for a fraction.

Lauren’s voice didn’t soften.

“Agreed,” she said.

Charlie looked up then—finally—and his gaze flicked from Lauren to Mara, and then, briefly, to me. He looked bewildered in the way he always did when adults made decisions near him, as if he didn’t know whether he was about to be punished or adopted.

Mara called him without raising her voice.

“Rossignol.”

Charlie stood immediately. Not like a soldier. Like someone trained by women: quick, attentive, trying not to waste anyone’s time.

“Yes,” he said.

Mara held up the printed sheet.

“Your mother brought receipts,” Mara said. “This is good. This is how you win against paperwork. We will do this properly.”

Charlie stared at the photo. His mouth parted slightly. He looked genuinely confused—not by the garment, but by the fact that his work had been recorded like it mattered.

Lauren spoke then, not to soothe him, not to praise him into embarrassment, but to anchor him.

“They can recommend whatever they like,” she said. “I’m your mother. I’ve seen what works.”

Charlie swallowed. “Mum, I—”

“No,” Lauren cut in, gentle but firm. “Don’t apologise. I’m not asking for that. I’m asking you to stay visible.”

Charlie blinked, and the word *visible* hit him like a strange request. Visibility had never been safe for him.

Mara’s tone snapped it back into something he could understand.

“Visible,” Mara said, “means you write down what you do. You show up on time. You finish tasks. You don’t vanish. You want to be here? Then you exist.”

Charlie’s throat bobbed. He nodded once.

“Yes,” he said. “I can do that.”

“Good,” Mara said, and then she turned, brisk, back to the mannequin. “Then you can start now.”

She gestured at the prototype jacket.

“This jacket pulls at the underarm when Annie raises her arms,” Mara said. “We’ve solved it once. I want it solved twice. I want it solved so it survives summer heat and tourists and the stupid way people grab sleeves. I want it solved without adding bulk that ruins the silhouette.”

She looked at Charlie sharply.

“Tell me where it fails.”

Charlie stepped closer to the mannequin. His hands didn’t tremble. That was the difference between school and here: here, hands were allowed to be useful.

He lifted the sleeve gently and pressed the seam line with his fingertips. His eyes narrowed, focused.

“It’s not the seam,” he said quietly. “It’s the angle. The gusset’s correct, but the sleeve head is fighting it. You need two millimetres more ease here… and the tape needs to stop before the pivot point, not run through it.”

Mara’s face changed—not dramatically, just the tiny shift of a professional hearing a solution that makes sense.

“That,” Mara said, “is an answer.”

Lauren watched him with that restrained pride again. Not soft. Not indulgent. Just… steady.

I realised, watching the three of them in the same room—Mara with her standards, Lauren with her adult refusal to be bullied by systems, Charlie with his quiet competence—that something had clicked into place.

Not rescue.

Not refuge.

A triangle of authority that could hold.

Lauren reached for the envelope at last, slid it back into the folder without opening it, and closed the folder with a neat, final motion.

“Alright,” she said. “Now I can call them back.”

Mara didn’t look up from the sleeve. “Tell them he’s busy.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “I will.”

Then she picked up her tote, nodded once at me—not warmth, exactly, but acknowledgement—and moved to the door.

As she left, she paused and looked back at Mara.

“Thank you,” she said.

Mara didn’t accept gratitude the way most people did. She accepted it the way she accepted fabric swatches: with suspicion.

“Don’t thank me,” Mara said. “Just don’t undermine me.”

Lauren nodded once. “I won’t.”

The door clicked shut.

In the quiet that followed, Charlie returned to the mannequin and began marking the seam line with tailor’s chalk, his movements careful and certain.

And I thought: **this is what he needed.**

Not a kinder classroom.

A room where competence was not entertainment.

A room where women built reality and demanded he live inside it.

A room where the system’s noise could stay outside the door—because inside, we had signal.
