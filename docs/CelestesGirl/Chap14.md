# Confederates

Yes to all of it — and **“Charl”** is a superb choice: it’s close enough to be muscle-memory, it avoids theatricality, and it reads like a practical shorthand rather than a “new identity.” It’s exactly the kind of administrative camouflage that stays squeaky clean.

And yes: Celeste absolutely needs **confederates**. Not a committee, not a chorus — just one or two women who understand what she’s doing and why, and who can help keep it “boring,” safe, and consistent. Talia is ideal because she’s already demonstrated the right kind of seriousness: she cares about boundaries, not gossip.

Below is the next scene: Celeste POV, Talia as confederate, Charl learning movement as *function*, Celeste helpful (not tender), and the deeper shift you want — the unfairness becoming visible from the inside.

## Celeste — Confederates

By the time the shift and stays were on, Charlie had stopped shaking.

Not because he’d become comfortable. Because the body has limits; it can only sustain panic for so long before it converts it into something quieter and meaner: endurance.

He stood in front of the mirror at a slight angle, not looking at his reflection directly, as if eye contact with himself might make the situation more real than he could bear.

He was in petticoat and gown now—plain, dark, practical. Apron tied. Cap in my hand, his hair pinned up and contained beneath my fingers as I worked.

He kept his eyes fixed on the seam of the rug.

“Don’t crane your neck,” I said.

“I’m not,” he replied automatically.

“You are,” I corrected. “You’re trying to disappear. You can’t. People notice that.”

He swallowed. “Right.”

I finished the last pins, then placed the cap over the shape of his hair with the same efficiency I used on everyone else. No ceremony. No pause.

When I stepped back, the effect was immediate in the way good illusion always is: not magic, but *coherence.* The silhouette made sense. The posture made sense. The kit made sense.

Charlie—*Charl*, for the purpose of this—looked like labour.

Which meant the world would treat him accordingly.

He raised his hands slightly, unsure what to do with them. “This is… ridiculous.”

“Say that again,” I said.

He blinked. “What?”

“Say it again. In the same tone. Exactly like you just did,” I instructed.

Charlie frowned, confused. “This is… ridiculous.”

It came out higher, thinner than his normal voice. Not a falsetto. Not a performance. Just a slight lift—like someone trying to be heard without taking up space.

I watched him register it.

His eyes widened. “I didn’t—”

“I know,” I said. “That’s why it works.”

He looked faintly sick. “Celeste…”

“Charl,” I corrected, and saw him flinch.

I didn’t soften it. Names are tools. Tools require consistency.

“Yes,” he said quietly.

I nodded once. “Better.”

He stared down at his skirt as if it had personally betrayed him.

Then he tried to walk.

The first step was awkward—not comical, not theatrical. Just unfamiliar. His foot caught the hem lightly. His shoulders tensed. He moved his hips the wrong way, like he was trying to avoid moving them at all.

He stopped after two steps, jaw clenched.

“I can’t do this,” he said.

“You can,” I replied. “You just don’t know how yet.”

He took another step, then another. The skirt pulled. His stride shortened. He looked angry at himself for not being able to move normally in something so stupidly simple.

I watched, then said, less coldly now—not gentle, but practical.

“Don’t fight it,” I told him. “Your legs don’t need to change. Your pace does. Smaller steps. Let the fabric move first.”

Charlie tried again, forcing himself to slow down. He looked like a person learning to carry a tray: tense, careful, overthinking every motion.

“Your hands,” I added. “Stop hovering. Put one on the apron. It gives your body a story.”

Charlie did it automatically—hand flattening against the apron front. The change was immediate: the posture became less like a boy caught in a joke and more like staff in motion.

He stared at his hand like it had betrayed him too.

“This is—” he started.

“Don’t,” I said.

He swallowed it back.

I opened the back room door and listened for a moment. Wardrobe noise. Mara’s voice, clipped. The steady cadence of sewing and sorting and small controlled chaos.

I stepped out, beckoning him to follow.

Charlie—Charl—followed.

The moment he crossed the threshold into Wardrobe, the world changed by a degree.

Not because anyone stared. Because everyone registered him the way they register any new object in a room: a quick scan for category, then a decision about what it means.

Mara looked up first.

Her gaze landed on him, flicked once across the kit, then went to me.

The smallest lift of her eyebrows: *You’ve done it.*

She didn’t smile. She didn’t comment. She simply went back to her work as if a maid had always been in that corner.

That mattered.

Charlie looked at her, almost pleading for some acknowledgement that this was insane.

Mara gave him nothing.

Good woman.

Talia came in a moment later with a bundle of ribbons and a practical expression that didn’t care about anyone’s feelings.

She stopped dead when she saw him.

She stared.

Charlie’s entire body went rigid, as if recognised.

Talia’s eyes narrowed. She took one step closer—not invasive, just careful. She looked at his face, then at the cap, then back again.

It was the look women give when they’re running their internal safety maths.

Then she said, calmly, “Okay. That’s… effective.”

Charlie blinked. “Talia—”

“Charl,” I said, and held her gaze.

Talia flicked her eyes to me, then back to him. “Right,” she said. “Charl.”

Charlie’s mouth tightened at the casual ease of it. It hurt him, I could tell, not because she was mocking him—but because she was *complying*.

Because compliance meant this was real.

Talia turned her head slightly, voice lowering. “Is this what I think it is?”

“Yes,” I said.

“Optics,” she guessed.

“Yes.”

Talia exhaled through her nose. “Of course.”

Charlie looked between us, suddenly aware of what was happening: women coordinating without him being the centre of the drama.

He seemed… shut out.

Good. This wasn’t his story to control.

Talia stepped closer to me, still speaking low. “Who knows?”

“Only Wardrobe,” I said, “and only because Wardrobe needs to enforce consistency.”

Talia nodded once. “And management?”

“They think they’ve contained me,” I replied. “They haven’t.”

Talia’s eyes sharpened with interest. “You’re bringing your standard with you.”

“Yes.”

Talia looked at Charlie again, then said, blunt and not unkind, “You alright?”

Charlie’s throat moved. “No.”

Talia nodded as if he’d reported the weather. “Yeah. Fair.”

Then she turned to me. “You’ll need someone to cover him. Not in the usual way.”

“I know,” I said.

Talia’s gaze flicked to Charlie’s hands—how he held them, how he tried not to fidget, how his body was fighting the urge to shrink.

“He’ll need coaching,” she said quietly. “Not on sewing. On… moving.”

“I’m already doing it,” I said.

Talia’s mouth tightened. “Good. And he needs to understand one more thing.”

Charlie looked up sharply, wary.

Talia met his eyes, and her voice went flat with female truth.

“People will be nicer to you,” she said, “and it won’t be because they’ve become better people.”

Charlie stared at her.

Talia continued, matter-of-fact. “Some will ignore you completely. Some will talk over you. Some will treat you like furniture. Some will think they’re entitled to comment on you.”

Charlie’s face drained.

“And if you speak too loudly,” Talia added, “they’ll call you difficult. If you speak too softly, they’ll pretend you didn’t speak at all.”

Charlie’s lips parted. No sound came out.

I watched him take it in, the way you watch someone step into cold water and realise it’s deeper than they thought.

Charlie’s voice came out small. “Why would they—”

Talia cut in with a short, humourless laugh. “Because they can.”

Silence fell.

It wasn’t dramatic silence. It was the silence of a truth that doesn’t require theatre.

I said, “Talia is right.”

Charlie’s eyes snapped to mine.

“Listen to her,” I added, because this was where confederates matter. Charlie needed the truth to come from more than just me. Otherwise it would always feel like my personal project, my personal distortion.

Talia looked at me then, assessing.

“You’re taking him into the manor?” she asked.

“Yes.”

Talia’s eyebrows rose. “Bold.”

“Necessary,” I corrected.

Talia nodded once. “You want my help.”

It wasn’t a question. It was an offer.

“Yes,” I said.

Talia glanced toward Mara, then back. “Mara will pretend she hates it. She’ll still enforce it.”

“I know,” I said.

Talia looked at Charlie again. Her expression softened by a millimetre—not pity, but professionalism.

“You’ve got long hair,” she said. “That helps. Your face reads young. Your shoulders are narrow enough that the kit sits correctly.”

Charlie flinched at being assessed like a garment.

Talia didn’t care. “But your eyes will give you away.”

Charlie blinked. “My eyes?”

“You look like you’re about to apologise for existing,” Talia said. “Stop.”

Charlie’s jaw tightened. “I can’t just stop.”

Talia shrugged. “You can. It’ll just take practice.”

I stepped in then, because Charlie was beginning to spiral into that internal shame that would make him clumsy and therefore visible.

“Charl,” I said.

He looked at me.

“Walk to the door,” I instructed. “Then back.”

Charlie hesitated.

“Now,” I said, simply.

He did it.

The first three steps were wrong—too stiff, too cautious. He was over-managing his skirt instead of letting it do its job. His shoulders were tight. His chin was too tucked.

I watched and corrected in small, helpful doses:

“Loosen your shoulders.”

He tried.

“Lift your gaze. Not high. Just level.”

He did.

“Short steps. Let the hem move.”

He tried again.

He reached the door. Turned. Came back.

Better.

Not natural yet. But less like a boy in a prank and more like staff in training.

When he stopped, he was breathing a little harder, as if he’d run a sprint.

He looked at me, eyes bright with restrained panic.

“This is…” he began.

I cut him off, not harshly. Cleanly.

“It needs to look natural,” I said.

Charlie’s mouth tightened. “To protect you.”

“Yes,” I replied.

He swallowed, then said the thing that finally gave him shape—personality not through defiance, but through principle.

“And if it ruins you anyway?” he asked.

That was the question underneath all his obedience. Not “will I look silly.” Not “will I be mocked.” But: *what if my sacrifice doesn’t even save you?*

It made my chest tighten.

Inconvenient.

I kept my voice steady. “Then it will not be because of you.”

Charlie stared at me.

I continued, letting the truth stand on its own. “It will be because they were always going to try. This isn’t magic. It’s friction control.”

Charlie nodded slowly.

Talia watched us, eyes narrowed, and I could almost see the thought forming in her: *Celeste is not just keeping a runner. She’s building a household.*

A household is power. A household is women’s infrastructure.

Exactly.

Charlie looked down at his apron again, fingers pressing into the fabric as if anchoring himself.

Then he said, quietly, “What do I call you?”

Mara snorted from across the room. “Oh, for God’s sake.”

Talia didn’t laugh. She understood the seriousness of the question. Names are what keep you safe—or get you punished.

I answered without hesitation.

“Miss Shelley in public,” I said. “If you need to be formal: ‘my lady’ only when someone else is listening. Not because I need it. Because they expect it.”

Charlie nodded. “And… you call me… Charl.”

“Yes,” I said.

He flinched again. Then, after a beat, he nodded once more—acceptance, reluctant but real.

Talia stepped closer to him and adjusted the apron ties with brisk efficiency, not touching skin, not making it intimate.

“There,” she said. “That’ll stop it slipping.”

Charlie stared at her hands as if she’d just performed a spell.

Talia met his eyes. “Don’t look grateful,” she said. “It reads like an apology.”

Charlie blinked. “What should I look like?”

Talia’s mouth curled slightly—not a smile, exactly. A recognition.

“Bored,” she said. “Like you’ve done it a hundred times.”

Charlie stared.

Then something shifted in his expression. Not joy. Not thrill.

Understanding.

The beginnings of grief.

Because boredom wasn’t a mood.

It was armour.

And he was only just realising who’d been wearing it all along.
