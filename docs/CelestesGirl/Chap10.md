# Inconvenient

Yes — *exactly that.* “Inconvenient” is doing heavy, elegant work for you because it frames her emotional awakening in the only language she’ll initially permit herself: **systems language**.

She won’t admit, “I care.”
She’ll admit, “This variable is becoming non-optional.”

And the delicious tension is that she can’t solve it by being more strategic. Strategy is what *created* the condition.

Here are a few ways to make “inconvenient” worth a chapter without turning Celeste soft or self-pitying:

---

## 1) Make her emotions show up as operational distortions

She notices herself doing things she can’t justify *on paper*:

* **Over-allocating protection** to Charlie compared with any other staffer
* **Watching** the social weather around him more closely than she needs to for wardrobe continuity
* **Pre-empting** conflicts she would normally allow to self-resolve
* **Choosing words** carefully so as not to destabilise him
* **Scheduling him near her** even when it isn’t strictly required

She’ll catalogue these as “inefficiencies” and be irritated by them.

That’s your humanity: she’s not emotional — she’s *angry at emotion.*

---

## 2) Give her a private “audit” moment

A chapter built around her trying to demote the feeling by turning it into an inventory task.

For example:

* She tries to write a list: *Reasons to keep Charlie.*
* Then catches herself writing things that aren’t reasons, they’re admissions:

  * “He calms when given rules.”
  * “He reduces friction.”
  * “He doesn’t drain me.”
  * “He believes me.”

She stares at “believes me” like it’s a typo.

That’s a whole scene.

---

## 3) Make “inconvenient” a threat to her self-image

Strategist Celeste thinks of herself as:

* self-contained
* competent
* unneeding

So emotional attachment reads to her as:

* a lever someone could pull
* a bias that could corrupt her judgement
* a dependency loop

She can’t tolerate the idea of being *readable.*

The moment another woman (Talia) names it, it becomes external. That’s intolerable.

So she doubles down on control… and it backfires in small ways.

---

## 4) Let her try to “solve” it with a test (and fail)

This is where your “tested and tested and tested again” becomes psychologically rich.

Celeste decides: *I will prove this is only utility.*

So she sets a test designed to demonstrate detachment:

* She assigns Charlie to someone else for a shift.
* Or she keeps him out of her orbit deliberately.
* Or she gives him a cold, minimal instruction set.

And then she discovers the result is…

Not relief.

It’s irritation. Distraction. A sense of the system running less smoothly.

And she hates that.

Not because she misses him romantically — but because she misses the **function of him** that has fused with the function of *her*.

That fusion is the inconvenient thing.

---

## 5) The “inconvenient” chapter beat I’d write next

If you want to cash this in immediately, the next chapter could be:

### Chapter: *Bias*

Celeste decides to “correct” her own developing bias by:

* putting Charlie on a different route, away from her, with clear instructions,
* telling herself it’s professional,
* then spending the day noticing all the small frictions that return in his absence.

Meanwhile, Charlie performs fine. That’s what makes it worse: she can’t justify pulling him back as “rescuing.”

She has to admit the truth:

She wants her standard carried *near her*.

Then end the chapter with a tiny, lethal line:

> It wasn’t that I needed him.
> It was that I didn’t like who I became when I didn’t have him.

That’s power. That’s character. That’s “inconvenient” made tangible.

---

If you’d like, I’ll write that chapter in Celeste POV: her trying to act like this is purely logistical, and the narration quietly betraying how much she’s now calibrated her world around the one person who treats her rules like gravity.

## Celeste — Bias

I told myself it was professional.

That was the first lie.

It wasn’t a flamboyant lie—nothing romantic, nothing tragic. Just the kind of lie clever people tell themselves when they don’t want to look directly at the shape of what they’ve made.

Wardrobe had survived the morning. The seam incident had been contained. The donor path had been managed. The day was holding.

Which meant it was the right time to make a correction.

Because if you only make corrections during crises, you’re not a strategist. You’re a firefighter with better vocabulary.

Charlie was at the mending table when I made the decision. Head down, shoulders relaxed in that new, almost offensive calm—like someone who had learned he wasn’t going to be randomly punished for existing.

He was stitching a loose sleeve seam on a footman’s shirt with meticulous patience. His hands moved like he trusted them.

That, too, was inconvenient.

I approached him with my clipboard and my neutral face.

“Charlie.”

He looked up immediately. Eyes steady. Waiting.

No apology. No flinch.

I still wasn’t used to it.

“Yes?”

“You’re switching route,” I said.

His brow furrowed. “Switching?”

“Yes,” I replied, as if it were obvious. “You’re on the eastern loop for the next two hours. Props and stage-left. They’re short a runner.”

He blinked once. Quickly. Then he nodded. “Okay.”

No protest. No panic. No relief-performance. Just acceptance.

That should have pleased me.

It didn’t.

It was too smooth, like a door that had been oiled so well you forgot it could ever stick.

I slid him a note card with the simplest instructions possible—words as tools:

**EAST LOOP:**
– check stage-left kit box (pins/thread)
– props: secure ties, fastenings
– report failures *only*
– if asked “who are you?” → *Wardrobe support. Talk to Celeste.*

Charlie read the card carefully, lips moving slightly.

Then he looked up. “Anything else?”

I wanted to say: *stay near me.*

I didn’t.

“No,” I said. “That’s it.”

He stood, pocketed the card, and moved toward the door with quiet competence.

At the threshold he paused, turning back just slightly—an instinctive check-in.

Not verbal. Not pleading.

I felt the moment hang.

I could have nodded. I could have dismissed him. I could have softened it with some unnecessary reassurance.

Instead, I gave him what I’d trained him to trust: certainty.

“Go,” I said.

He went.

The door closed.

Wardrobe returned to its hum.

Mara watched me from the cutting table like she was reading a document I hadn’t handed her.

“You sent him away,” she observed.

“I reassigned him,” I corrected, pen poised over the inventory.

“Mm,” Mara said. Then, with that infuriating accuracy that only bitter women possess, she added, “And you didn’t like it.”

I didn’t look up. “I’m fine.”

Mara snorted softly. “Sure.”

I wrote down a missing ribbon count and pretended the numbers mattered more than my own internal noise.

For the next ten minutes, they did.

Then the first friction arrived.

Not dramatic. Not a crisis. Just a small failure that would have been prevented if my system were in its newest configuration.

A performer—Elsie—appeared in the doorway with a grimace.

“Celeste,” she said, already halfway irritated, “my apron ties are slipping. I tied them twice and they still—”

I lifted a hand. “Hang it.”

She did.

I inspected the ties. The weave was worn. They needed reinforcement stitching or replacement. That wasn’t a “right now” fix. That was a *runner job*.

Normally, I would have said: *Charlie. Bring me tie tape. And check the spares.*

But Charlie was gone.

I could have asked Mara.

I did not ask Mara.

Not because Mara couldn’t do it. Because asking Mara would cost me more time in commentary than the task itself. Mara would make it a referendum on my judgement and her importance. That was her hobby.

So I did it myself.

I fetched tie tape. I reinforced the ties quickly. I logged the item. I sent Elsie back out.

It took four minutes.

Four minutes I hadn’t planned to spend.

Four minutes I wouldn’t have spent if my system were optimised.

I told myself it was irrelevant.

It wasn’t.

Two more small failures arrived back-to-back.

A cap pin shortage at stage-right. A snapped button on a waistcoat that should have been caught an hour earlier. A patron wandering into the corridor because no one had gently redirected him before he decided staff spaces were decorative.

Each time, the solution existed.

Each time, the solution was me.

I did not mind working. I minded inefficiency. I minded preventable drain.

By noon, my clipboard felt heavier not because it contained more tasks, but because I could feel my own attention being carved into smaller, cheaper pieces.

That was the first true symptom.

Not longing. Not romance. Not softness.

**Resource depletion.**

Mara made tea with the exaggerated slowness of someone enjoying the quiet breakdown of someone else’s certainty.

“You look tired,” she said.

I didn’t answer.

Mara glanced toward the door. “How’s your eastern loop experiment going?”

“It’s fine,” I said again.

Mara’s mouth curled. “Fine is what women say when they’re lying.”

I looked up sharply.

Mara held my gaze, unflinching. Then she added, almost casually, “Charlie keeps people off you.”

That was not an opinion. It was an observation. The kind that becomes a threat only if you refuse to acknowledge it.

I didn’t give her the pleasure of watching me react.

I returned to my inventory. “He’s useful.”

“Mm,” Mara said. “And you’ve made him think you’re… what, gravity?”

I froze for half a second.

Mara, of course, noticed.

She smiled without warmth. “Talia’s words. Not mine.”

That was the second symptom.

Other people’s awareness.

I should have been annoyed at Talia for talking. I wasn’t. Talia had done what women do when they’re checking safety—she’d talked to the woman who runs the standard.

Mara was the one turning it into a lever.

I didn’t respond.

Mara sipped her tea like she had all day.

A runner appeared at the door—one of the teenagers they’d hired for peak season, sweat already darkening his collar.

“Celeste,” he said, breathless. “Props says stage-left has a break. Something about a strap. And Dean’s looking for you.”

Of course he was.

“Tell Dean I’m busy,” I said.

The runner hesitated. “He said it’s urgent.”

“Everyone says that,” I replied. “Tell him to write it down.”

The runner scuttled away.

I turned back to Wardrobe—and found myself thinking, irritatingly, that Charlie would have taken that interaction and made it vanish. He would have delivered my boundary sentence and absorbed the resulting sulk without trying to soothe it. He would have returned with only what mattered.

He didn’t do emotional labour for men.

He didn’t demand emotional labour from me.

That was why he worked.

That was why he was dangerous.

I caught myself mid-thought and felt something like anger bloom in my chest.

Not at Charlie.

At myself.

Because the truth was simple and therefore unacceptable:

I had built part of my efficiency on him.

And now I was noticing the absence like a missing tool.

That’s what bias looks like in a strategist’s head: not desire, but distortion.

I stood. “Mara.”

Mara lifted her eyebrows. “Yes, boss?”

“Cover the room,” I said. “I’m going to stage-left.”

Mara’s smile sharpened. “Is that because you miss your little runner?”

I turned to her slowly.

The room quieted.

“Mara,” I said, voice level, “if you make this personal, you can go home.”

Mara’s smile vanished. She looked at me for a long beat, then nodded once, chastened in that reluctant way that means: *fine, you’re still in charge.*

“Go,” she said.

I left.

Outside, the Faire was louder—sun-hot, crowd-thick, full of people who believed their presence made them generous.

I walked quickly. Not running. Not flapping.

As I neared stage-left, I saw the knot of people: a prop crate open, a performer holding an accessory strap like it had betrayed her, Dean looming nearby with his favourite expression—concerned authority.

And then, just behind them, Charlie.

He was exactly where he should have been: slightly to the side, hands visible, attention on the strap, posture calm. He was speaking to the performer in a low voice, not soothing, not patronising.

Just clear.

“…If we anchor it here,” he was saying, “it stops pulling at the seam. But we need a pin and one stitch.”

The performer nodded, grateful. Dean looked irritated at being bypassed.

Charlie glanced up and saw me.

Something subtle happened in his face—not a smile, not a plea. A small recalibration, like a compass needle finding north.

He didn’t move toward me.

He waited for instruction.

The sight of that should have irritated me.

It didn’t.

It relieved me so sharply I nearly resented it.

I stepped in, took in the situation in half a second. “What’s broken?”

“The strap on the pouch,” the performer said. “It keeps slipping.”

Charlie held it up. “Anchor stitch here. Two minutes.”

Dean opened his mouth. “Celeste, I—”

I cut him off without looking at him. “Not now.”

Dean bristled, then swallowed it. He’d learned, at least, that my patience was not renewable.

I turned to Charlie. “Do it.”

Charlie nodded once. He didn’t look at the performer’s body. He didn’t look around. He focused on the strap as if it were the only thing in the world that mattered.

He pulled a needle from his kit, threaded it with hands that didn’t tremble, pinned the strap into the correct position, and stitched small and strong.

Two minutes.

Exactly.

He tested the tension, then handed it back.

“There,” he said.

The performer exhaled as if she’d been holding her breath for the entire season. “Thank you.”

Charlie nodded, contained. “You’re welcome.”

Dean stood there with his lanyard and his ego and nothing to do.

I looked at Charlie.

He looked at me.

No worship. No romance. Just that steady, inconvenient belief that my rules were real.

And in that instant, I understood the full extent of my own problem.

Charlie wasn’t attached to me because he was weak.

He was attached to me because I worked.

And—worse—

I worked better with him nearby.

That wasn’t love.

It was leverage.

It was bias.

It was a dependency loop wearing a sensible uniform.

I heard my own voice in my head, flat and annoyed:

*This is going to require management.*

I turned to Dean. “What did you want?”

Dean blinked, thrown off by the abruptness. “I—nothing. It’s… handled.”

“Yes,” I said. “It is.”

I turned back to Charlie and said, calmly, as if this were just another logistical adjustment:

“After this, you’re back on my shoulder.”

Charlie’s eyes widened slightly. Just a flicker.

Then he nodded once.

“Okay,” he said.

No question. No gratitude.

He didn’t know I’d just admitted something to myself I didn’t yet have language for.

He simply accepted the rule.

And as we walked back toward Wardrobe together, the Faire churning around us like an indifferent machine, I held my clipboard a little tighter—not because the tasks had increased, but because the truth had.

It wasn’t that I needed him.

It was that I didn’t like who I became when I didn’t have him.
