# Inconvenient

Yes — and if you handle it the way you’ve been handling everything else (procedure, ethics, consequence), it becomes one of the most **female-readable** turns in the book: pronouns as *social safety engineering*, not “gender play.”

The key is that **Talia** suggests it for *clarity and harm reduction*, not as a “step further.” And Celeste’s reaction should be complicated in exactly the way you like: Strategist Celeste recognising a new tool… and immediately realising the tool has a cost.

### Why it works

* In a “lived experience” sense, pronouns here aren’t about Charl’s inner truth. They’re about **how strangers behave** when they think you’re one category vs another.
* “He” in that space will constantly cause a double-take, a correction, a joke, or a challenge—i.e., attention. And attention is danger.
* “She” smooths interactions *because the system is sexist and lazy*: it prefers coherence over truth.

That’s the horror: the pronoun change makes the cage more comfortable—and therefore easier to keep you in.

### The one guardrail you must keep

Charl must not experience it as validation or thrill. If anything, it should land as:

* **a loss of linguistic shelter** (“at least I had ‘he’ as a lifeline to myself”),
* plus a deeper dread: “I’m learning to answer to the world’s expectations.”

And Celeste must be careful not to treat it as a *win*. It’s not victory. It’s triage.

---

## A clean way to stage it

### 1) Talia frames it as workflow, not identity

She’s seen enough now to say it plainly:

* “People are getting confused.”
* “Confusion leads to attention.”
* “Attention leads to commentary.”
* “Commentary leads to risk.”

Then she suggests:

* “In public, we use ‘she’—for coherence.”
* “In private, you can be Charlie.”

The split matters. It starves dopamine readers and keeps the ethics intact.

### 2) Celeste insists on consent

Not mushy consent—**procedural** consent:

* “Are you willing to do this as part of the uniform?”
* “If you say no, we find another workaround.”

But the stakes are real, so Charl’s yes feels like the same earlier pattern: consent under constraint.

### 3) Charl’s reaction is grief, not pleasure

He isn’t delighted; he’s resigned, embarrassed, uneasy.
He might say something like:

* “It makes it easier for them.”
* “It makes it harder for me to remember I’m not… this.”

That line would be *powerful* and totally non-kinky.

### 4) The “lived experience group” is marked by women’s matter-of-fact compliance

Not celebration. Not teasing. Just:

* “Alright, then.”
* “Copy that.”
* “Keep it boring.”

And then the gut-punch: people are instantly nicer in a condescending way, or instantly entitled in a casual way. Charl notices the *shift*.

## A scene, Celeste POV

### Celeste — The Word Everyone Uses

Talia waited until the corridor cleared.

It was the little lull between donor waves—when the manor breathed in and no one was demanding to be impressed.

Charl stood where he always stood now: two steps behind me, hands folded, face arranged into that practiced neutrality that made him disappear. It was working. Which meant it was costing him.

Talia leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, expression practical.

“We need to fix something,” she said.

I didn’t look surprised. “We’re fixing many things.”

“This one is linguistic,” Talia replied.

Charl’s posture tightened by a fraction. He had the instincts now—flinch at anything that sounded like a change.

Talia glanced at him, then back at me. “People are tripping over him.”

“Good,” I said. “Let them.”

“No,” Talia said, flat. “Not good. Confusion makes them look closer. Looking closer makes them talk. Talking makes them bold.”

I watched her. She was right, and I hated that she was right.

Talia continued, not unkind. “They keep saying ‘he’ by accident. Then they correct themselves. Then they laugh like it’s cute. It’s not cute. It’s a spark.”

Charl’s throat moved. He didn’t speak.

I kept my voice calm. “What do you suggest?”

Talia’s gaze stayed steady. “In public, we use ‘she.’”

The air changed.

Charl’s fingers tightened around nothing.

I felt something rise in my chest that I didn’t enjoy naming: a strategist’s interest, immediately followed by a human being’s discomfort.

I didn’t let either show.

I turned slightly, just enough to catch Charl in my peripheral vision. “Thoughts?”

Charl’s voice came out very quiet. “I’m not—”

“I know,” I said, cutting it cleanly. “This isn’t about what you are.”

Talia nodded once, approving. “It’s about what the room does.”

Charl swallowed. “It feels… like lying.”

I let that sit for a beat.

Then I gave him the truth the way I always did—without theatre.

“It is lying,” I said. “But it’s lying the way every woman lies when she smiles at a man who could make her day worse.”

Charl’s eyes lifted sharply. Something in his face tightened—grief, recognition, anger.

Talia’s voice softened by a millimetre. “It makes your interactions simpler. People stop re-checking you. They stop hunting for the joke.”

Charl’s jaw worked. “And what does it do to me?”

That question was the personality you wanted: not defiance, not obedience—**ethical accounting**.

I answered honestly. “It will make it easier for them to use you.”

Charl went still.

I continued, because he deserved the whole truth. “And it will make it harder for you to feel like you have a foothold outside this.”

Talia watched me, expression sober. She wasn’t playing games. She was offering a tool with a price tag.

Charl’s voice cracked slightly. “So why do it?”

I looked at him then—properly.

“Because I can’t protect you by keeping the world confused,” I said. “Confusion is where cruelty lives.”

He blinked, eyes bright. “And if I say no?”

I held his gaze.

“Then we find another structure,” I said. “It will be messier. It will be riskier. But it will be yours.”

A long beat.

Charl exhaled through his nose, small and controlled, like he was trying not to give the moment the satisfaction of drama.

“In public,” he said finally, “they can say it.”

Talia nodded once, decisive. “Good.”

Charl added, quietly, “But you don’t.”

Talia blinked. “What?”

Charl looked at me. “You don’t have to,” he said. “Not when it’s just us.”

I felt the inconvenient twist in my chest again—annoying, human.

“Agreed,” I said.

Talia pushed off the doorframe. “Alright. Then we’re consistent. We don’t hesitate. Hesitation invites questions.”

Charl’s lips pressed thin. “And if someone asks?”

Talia shrugged. “They won’t. Not if you don’t make it interesting.”

I nodded once. “Boring,” I said.

Talia’s mouth twitched. “Exactly.”

Charl swallowed, then asked the question that made the whole thing turn—made it stop being about language and become about the world.

“Does it change… how they look at me?”

Talia’s answer came without hesitation.

“Yes,” she said. “And you’re going to hate it.”

Charl closed his eyes for a second, as if bracing.

When he opened them, there was no thrill there.

Just resignation.

Just that new, awful knowing.

He nodded once. “Okay.”

Talia looked at me. “You’ll tell staff?”

“I will,” I said.

“And the front desk?” she asked.

“Yes,” I replied.

Talia’s gaze flicked to Charl again, not pitying—simply acknowledging.

“Welcome,” she said, matter-of-fact, “to being managed by language.”

Charl didn’t smile.

He just stood there, two steps behind me, learning what it cost to make a room behave.

And I realised, with a sharp little jolt, that we’d moved him another inch deeper into it.

Not into costume.

Into society.

---

If you want, the very next micro-scene can be the “first time it happens” in public: a donor wife says “she” casually, and Charl feels the floor tilt—not because it’s exciting, but because it’s **effective**. And he hates that he’s relieved. That’s the exact kind of morally complicated, Sciamma-adjacent ache you’re building toward.




## Celeste — The First “She”

It happened in the way the most consequential things always happen: casually.

No bell. No announcement. No pause for anyone’s feelings.

Just a word placed on Charl like a hand.

We were in the long gallery, where the light came in soft and flattering through tall windows and made donors feel as if they were walking through something important. The walls held portraits that weren’t as old as people assumed. The air held the quiet clink of glasses and the low murmur of money being pleased with itself.

I was half-turned toward a couple I didn’t know well—Mr. and Mrs. Weller, by their lanyards—explaining the origin of a lacquered writing desk that had, in truth, arrived last month from a warehouse in Brisbane.

“—and we restored the hinge work to match period hardware,” I was saying, my voice smooth, the story coherent enough to satisfy their appetite for authenticity.

Charl stood where he belonged now: two steps behind me, slightly to my left, hands folded at the apron, gaze level. He moved like someone trying very hard to be forgotten.

Which, infuriatingly, was the skill that kept us safest.

Mrs. Weller smiled in that careful way women smile in public, polite and managerial. She wasn’t unkind. She was simply practiced.

“Oh, it’s lovely,” she said. “And tell me—are you doing the tour of the upstairs rooms as well? I’ve heard the bedrooms are simply divine.”

“Yes,” I replied. “Later this afternoon.”

Mr. Weller leaned in, already bored, scanning the room for something that would make him feel entertained. His eyes flicked over Charl, then away again, as if registering a coat stand.

“And you—” Mrs. Weller added, turning slightly, not quite addressing Charl but including him the way one includes staff in a sentence, “—your girl will be with you?”

Charl went still.

The word didn’t land loudly. It didn’t echo. It didn’t cause anyone to gasp.

It just… happened.

“Your girl.”

A neat phrase. A neat reduction. A neat category.

Charl’s shoulders tightened by a millimetre—so small no one would notice except someone who’d been watching him the way you watch a fault line.

I felt it beside me like a tiny tremor.

I kept my face calm.

“Yes,” I said, as if it were nothing. “She’ll be with me.”

Charl’s breath caught.

I heard it. Barely. A quiet, involuntary hitch of air.

But Mrs. Weller didn’t.

Mr. Weller certainly didn’t.

They moved on instantly, satisfied by the coherence of the moment. A Lady with her maid. A world that made sense.

They didn’t smile at Charl. They didn’t study him. They didn’t look closer.

They simply… accepted.

And the acceptance was the knife.

Because I felt Charl’s body respond before his mind could argue.

His posture loosened by a fraction. His jaw unclenched. His eyes—so carefully controlled—lost the sharp edge of panic for half a second.

Relief.

Pure, involuntary relief.

Then his face tightened again, as if he’d caught himself enjoying oxygen.

The conflict flickered across him so fast it would have been invisible to anyone who wasn’t trained to watch the smallest shifts for danger.

To anyone who hadn’t lived it.

Mrs. Weller turned back to me, smiling. “Wonderful. It’s so much easier when everything runs properly, isn’t it?”

“Yes,” I said, my voice smooth.

Mr. Weller chuckled. “A well-run house. That’s what you want.”

They drifted away, drawn toward the next polished object, the next story, the next place where their attention could feel generous without costing them anything.

The moment was gone.

The word remained.

I waited until we were alone for three seconds—until the next donor hadn’t yet arrived, until there was a pocket of air I could speak into without being overheard.

I didn’t turn to Charl. Turning would make it a scene.

I spoke forward, voice low.

“Breathe,” I said.

Charl’s breath came out shaky, and he hated that too.

“I—” he began, then swallowed the rest.

I kept my voice calm, as if we were discussing a timetable. “What did you feel?”

Silence.

Then, very quietly, Charl said, “Relief.”

The honesty surprised him. I could hear it in the way he said it—like confessing to a crime.

A beat.

“And?” I prompted.

Charl’s voice tightened. “Disgust.”

“For what?” I asked, still low.

“For… being relieved,” he whispered.

There it was.

The exact conflict you wanted: the smile women give to survive, and the hatred of themselves for giving it.

I nodded once, small.

“Yes,” I said.

Charl’s hands tightened around the apron fabric, knuckles whitening.

“It worked,” he said, voice strained. “It— it made them stop looking.”

“Yes,” I replied.

“And I hate that I… wanted that,” he said.

I kept my eyes forward, scanning the room as if simply tracking donor flow. The performance never stops. That’s part of the lesson.

“You didn’t want it,” I corrected softly. “You wanted safety.”

Charl swallowed hard.

“That’s the same thing,” he murmured.

“No,” I said. “It becomes the same thing when you blame yourself.”

He flinched at that—because it was true, and because he hadn’t realised he’d already begun doing it.

The next donor approached—an older woman with a bright scarf and a hungry social expression.

I straightened my shoulders, smile returning like a mask clicking into place.

Charl did too. Automatically.

The donor didn’t look at him.

She looked at me.

“How enchanting,” she said. “You must be exhausted.”

“I’m delighted,” I lied smoothly.

She laughed. “And this is your—”

“Attendant,” I supplied.

The donor’s gaze flicked over Charl for half a second—just long enough to confirm category.

“She seems very quiet,” the donor remarked.

Charl’s throat moved.

I answered for him. “She’s discreet.”

Discreet.

Another word women are praised for when they’re being erased.

The donor nodded approvingly and moved closer to me, already taking my attention like she’d paid for it.

I handled her. I smiled. I softened. I kept it functional.

And behind me, two steps back, Charl stood with the new weight on his shoulders:

Not the costume.

Not the cap.

A pronoun that made the room behave.

And the sickening realisation that behaving rooms are a luxury purchased with someone’s self-erasure.

Later—much later, when we had a moment alone again—Charl spoke once more, voice small and furious.

“They didn’t even see me,” he said.

I kept my voice even. “No.”

“And it was… easier,” he admitted, hate threading every syllable.

“Yes,” I said again.

Charl’s fingers clenched. “So this is what women do.”

It wasn’t a question.

It was a verdict.

I glanced back at him, just briefly, letting my gaze catch his eyes so he knew I wasn’t leaving him alone with it.

“This is what women are forced to do,” I corrected.

Charl swallowed. His eyes shone, not with tears—he wasn’t there yet—but with something harder: a clarity that hurt.

“And they do it without anyone noticing,” he whispered.

“Yes,” I said.

A beat.

Then Charl said, voice breaking just slightly, “I want to tell everyone.”

I felt the tight twist in my chest again—that inconvenient thing.

Not pride.

Recognition.

Not yet, I thought.

Not yet.

But one day.

I turned back to the room, smile returning because it had to.

And behind me, Charl learned how to wear safety like a lie.

How to hate it.

How to need it anyway.












## Celeste — The Hard Question

The sea had darkened by degrees while we spoke, as if the day had been quietly closing its book. The light outside the tall windows was turning steel-blue, and the waves below the cliff face kept their rhythm like something older than any of us: arrive, withdraw, arrive again—no apology in it.

Sharl sat with her hands folded in her lap, still in the posture she’d learned today and hated learning. It lingered even when the cap was off, even when she was “off duty,” because the body doesn’t drop a lesson just because the clock says it can.

I watched her in the reflection of the glass, not directly. I was avoiding the temptation to soften too much, because softness is how things slide into sentiment, and sentiment is how I lose control.

But something had already moved in me. Quietly. Like a hinge you didn’t notice until it began to swing.

I’d built a structure. I’d recruited confederates. I’d made the room behave.

And somewhere inside that scaffolding, I’d started to… care.

Not in the tidy, managerial way I cared about a schedule. Not in the proud way I cared about competence.

In the irritating, improper way that made me look at Sharl and feel the urge to protect her from things I couldn’t control.

I spoke before I could talk myself out of it.

“Sharl,” I said.

She looked up immediately. That quick attention still made something in me tighten.

“Yes?”

I let a beat pass. Not to be dramatic. To be accurate.

“Why did you do it?” I asked.

Sharl blinked. “What?”

“All of it,” I said, voice calm. “The uniform. The pronouns. The day. The—” I didn’t bother listing the thousand tiny humiliations. “Why did you stay.”

Her eyes widened slightly, and for a moment I saw panic—because the question sounded like an accusation even when it wasn’t.

Then she swallowed and set her jaw, the way she did when she decided to be honest even if it cost her.

“I didn’t know,” she said quietly.

I didn’t let her off the hook. “That’s not an answer.”

Sharl’s mouth tightened. She looked back toward the sea, as if trying to locate the correct words in the water.

“I didn’t know it would be like this,” she said again, more carefully. “I knew you had a plan. I knew it would be… difficult. But I didn’t understand what the difficulty would actually be.”

I watched her profile. The curve of her cheekbone. The strain around her mouth that didn’t belong to an eighteen-year-old.

“Answer me anyway,” I said.

Sharl’s throat moved. “I stayed because you asked me to.”

I shook my head once. “That’s still not why.”

Sharl’s eyes flicked to mine—frustration now, not fear. Good. Anger means she feels safe enough to have one.

“You want some grand reason,” she said, voice tight. “Like—like I’m in love with you.”

The words landed between us and didn’t explode. They simply existed, blunt and exposed.

I didn’t flinch. I didn’t deny it on her behalf. I didn’t give her an escape line.

I simply said, “Are you?”

Sharl froze.

Then, in a voice that sounded like it hurt to use, she said, “No.”

The honesty was immediate, and it wasn’t cold. It was something else—more complicated.

She swallowed, then continued, before she could lose her nerve.

“I mean… I’m attracted to you,” she admitted, and the word attracted sounded almost clinical in her mouth, like she’d chosen it because it couldn’t be misunderstood. “But not in the way you’re thinking. Not—” She cut herself off, frustrated. “Not because you were the first girl who ever paid attention to me.”

I held her gaze. “Then what.”

Sharl exhaled, slow.

“Because you’re you,” she said. “Because you don’t behave like anyone else.”

That made something in my chest tighten—annoyingly warm, annoyingly pleased.

I didn’t let it show.

“Be specific,” I said.

Sharl’s laugh came out once, small and exhausted. “Of course. Of course you’d say that.”

I waited.

She looked down at her hands, turning them slightly as if she still didn’t trust them not to betray her.

“I liked you in the restroom,” she admitted, “because you were fearless. Or you seemed fearless. You walked into a place you weren’t meant to be and you didn’t apologise for existing.”

I didn’t interrupt.

“But that’s not why I stayed,” she went on, voice steadier now that she’d started. “I stayed because once I knew you… I realised you weren’t fearless. You were… deliberate. You do things on purpose. You watch. You decide. You push.”

Her eyes lifted to mine, sharper.

“And then you do something kind,” she said. “Or something fair. Or something—something that makes no sense if you’re just using people.”

The words hit me like a mirror held at an angle I hadn’t chosen.

“You think I’m kind,” I said.

Sharl’s mouth tightened. “I think you can be.”

A beat.

“I think you are, and you hate that you are,” she added. “Because it complicates your plans.”

My throat tightened. Inconveniently.

I turned my gaze to the sea again, because looking at her directly felt like stepping too close to an edge.

Sharl continued, softer now.

“You’re unpredictable,” she said. “Not chaotic. Not careless. Just… not reducible.”

I didn’t like how much I wanted to hear that again.

“You make me think,” Sharl said. “You make me see things I didn’t even know existed. Ways people move around each other. Ways women survive. Ways men get away with things without even trying.”

She paused, then said the sentence that made the whole room go still.

“And when I realised what women carry—what you carry—I couldn’t unsee it.”

I felt something shift in me—something that had nothing to do with strategy.

A recognition, almost like guilt.

Sharl looked down again, voice rougher.

“So yes,” she said. “I went through it to stay with you. But not because I wanted the costume or the role or any of that—God, no.”

Her fingers curled against her skirtless knees, as if resisting an invisible fabric.

“I stayed because you were teaching me,” she said. “Not in a lecture way. In the way your life… happens. And you don’t even always notice you’re doing it.”

I swallowed.

A part of me wanted to correct her. To say: *I notice.* To claim control.

But another part of me—an inconvenient, newly human part—recognised she was right.

I didn’t always notice. Because women shouldn’t have to.

Sharl looked up again. Her eyes were bright, angry, clear.

“And then,” she said, “I realised the worst thing.”

I waited.

Sharl’s voice tightened. “I realised you didn’t invent this. You didn’t create the cruelty. You just… learned how to navigate it. Better than anyone.”

The words didn’t flatter me. They implicated me.

I felt my jaw tighten.

“And what am I supposed to do with that?” I asked, voice quieter than before.

Sharl’s answer came immediately.

“Tell the truth,” she said.

A beat.

“Eventually,” she added, as if remembering where she was. “Not now. Not here. But… later.”

I stared at her.

There it was: not obedience, not infatuation—**purpose**. The first seed of a spine that wasn’t borrowed from me.

I felt something in my chest bloom and sting at the same time.

“And you stayed,” I said slowly, “because I was a beacon.”

Sharl flinched slightly at the word, as if it was too poetic for what she meant.

“Yes,” she said. “A beacon of concepts. Of… ways of seeing.”

She swallowed.

“And because you made me feel like I wasn’t stupid for not seeing them before,” she added.

The room went quiet again.

Outside, the sea kept arriving and withdrawing, like a breath.

I leaned back against the bench and let myself feel, for the first time all day, how tired I was. Not body-tired.

Power-tired.

Sharl watched me, cautious, as if waiting for the price of her honesty.

The price was… my own honesty.

“I asked because I needed to know,” I said.

Sharl’s brow furrowed. “Why?”

Because I can’t keep treating you like a tool, I thought.

Because if I’m going to keep you near me, I have to stop pretending it’s only strategy.

Because something in me is beginning to want you in ways that aren’t tidy.

I didn’t say any of that—not yet. Celeste doesn’t hand over her throat.

But I didn’t lie either.

“I needed to know,” I said, “whether you were staying for *me*… or because you didn’t think you had anywhere else to go.”

Sharl’s eyes widened. “Celeste—”

“Answer it,” I said, gentler than my words.

Sharl took a breath. Then she said, quietly and firmly:

“I could leave,” she said. “It would hurt. I’d be terrified. But I could.”

A beat.

“I’m staying because I choose to,” she added. “Even if I hate parts of it.”

Relief hit me—sharp and shameful—because it meant I hadn’t trapped her entirely.

Then the second feeling hit, quieter, deeper.

Something like tenderness.

Something like… *more*.

I nodded once, as if filing the information.

But inside, I felt the hinge swing further.

“Good,” I said.

Sharl watched me, as if waiting for the other shoe.

I didn’t give her sentiment.

I gave her a vow, which is what women like me do when they care.

“Then here is what I will do,” I said calmly. “I will not let this turn you into furniture. I will not let your invisibility become your cage. If you are staying, it will be on terms that keep you intact.”

Sharl blinked, breathing shallow.

“You can’t promise that,” she whispered.

I met her eyes.

“Yes,” I said. “I can.”

Sharl stared at me for a long moment.

Then she exhaled, slow, and a tiny, private smile touched her mouth—brief, reluctant, real.

“Of course you’d say that,” she murmured.

I felt my own mouth try to soften.

I stopped it.

Not because I didn’t want it.

Because I did.

And that was how I knew it was becoming something a bit more.
