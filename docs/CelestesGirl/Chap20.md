# # Scene 20 — “Terms” (Celeste POV)

Mara didn’t romanticise the museum run.

She laid it out the way she laid out everything: as facts that would either be carried properly, or would break someone.

“Thirty-six units,” she said, and tapped the order sheet once. “That means we stop behaving like a clever pocket of talent and start behaving like a shop.”

Lauren had brought a roll of butcher’s paper and a marker. She unrolled it on the cutting table with a quiet competence that felt, oddly, like a spell. Columns appeared. Headings. Boxes. A place for reality to sit.

**CUT**
**SEW**
**HARDWARE**
**FINISH**
**QC**
**PACK**
**PICKUP / DELIVERY**

Charlie watched the grid form as if it were comfort in disguise. He stood close enough to see, far enough not to intrude. Chalk dust on his fingers. The mild, contained intensity of a boy who had discovered that order could make him brave without requiring him to be loud.

Sarah leaned on the shelving, arms folded, expression set to *fine, impress me.*

Mara’s finger moved down the list.

“Hardware packs get made first,” she said. “Grommets counted. Tape cut. Boning sorted by stiffness.” She nodded once at Lauren. “Label it.”

Lauren’s marker squeaked as she wrote, warm voice, sharp mind.

“Hardware packs. Like meal prep,” she said, as if explaining to a child who’d asked why adults didn’t starve. “You do it once, cleanly, and then you stop bleeding time every time you need a grommet.”

Mara didn’t smile, but her shoulders loosened the tiniest fraction. Approval.

Charlie made a small sound—half agreement, half relief.

“QC checklist,” Mara continued. “Nothing leaves the building without it.”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “We’re doing paperwork now.”

Mara looked at her. “We’ve been doing paperwork. We’re just calling it by its name.”

Lauren’s marker paused. She added another box at the side.

**TIME LOST:**

Mara’s eyes flicked to it. “What’s that.”

Lauren’s tone stayed conversational, but there was steel under it.

“That’s the bit you never count,” Lauren said. “The bit that kills you.”

She looked around the table—not accusing, not sentimental. Adult.

“Before anyone starts volunteering extra hours,” she said, “I want to know how many hours we’re already losing to friction.”

Charlie blinked. “Friction.”

Lauren nodded. “Commute. Waiting on deliveries. Re-doing things because the right tape wasn’t where it should be. Starting late because someone’s brain is fried.”

Sarah scoffed. “Oh my god.”

Lauren turned her head toward Sarah, still warm.

“You can scoff,” she said. “Or you can tell me how many minutes it takes you to find grommets when they’ve migrated.”

Sarah opened her mouth, then shut it again, because the answer was: too many.

Lauren looked at Charlie.

“How long does it take you to get here?” she asked.

Charlie hesitated, as if time were a personal weakness.

“Forty-five minutes,” he said finally. “Sometimes more.”

Lauren didn’t react with pity. She reacted with arithmetic.

“Each way.”

Charlie nodded.

Lauren did the numbers silently with her eyes.

“An hour and a half a day,” she said. “Seven and a half hours a week. That’s a whole workday of your life spent… travelling to the work.”

Charlie’s face shifted—surprise, then a kind of humiliation, as if he’d been caught being inefficient.

Mara didn’t let him turn it into shame.

“That’s not his fault,” Mara said. “That’s geography.”

Lauren nodded. “Sure. And we can’t argue with geography. We can only choose what we do about it.”

Her gaze moved to me.

“Celeste,” she said, as if this were the obvious next line in the spreadsheet, “how are you going to do an MBA while we scale a shop and keep the place clean?”

I felt my irritation rise—not at her, at the world. At the way ambition always seemed to come with a price tag and a time tax.

“I’m not doing it on noise and buses and guesswork,” I said. “I’m not doing it tired.”

Mara’s eyes stayed on mine. I didn’t have to justify the tone. She spoke fluent irritation. She used it too.

“Then we remove friction,” Mara said, flat.

The sentence landed in my chest with a peculiar relief. Not comfort. Permission to be strategic.

Charlie’s eyes flicked between us, trying to follow the move. I could almost see him building a romantic narrative out of it, the way his mind tried to make meaning:

*Remove friction. Make life easier. Provide.*

He didn’t say it. He didn’t need to. I saw it anyway.

Lauren saw it too. She didn’t pounce. She simply laid guardrails down like tape lines on a floor.

“Logistics,” she said, warm and firm. “Not a love story. Logistics.”

Mara nodded, once. “Exactly.”

I looked at Charlie.

“Do you have a lease?” I asked him.

He blinked. “Yes.”

“How long left?”

“Six months.” He swallowed. “Why?”

Because I can’t stand waste. Because I can’t stand chaos. Because I can feel the future trying to happen and I’d rather write it down than be dragged by it.

I didn’t say any of that. I gave him the clean version.

“I have a spare room,” I said. “Nearer to here. Quieter. If you move, your commute drops to ten minutes.”

Charlie stared at me as if he’d misheard.

Sarah made a small, disbelieving sound. “You’re what?”

Lauren’s marker squeaked as she wrote a new box on the butcher’s paper.

**HOUSING / ROUTINE:**

Mara didn’t look at Sarah. “Colleague,” she said, automatically.

Sarah shut her mouth. It didn’t mean she approved. It meant she understood the rules of the room.

Charlie’s throat moved. “You mean… live with you.”

“I mean rent a room,” I said, and I kept my voice calm on purpose. Not cold. Exact.

Lauren, warm: “Separate rooms. Rent. Terms. House policy.”

Mara, flat: “Rent doesn’t buy access.”

Charlie flinched at that, as if he’d been accused of something he hadn’t done. Mara didn’t soften the line. She wasn’t accusing him. She was protecting everyone.

Including him.

Charlie looked down at his hands. Chalk dust. Tape residue. The evidence of work.

“I wouldn’t—” he began.

“I know,” I said. And I meant it. “But we’re not building a system that relies on people *being good.* We’re building one that stays clean even when people get confused.”

His eyes flicked up. Confused, and a little hurt.

Lauren stepped in with warmth that didn’t compromise the standard.

“It’s not personal,” she said. “It’s grown-up. You’ll actually like it, because you won’t have to guess.”

Charlie swallowed.

“What are the terms?” he asked quietly.

That line—*terms*—was the rung I hadn’t realised we were climbing today.

Mara looked satisfied, in the way she looked satisfied when a stitch finally behaved.

Lauren pulled a fresh sheet from her stack, as if she’d been waiting for this exact moment.

“Okay,” she said, cheerful in the way competent people get when they finally see a solvable problem. “We write it.”

She drew headings without asking anyone’s permission.

**RENT:**
**BILLS:**
**QUIET HOURS:**
**STUDY HOURS (SACRED):**
**CHORES:**
**GUESTS:**
**PRIVACY:**
**CONFLICT RULE:**
**EXIT CLAUSE:**

Sarah let out a low whistle. “Bloody hell.”

Mara glanced at her. “That’s what adulthood looks like.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. “It looks like paperwork.”

“It looks like freedom,” Lauren corrected, still warm. She stapled the page to a clipboard. “Same rule as here,” she said. “If it isn’t written, it isn’t real.”

Charlie stood very still, staring at the page. Not panicked. Thinking.

“Study hours sacred,” he repeated, softly.

“Yes,” I said. “If I’m doing this, I’m doing it properly.”

His eyes moved down the list. “Privacy.”

“Yes,” Mara said, before I could. “Non-negotiable.”

Charlie nodded, once. He wasn’t smiling. But something in his posture eased, the way it eased when the ledger gave him rails.

Lauren looked up at me.

“Celeste,” she said, warm, “you set the parameters. It’s your house.”

I picked up the pen.

I didn’t hesitate.

Rent number. Bills split. Quiet hours. No hovering. No improvising “help.” Guests by agreement. Study hours written like a boundary you could build a life against.

Charlie watched my handwriting as if it were a map.

When I finished, I slid the page toward him.

“Read it,” I said. “If you agree, you sign. If you don’t, you don’t.”

Charlie read it slowly. Carefully. As if the paper might bruise.

When he got to the bottom, he paused at the exit clause.

“What’s that?” he asked.

Lauren’s tone stayed light.

“That’s the part where nobody gets trapped,” she said. “Thirty days’ notice. Clean separation. No drama.”

Charlie nodded. He put his name on the page with a steadiness that told me he understood what he was doing.

Not moving in as a boyfriend.

Moving in as infrastructure.

Mara tapped the signed sheet once.

“Good,” she said. “Now we can work without wasting human life on travel.”

Sarah stared at the paper, then at me. Her expression was complicated—judgement trying to find purchase, failing, reforming into something more honest.

“So,” she said finally, blunt, “you’re not doing this because you fancy him — you’re doing it because you’d feel safe?”

I met her gaze.

“I’m doing it because I’m not letting my ambition be eaten by chaos,” I said. “And because he’s useful.”

Charlie’s ears coloured. He didn’t look offended.

He looked… relieved.

Lauren laughed softly. Not at him. With the moment.

Mara didn’t laugh.

She turned back to the butcher’s paper and tapped the production grid.

“Right,” she said. “Now that we’ve removed a friction point, we accept the museum run.”

Charlie picked up his chalk again.

Not bravely.

Not romantically.

Just… as if the world had finally started making sense in the only language that mattered here.

Work.

And terms.
