# Scene 33



## From 25.01.05

## Following Mum’s Advice

Celeste closed her laptop with the careful finality of someone sealing a file.

“That’s me,” she said, voice slightly hoarse from reading too long. “Brain’s done.”

Charli, who had been tidying without meaning to—mug to sink, pens back in their cup, her highlighters aligned like they were part of the furniture—paused mid-motion. He’d been waiting for that sentence as if it were permission. He’d been waiting for it all evening.

Because once she finished studying, there would be no more *obvious* reason for him to speak.

No seam to blame. No inventory to check. No “quick question” about shipping.

Just… him, and what he’d promised himself he would do.

Celeste stood and stretched, rolling her shoulders, her hair falling forward. She caught it back with a clip—quick, practiced, unromantic. Then she walked toward the bathroom.

Charli’s throat tightened.

This, apparently, was the moment his mother had decided would be good for him. As if Lauren had sat at her kitchen table, the way she did when she was building a plan, and said: *This is how you learn to stop treating yourself like an afterthought. You ask the standard-holder. You show you heard it.*

He followed her into the hallway at a respectful distance, like he wasn’t stalking her, like he hadn’t been rehearsing a single sentence in his head for hours.

Celeste turned on the bathroom light. The soft bright rectangle made her look even more awake than she had any right to be after an entire night of study. She began her routine automatically—hands washed, hair clipped back properly, sleeves rolled.

Charli hovered in the doorway, suddenly aware he was blocking it. He shifted to the side.

Celeste glanced at him in the mirror.

“You okay?” she asked, casually.

He nodded too quickly. “Yep.”

She didn’t push. She never did. That was part of what made her terrifying and safe at the same time: Celeste didn’t hunt for weakness. She made a space where you could volunteer it without being punished.

She reached for a small bottle, unscrewed it, dispensed a neat amount into her palm. The scent in the air was clean and faint and adult—nothing sugary, nothing loud.

Charli watched her apply it with economy. He watched her face as if it were a process he could learn, because he learned everything that way: as a sequence of steps.

His mother’s voice rose again, absurdly vivid.

*Ask Celeste what moisturiser she uses.*

He opened his mouth.

Nothing came out.

He swallowed, tried again.

“Celeste?”

She paused, hands mid-motion, and looked at him properly—not in the mirror now, but turning her head just enough to meet his eyes.

“Yes?”

His heart hammered in that humiliating way it did when he wasn’t allowed to hide behind usefulness.

He forced the words out before he could lose them.

“What… moisturiser do you use?”

Celeste blinked.

It was a tiny thing—barely a reaction—but it was enough. A fraction of a second where her expression went blank, then sharpened, as if her mind had just opened a drawer she hadn’t expected to.

Charli felt heat crawl up his neck.

“I mean—” he began, immediately panicking at the silence. “You don’t have to— I just— Mum said—”

He stopped, mortified, because he’d just admitted it: this wasn’t his clever thought. It was borrowed.

Celeste’s eyebrows lifted.

“Mum said?” she repeated, carefully.

Charli’s hands came up, helpless. “Not— not like that. She didn’t—” He shook his head, trying to untangle it. “She just… she said I should… take care. Like, basic. And you— you notice things. Because you have standards. And I’m not—”

He faltered into quiet.

Celeste stared at him for a beat too long.

Then something in her face shifted.

Not amusement. Not mockery.

Recognition.

Charli didn’t know what to do with it. He suddenly wanted to run back into the kitchen and hide behind a tea towel.

Celeste turned off the tap. She dried her hands slowly, as if she needed the time to arrange herself.

And then she said, softly, with a strange steadiness:

“Lauren.”

It wasn’t a question. It was an answer.

Charli blinked. “What?”

Celeste’s eyes flicked, just once, toward the hallway—toward the memory of Lauren standing in this very house weeks ago, offering that measured look and that small nod, like a woman signing off on a standard.

Celeste had thought, then, that Lauren had been assessing *her*.

Now Celeste understood.

Lauren had been handing her a baton.

You’re the one he’ll listen to now. Don’t waste it.

Celeste’s throat tightened with something she didn’t let show. Her discipline held, but only just. She turned back to him, expression composed.

“Okay,” she said. “Thank you for asking.”

Charli blinked again, surprised by the gentleness. “You’re… not weirded out?”

Celeste’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile.

“I’m a little taken aback,” she said honestly. “But I’m not weirded out.”

He exhaled, as if his lungs had been locked for an hour.

Celeste set the towel down, then reached into the cabinet and pulled out two things: a small, plain cleanser, and a moisturiser in a simple pump bottle—nothing fancy-looking, nothing performative.

“This one,” she said, holding up the bottle. “Unscented. It does the job.”

Charli nodded, absorbing it like a spec sheet.

Celeste studied him for a moment. She didn’t look at him like a project. She looked at him like a person trying to learn a new standard without being laughed at.

Then she tipped her head toward the sink.

“Do you want me to show you a basic routine?” she asked.

Charli froze.

“You mean… now?”

“Yes,” Celeste said, as if this were the only sensible time. “Two minutes. You’ve been working in steam and cloth dust and detergent all week. Your skin’s dry. Your hands are dry. Your face—” She paused, and her gaze flicked briefly to his jaw. “—looks tight.”

He felt himself flush again, but this time it wasn’t humiliation. It was something gentler. Relief, maybe. Because she was making it practical. Because she wasn’t making him feel ridiculous.

He remembered Lauren’s voice: *Basic. Maintenance. Meet her world halfway.*

Charli’s voice came out small.

“Okay,” he said. “If that’s… normal.”

Celeste’s eyes held his.

“It’s normal in my house,” she said. “And it’s normal for someone who wants to be taken seriously.”

Charli nodded, and the nod was shy, but it was also… willing.

Celeste stepped aside and gestured him forward with a simple tilt of her hand—no flourish, no coyness. Command without cruelty.

“Come here,” she said.

Charli approached the sink like it might explode.

Celeste dispensed cleanser into his palm.

“Wash with this,” she said. “Not soap. Soap strips everything and then your skin overcompensates. Just this. Gentle. Use lukewarm water.”

He did as he was told.

Celeste watched with the same attention she watched a garment test: how he moved, where he hesitated, what he did automatically, what he didn’t know yet.

“Rinse,” she said.

He rinsed.

She handed him a towel.

“Don’t rub,” she said. “Pat.”

Charli patted his face, feeling absurd. Then—strangely—less absurd, because she wasn’t treating it as absurd.

Celeste pumped moisturiser onto her fingertips and held her hand out.

“May I?” she asked.

Charli’s stomach flipped. His mind, treacherous, offered him a dozen interpretations. He rejected all of them and clung to the only one that matched the world they lived in:

**Consent. Standards. Clean.**

He nodded. “Yes.”

Celeste’s hands were cool and steady. She applied the moisturiser with brisk, professional gentleness—cheeks, forehead, jawline. No lingering. No sweetness. Just care, exact and unembarrassed.

And Charli—Charli felt his whole system do that same downshift it had done when she brushed his hair.

As if his body understood, before his mind could, that this kind of touch didn’t demand anything back.

Celeste finished and stepped away.

“There,” she said, evaluating like a technician. “Better.”

Charli blinked at his own reflection. He looked… the same.

And yet he didn’t.

He looked like someone who had been handled as if he mattered.

Celeste rinsed her hands and dried them. Then, without looking away, she said quietly:

“I’m glad you asked me that.”

Charli’s throat tightened. “Mum told me it was practical.”

Celeste’s gaze didn’t waver.

“It is,” she said. And then, because she was Celeste—because she didn’t do vague—she added, softer: “And it also tells me you heard me.”

Charli swallowed.

“I’m trying,” he admitted.

Celeste nodded once, the same decisive nod she gave to finished work.

“I can see that,” she said. “Keep going.”

Then she turned off the light, brushed past him in the doorway with casual, unromantic proximity, and headed back down the hallway.

“Come on,” she called over her shoulder. “We’re not having a serious moment at midnight. Tea, then bed.”

Charli followed, heart thumping, and for once he didn’t feel like he needed to earn the right to be there.

He just needed to… maintain.

And, unbelievably, he could do that.

---

If you want to dial the “offer him a facial” up or down, here are two clean variants you can swap in:

* **Less intimate:** Celeste *doesn’t touch him*; she just shows him the products and talks him through it like a checklist.
* **Slightly more intimate (still clean):** she asks “May I?” as above, but keeps it brisk, functional, almost clinical — which makes the emotional undercurrent stronger, not weaker.

If you tell me which way you want it to lean, I can tighten the scene accordingly.
