# Scene 15

Option 2 it is — and yes, that makes *perfect* sense.

If Mara is the atelier’s **steel** (standards, structure, consequence), then Lauren can be the **felt lining**: still tough, still competent, but warmer in delivery. That contrast will stop the whole women’s competence network from collapsing into “one voice.” It also makes Mara’s dryness *more powerful*, because it’s a choice, not the default ambience of the world.

Sarah then becomes useful as a third flavour: sharp, brisk, slightly combative — not warm, but not “Mara-clone” either.

Below is your Scene 15 (the cleaned version I gave), now with **Option 2 stitched on** as a final button.

## Scene 15 — “Ladders” (Celeste POV)

By the third day, Charlie stopped looking like a guest.

He moved through the atelier as if the place had finally given him rails: cut, stitch, test, record — repeat. The rhythm took the tremor out of him, not because the work became easy, but because it became *legible*. He could be useful without having to invent a personality around it.

Mara didn’t praise him. She rewarded him with continuity.

The three blocks lived on the wall now — traced paper over brown card, corners clipped, waistlines marked with blunt authority. Each had its own small forest of notes in Mara’s hand: *MOVE TIE POINT 12mm*, *ADD SECONDARY ANCHOR*, *WATCH TOP EDGE TORQUE*, *UNDERARM GUARD?* The templates were beginning to look less like experiments and more like tools.

On the corkboard beside them, I’d pinned my research the way Mara liked things pinned: not like inspiration, like evidence.

**WORKING STAYS: WHAT THEY COMPROMISE**, I’d written at the top.

Under it, three museum-clean photos of garments that weren’t. Underarm guards that looked like someone had finally admitted armpits exist. Straps that told the truth about lifting. Edges reinforced the way you reinforce anything you intend to keep using.

Mara had read the board once, silently. Then she’d taken a pencil and added her own captions, more brutal than mine:

**ABRASION IS REAL.**
**LIFT IS REAL.**
**WEAR IS REAL.**

Charlie had stared at those words for a long time, as if they were permission.

Now he was at the fitting mat again — not hidden, not staged — standing where the floor tape made the world measurable while Mara tightened the lacing with the quiet patience of someone tensioning a rig. He wore the mock-up over his T-shirt: Mara insisted the first truth should never be theatrical.

“Arms up.”

He lifted.

The top edge behaved. Not perfectly, but honestly. It shifted and then settled, like a tool that had learned where it belonged.

“Reach forward.”

He reached.

The diagonal crease appeared, but softer now, less accusing. The load had been persuaded into a better route. Charlie’s jaw loosened a fraction. He didn’t smile — he never smiled during tests — but he looked less like he was waiting to be caught out.

Mara stopped and stepped back.

“Ledger.”

Charlie went to the table and wrote. I watched his hand, the way it no longer apologised on paper. When he wrote, he wasn’t a boy in a room. He was a technician.

The door opened while he was still writing. Not a dramatic entrance. Not an interruption weighted with significance. Just the sound of someone arriving in daylight.

Lauren.

She didn’t come in with a mother’s alarm or a mother’s scanning. She came with a tote bag slung over her shoulder, keys in her hand, and the calm face of someone who had learned which problems were solved by volume and which were solved by structure. She took in the room in one glance — the templates, the ledger, the corkboard with my pinned references — and her eyes narrowed, not with suspicion, but with appraisal.

“Mara,” she said.

“Lauren,” Mara replied, as if she’d been expecting her at this minute.

Lauren set the tote on the table and unzipped it. Out came a roll of twill tape, a packet of grommets, and a small envelope that looked like nothing until you remembered how much of Wardrobe’s authority lived in small parts.

“I brought the hardware,” Lauren said. Then, without softening her voice: “And I assume this is the part where you tell me what you need from me.”

Mara’s gaze held hers.

“It is.”

Charlie had gone very still. Not because Lauren frightened him — Lauren didn’t do intimidation. Because she represented the outside world walking into Wardrobe without asking permission.

Mara didn’t let that become drama.

“We’re building a block,” she said. “Returning-to-work. Real labour. Real distribution. Different tolerances.”

Lauren nodded once, as if Mara had simply named something she’d carried for years.

“You want a baseline,” she said.

“Yes.”

Lauren glanced at Charlie, and the glance was both maternal and professional — *I see you*, and also: *I will behave properly.*

She turned to Mara. “Please tell me your conditions.”

Mara answered like policy, not like reassurance.

“Scheduled. Factual. No commentary. No unscheduled access. If you’re in the room, you’re in the work.”

Lauren’s face didn’t change, but something in her shoulders loosened — the relief of hearing competence speak in complete sentences.

“Fine,” she said. “I’m not here to watch. I’m here to build something that doesn’t punish women.”

That was the first time Charlie looked up properly. He looked at Lauren as if he’d never heard anyone say that out loud.

Mara lifted her chin toward the ledger.

“Charlie,” she said. “New page. Same headings. Add body type.”

Charlie’s pen hovered. His throat moved. He looked at Mara like he was asking permission to direct a grown woman.

Mara didn’t even glance at him. “It’s allowed.”

Charlie swallowed. Then he looked at Lauren.

“Movement,” he said. “If you’re willing. Same list.”

Lauren nodded once. “Of course.”

Charlie wrote:

**ATTEMPT 2 — BODY TYPE: RETURNING-TO-WORK (BASELINE)**

He didn’t decorate it. He didn’t apologise for it. He just wrote it as fact.

That was when Sarah arrived.

She came in with the particular energy of someone who never asks whether she’s welcome. Her accent carried the UK cleanly — sharp edges, no apology. She took one look at Lauren at the table, then at Charlie, then at Mara, and her mouth made a shape that wasn’t quite a smile.

“Oh,” she said. “We’re doing this today, are we?”

Mara didn’t look up. “We’re doing work every day.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to the policy line at the top of the open ledger page.

“Still with the rules,” she said, casual as a pin. “All this managing.”

Charlie’s shoulders rose, and I saw the old reflex trying to return — the instinct to get smaller before anyone could make him. Mara’s voice cut across it.

“Don’t.”

Charlie froze.

Sarah lifted a brow. “I’m not being unkind. I’m being realistic. If he wants to work in a women’s world, he can face women’s challenges. Front-facing. No special cover.”

Lauren’s gaze landed on Sarah with a calm so controlled it was almost polite.

“And who made you spokesperson for ‘women’s challenges’?” Lauren asked.

Sarah snorted. “Oh, come off it. Women manage. Women cope. We don’t need—”

Mara set the reed boning down with a soft, decisive click.

“You’re confusing coping with virtue,” Mara said dryly.

Sarah opened her mouth. But Mara wasn’t done.

“And you’re confusing governance with weakness.”

Sarah’s expression sharpened. “Governance.”

Mara nodded toward the ledger and then — with a small tilt of her head — toward my corkboard.

“See that board?” she said. “That’s not comfort. That’s evidence.”

Sarah glanced, and her mouth tightened as she took in the blunt pragmatism of garments built for bodies that moved.

“Underarm guards,” Mara said. “Because abrasion exists. Straps because people lift. Reinforced edges because things wear out. Women solved problems by making rules and building tools. They didn’t ‘cope’ for sport.”

Sarah’s jaw worked. Her eyes flicked back to Charlie — properly this time, as a worker in the room, not a test case for her opinions. Her lips tightened.

“So what,” she said, voice flatter, “we wrap him in cotton wool forever?”

“No,” Mara said. “We train competence like we train anything else: by repetition and standards.”

Sarah’s chin lifted. “That’s what I’m saying. He can’t crumble the first time someone looks at him funny.”

Mara’s gaze held hers for a long beat, and then she nodded once — grudgingly, because it was fair.

“Fine,” Mara said. “But we don’t train resilience by ambush.”

The room went very still — not tense, just attentive.

Mara turned to Charlie.

“Come here.”

He startled — that instinctive fear of being summoned for judgement — and then he obeyed. He stepped to the table. Lauren stayed where she was, not hovering, but present in the way a seatbelt is present: you don’t notice it until you need it, and then you’re grateful it was always there.

Mara put her hand on the ledger.

“You understand this truth,” she said. “The garment fails. You write it. We fix it.”

Charlie nodded. Mara’s voice didn’t soften. It simply shifted into reality.

“Here’s the other truth. The work leaves the room. People notice. Some will be normal. Some won’t.”

Charlie’s fingers tightened around his pen.

Lauren didn’t rush to comfort. She simply stayed quiet, and that quiet said: *You can stand in this.*

Mara went on. “You don’t choose what other people are. You choose what you do when they are that way.”

Charlie swallowed. “What… do I do?”

Mara looked at him as if the question was the beginning of adulthood.

“You keep working,” she said. “You keep your facts straight. You don’t perform. You don’t bargain. And you never disappear.”

Sarah let out a short breath. “That last one’s going to be hard for him.”

Charlie blinked. Sarah shrugged, unapologetic. “I’m not being nasty. I’m being useful.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched — the smallest sign of amusement — and then she looked at Charlie.

“You don’t have to be fearless,” Lauren said. “You just have to stay in the room.”

Charlie stared at the ledger, at his own handwriting. It was evidence too: that he’d done something awkward, repeatedly, and survived the feeling of it.

“I can do that,” he said quietly.

Mara nodded once. “Good.”

She tapped the movement list pinned near the fitting mat.

“We do it in rungs,” she said. “A ladder.”

Charlie frowned. “A ladder.”

Mara’s eyes were steady. “First rung: you can be seen working. Second: you can be spoken to while working without losing your hands. Third: you can answer a stupid comment without trying to become a different person.”

Sarah exhaled. “Fourth rung: you tell them to get stuffed.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to her.

Sarah lifted a shoulder. “Politely, if you must.”

Mara didn’t smile, but something in her face loosened — the slightest concession that Sarah had landed in the right register at last.

Then Mara reached for the mock-up again.

“All right,” she said. “Back to the proof.”

They didn’t make it an event.

Mara laced. Lauren stood where she was told. Charlie watched the lines in the cloth as if they were a map he could learn to read in any weather.

And I watched the watching.

Lauren watched the garment, not the boy. Sarah watched the room, and I watched Sarah watching — the moment her disdain failed to find a foothold because there was no weakness being performed for her to kick.

Mara didn’t look up.

“First rung,” she said.

And Charlie lifted his arms.

### On Lauren’s warmth (quick craft note, because you asked)

Yes: keeping Lauren a touch more conversational is a smart way to differentiate her from Mara *without* making her “soft.” Warmth can be **competence delivered with human cadence** — she can say “please,” she can ask rather than command, she can phrase things in a way that *includes* rather than *orders*, and she can still be utterly consequential.

If you want, in Scene 16 we can lean into this contrast even more: Mara will set the next rung clinically; Lauren will give Charlie a tiny, warm, practical line that helps him actually *do* it.
