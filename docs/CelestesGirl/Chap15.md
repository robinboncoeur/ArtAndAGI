# Glom

It can be an instant hit **without** feeling too fast—if you frame it correctly.

What would feel “meteoric” (and contrived) is: everyone adores her universally, immediately, with no trade-offs.

What will feel *true* (and deliciously sharp) is:

* **Donors “glom” onto her quickly** because she solves problems in real time and makes them feel clever/important…
* …but **management’s affection is conditional**, because powerful women are only liked when they’re useful and controllable.
* And **Celeste’s costs escalate immediately**: visibility, expectations, fatigue, being “on” constantly, her autonomy getting quietly eaten.

So yes: donors can take to her *fast*, because donor culture rewards exactly what she has—composure, polish, dry wit, boundary-setting that reads as “class,” and the ability to neutralise awkwardness without making anyone feel accused.

### Why it’s believable donors like her quickly

Donors love:

* **competence they can witness** (fixing a moment, smoothing a scene)
* **witty authority** (a woman who can cut through nonsense elegantly)
* **exclusivity** (being “handled” by the Lady feels special)
* **narrative** (they want to tell others they met “someone remarkable”)

Celeste is a perfect donor-story.

### The realism lever: make it *fast attachment*, not *fast trust*

They’ll like her quickly, but:

* they’ll still test her,
* they’ll still try to cross boundaries,
* and some will do the “compliment trap” thing: praise that’s actually a leash.

### And crucially: a few people *won’t* like her

You only need a couple:

* a committee wife who dislikes Celeste’s sharpness
* a male donor who can’t stand a young woman who won’t laugh politely
* management people who fear she’ll become indispensable and therefore unmanageable

That prevents “meteoric” from feeling like wish fulfilment.

## Charl being unnoticed: also very believable

This is one of the most chilling, female-readable truths you can give the story:

**A plain maid is invisible until she’s inconvenient.**

So yes:

* most donors won’t notice him,
* some will treat him like furniture,
* and the ones who *do* notice will notice only as an opportunity for entitlement (“girl, fetch”).

That invisibility is both protection and harm, which is exactly your theme.

## A good way to pace it

If you want the “instant hit” feel without it being too easy, do it like this:

### Scene A: The first donor cluster

She handles three micro-crises in ten minutes (a complaint, a scheduling hiccup, a rude comment). They’re impressed. They “discover” her.

### Scene B: The cost shows immediately

She’s swarmed. She can’t eat. She can’t breathe. She’s “on” for hours. She realises: *this role is designed to extract.*

### Scene C: Management tries to capitalise

They want her at every event. They start making her availability “belong” to them.

### Scene D: Charl’s first true calibration grief moment

A donor woman snaps fingers for “the maid” without even looking at his face. Charl complies because that’s the rule—but inside he’s cold.

Celeste sees it, and it hits her as a responsibility: not romantic, not tender—**ethical.**

---

If you’d like, I’ll write the next scene as: **Celeste’s first donor-facing hour**—the “glom” happens quickly, but we see the hooks in it, and we see Charl’s invisibility working exactly the way women know it works.

## Celeste — The First Hour

They gave me the manor like it was a gift.

It wasn’t.

It was a stage with better lighting.

The first thing that changed wasn’t my clothing or my title. It was the angle of people’s attention. In Wardrobe, people looked at me when something broke. Here, people looked at me because they wanted to be seen looking at me—because proximity to “Lady of the Manor” made them feel like they belonged.

I stood at the bottom of the staircase in a gown that was more expensive than it had any right to be, hair smoothed into obedience, posture weaponised into elegance. The room smelled of polished wood and citrus and money.

Charl stood two steps behind and to my left, hands folded at his apron, eyes level and quiet. If you didn’t know him, you wouldn’t. Not properly.

That was the point.

I hadn’t been on duty ten minutes before the first donor found me.

Mrs. Langford—pearls, perfume, smile like a paper cut. She approached with her husband orbiting behind her, slightly lost, as men often are when they’re not the main character of a room.

“Celeste,” she said, as if we were old friends. “There you are.”

I gave her my polished face. “Mrs. Langford. Welcome back.”

“Oh, call me Imogen,” she trilled, the way women do when they’re testing whether you’ll accept a false intimacy. “We simply adore what you’ve done. Everything feels… elevated.”

I resisted the urge to ask what *everything* meant. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”

Her husband stepped forward, offering his hand with the confidence of someone who assumed my job was to affirm him. “Beautiful work, Miss Shelley. A proper touch of class.”

I shook his hand, brief and controlled. “Thank you.”

He leaned closer as if sharing a secret. “Much better than all that back-room sewing.”

There it was: the contempt wrapped in compliment.

I smiled politely. “It all matters. People just notice different parts.”

Imogen laughed, delighted. “Oh, I like you.”

Of course she did. I didn’t make her work.

She pointed toward a wall display where a set of framed “historical notes” hung for patrons to read. “However—these are wrong.”

I glanced. The dates were slightly off. Not disastrous, but wrong.

“We can correct them,” I said.

“It’s important,” Imogen continued, leaning in as if she were offering me moral guidance. “Accuracy matters. We’re donors because we care.”

Her husband nodded solemnly, as if he’d ever once cared about accuracy in his life.

I kept my expression calm. “You’re right. Charl—”

Charl stepped forward immediately, silent and efficient.

Imogen’s eyes slid past him like he was a curtain.

“—make a note,” I finished. “Have the dates amended before next weekend.”

Charl nodded once. “Yes, Miss Shelley.”

He didn’t look at Imogen. He didn’t look at the husband. He looked at the display like it was a seam to be fixed.

Imogen didn’t thank him. She didn’t even register that he’d spoken.

She turned back to me, satisfied. “Perfect.”

They moved on, leaving me exactly as they’d found me: useful, polished, unruffled.

Charl retreated back to my left shoulder, quiet.

I watched him with the edge of my attention—the way a woman watches the perimeter while still appearing to be present.

His face was controlled.

But his eyes were a fraction too alert.

The next donor arrived before the air could settle.

A man this time—Mr. Sutherland, committee member. He approached with a grin that wanted to be charming and failed.

“Ah,” he said, as if greeting a new acquisition. “So you’re the famous Celeste.”

“I’m not famous,” I replied.

He laughed anyway. “Oh, you will be.”

His gaze flicked past me—over my shoulder—landing on Charl for the first time.

Not on Charl’s face.

On Charl’s body, briefly, the way men check whether a woman fits into their category of respect or entitlement.

He smiled wider. “And who’s this, then?”

Charl’s posture tightened by a millimetre.

I answered before the question could become a hook.

“My attendant,” I said. “Wardrobe support.”

Mr. Sutherland nodded, satisfied, then—inevitably—leaned in slightly toward Charl as if he were addressing a household pet.

“Sweetheart,” he said lightly, “fetch us a programme, would you?”

The word *sweetheart* landed in the room like grease.

Charl’s chin dipped. His hands moved automatically, ready to obey.

I didn’t allow it.

I turned my gaze to Mr. Sutherland, expression still polite.

“No,” I said.

He blinked. “No?”

“No,” I repeated, still calm. “You can fetch your own programme. Charl isn’t here for your errands.”

His smile faltered. “I was just—”

“I know what you were,” I said, and kept my tone soft enough that I wasn’t “making a scene.” The trick is always to remove the oxygen without raising your voice.

Mr. Sutherland cleared his throat. He tried to recover with humour.

“Well, aren’t we firm.”

“Yes,” I agreed.

A beat.

Then I offered him an exit that preserved his ego, because rich men need ramps.

“If you need something,” I continued smoothly, “ask the front desk. They’ll help.”

Mr. Sutherland’s laugh came out thin. “Right. Of course. Apologies.”

I smiled, gracious. “No harm done.”

He walked away.

Charl stayed still, eyes fixed somewhere slightly above the floor.

When the room had swallowed Mr. Sutherland again, I spoke without turning my head.

“Did you hear what he called you?” I asked quietly.

Charl’s voice came out level. “Yes.”

“And what did you feel?” I asked.

He hesitated—just long enough to reveal effort.

“Anger,” he said, softly. “And… embarrassment.”

“Good,” I said. “Don’t show either.”

Charl’s breath shuddered once, quickly smothered.

I watched his hands. They remained folded, controlled.

He didn’t apologise. He didn’t thank me. He didn’t make it about his hurt.

He just stood there, bearing it.

That was the horror, beginning to take shape.

Not costume. Not optics.

Endurance.

The next donor cluster came like weather—three women together, all wearing that practiced brightness that says: *we are civilised because we can afford to be.*

They glommed immediately, not because I was dazzling, but because I was *useful* in the way wealthy people love: I made their day feel curated.

“Oh my goodness, you’re Celeste.”

“You’re so young.”

“You’re so composed.”

“Where did you train?”

“You have such a way with people.”

Compliments, but each one a small attempt to locate me in their hierarchy.

I smiled. I answered. I redirected. I gave them nothing personal and everything they wanted: the sense that the manor was in competent hands.

One of them—Mrs. Hargreaves—leaned in as if sharing gossip.

“Is it true you were running Wardrobe?” she asked, voice lowered.

“It’s true,” I replied.

“How very… practical,” she said, with that faint disdain some women reserve for other women who’ve had to work.

I smiled gently. “Practical keeps the fantasy intact.”

She blinked, then laughed as if I’d made a joke. “Oh, I like you.”

Of course she did.

They drifted on, leaving behind their perfume and their invisible expectations.

And still—almost no one looked at Charl.

They spoke in front of him like he wasn’t there.

They stepped around him like he was part of the furniture.

They did not notice his intelligence, his restraint, his grief.

And then, exactly as Talia had predicted, it happened:

A donor wife reached back without looking and pressed a glass into Charl’s hands.

“Hold this,” she said, already turning away.

Charl froze.

His hands tightened around the glass with reflexive care—because he was meticulous, because he didn’t want a spill, because he didn’t want to become a joke.

He looked at me, eyes flicking up once—asking permission without asking.

I could have taken it from him. I could have corrected the woman. I could have made it a boundary.

But there are moments where the most instructive thing you can do is *let the truth land.*

So I did not move.

I let Charl hold the glass.

He stood there, invisible and burdened, not daring to shift his weight in case he drew attention.

And I watched the realisation bloom in him like a bruise:

Women carry things they didn’t agree to carry, because the cost of refusal is always higher than the cost of compliance.

After the cluster moved away, I stepped closer and took the glass from his hands.

“Don’t,” I said quietly, when he began to apologise with his eyes.

He swallowed.

“I didn’t know what to—” he whispered.

“You did fine,” I replied. “You kept it boring.”

Charl’s mouth tightened. “Is this what it’s like?”

“Yes,” I said.

His eyes widened slightly. He looked almost ill.

“It’s constant,” he murmured.

“Yes,” I repeated.

A pause.

Then Charl said something that wasn’t about him at all—which was how I knew his personality was consolidating into something more than compliance.

“How do you… not hate everyone?” he asked softly.

I almost laughed—not because it was funny, but because it was the most honest question in the room.

I kept my voice even.

“You pick your battles,” I said. “And you pick your people.”

Charl looked at me, and I saw it then: the grief wasn’t only about how he was being treated.

It was about the realisation that women had been doing this forever, and he’d never noticed.

I let him feel it.

Then I gave him structure, because structure is the only mercy in a system like this.

“Stay two steps behind,” I instructed. “Eyes level. Hands still. If someone gives you something, you hand it to me the first moment it’s socially safe. If someone asks you to do something outside your role, you look at me.”

Charl nodded once.

“And speak softly,” I added. “Not because you’re small. Because softness makes you vanish.”

Charl’s jaw tightened at that.

“Yes,” he said.

We moved again, back into the room, into the light, into the thick donor air.

The glom continued.

They loved me quickly—because I was a satisfying object: young authority, polished sharpness, a novelty with manners.

But I could already feel the hook beneath it.

The expectation that I would be available.

That I would be “on.”

That I would belong to the manor, the donors, the optics, the story they wanted to tell about themselves.

And behind me, two steps back, Charl walked like quiet labour.

Unnoticed.

A blessing.

And a bruise.
