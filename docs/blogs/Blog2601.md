I've been a member for a month. My gallery is a mix of different ideas: period scenes and feminisation scenarios and even music. I have 126 'deviations' (images and the 'Celeste's Girl' story), 4838 profile views and 522 watchers. The watchers number will drop as all the kink stuff is removed (putting it into "st.ash" for now).

The 'Celeste's Girl' story advances apace. Emily is keeping on the straight-and-narrow, not allowing anything even slightly fetish-related on a page. My 'bio' describes the *why*:

---

* Yes, it's a story about a job in Wardrobe, but it's more about being in a public space as a woman and the quiet maths women do to stay safe.
* Celeste's Girl is about agency, dignity, lived experience.

*Important Note: Artwork  changes. Nothing is permanent. Creations will change, be replaced by a better version or even disappear altogether. I’m revising older deviations to match the direction of my work now: agency, dignity, and real-world empathy. I am phasing out ‘old-tone’ uploads. This will mean that if you favourited an 'old-tone' image, the replacement image and description will almost certainly send a different message to the original. My "old-tone" images were for fun and a bit of self-deprecating satire, but I have discovered they have landed quite differently than intended. If the 'old-tone' images are what you are here for, it’s probably best to unfollow. No hard feelings.*

**All my so-called artwork, including any descriptive text, depicts adults: no images involve minors. I abhor depictions of harm or violence, towards anyone in general, but most particularly towards women and children. None of the images reflect actual events: all depictions are imaginary.**

As CelestesGrl, I reserve exclusive ownership of the non-derivative art that I post on Deviant Art, visual, auditory and text (literature). Downloading is permitted for your personal enjoyment. Feel free to create derivations of my non-derivative art if so inspired. 

Permissions for creating derivations (please read):  
- You may create new, transformative derivatives inspired by my own work (remixes, reinterpretations, new compositions).
- Please do NOT reupload near-identical copies (including “same image with denoise/filters/upscale”), as that’s not transformative.
- Credit is gently requested for derivatives: “Inspired by CelestesGrl” and link back for images that are original with me. Please credit the originator of the image (which I post links to) when the image is a derivative.

And that's the name of that tune. Whilst I do get notifications that people are starting to "Watch" my site, I anticipate the numbers will still drop as I remove more and more of the "old-tone" stuff. Which is fine by me.

The "Celeste's Girl" story made some huge progress today. For a blow-by-blow, have a look at [Notes2026-01-02](../blogs/Notes2026-01-02.md).
