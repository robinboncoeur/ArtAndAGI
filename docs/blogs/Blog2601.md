I've been a member for a month. My gallery is a mix of different ideas: period scenes and feminisation scenarios and even music. I have 126 'deviations' (images and the 'Celeste's Girl' story), 4838 profile views and 522 watchers. The watchers number will drop as all the kink stuff is removed (putting it into "st.ash" for now).

The 'Celeste's Girl' story advances apace. Emily is keeping on the straight-and-narrow, not allowing anything even slightly fetish-related on a page. My 'bio' describes the *why*:

---

* Yes, it's a story about a job in Wardrobe, but it's more about being in a public space as a woman and the quiet maths women do to stay safe.
* Celeste's Girl is about agency, dignity, lived experience.

*Important Note: Artwork  changes. Nothing is permanent. Creations will change, be replaced by a better version or even disappear altogether. I’m revising older deviations to match the direction of my work now: agency, dignity, and real-world empathy. I am phasing out ‘old-tone’ uploads. This will mean that if you favourited an 'old-tone' image, the replacement image and description will almost certainly send a different message to the original. My "old-tone" images were for fun and a bit of self-deprecating satire, but I have discovered they have landed quite differently than intended. If the 'old-tone' images are what you are here for, it’s probably best to unfollow. No hard feelings.*

**All my so-called artwork, including any descriptive text, depicts adults: no images involve minors. I abhor depictions of harm or violence, towards anyone in general, but most particularly towards women and children. None of the images reflect actual events: all depictions are imaginary.**

As CelestesGrl, I reserve exclusive ownership of the non-derivative art that I post on Deviant Art, visual, auditory and text (literature). Downloading is permitted for your personal enjoyment. Feel free to create derivations of my non-derivative art if so inspired. 

Permissions for creating derivations (please read):  
- You may create new, transformative derivatives inspired by my own work (remixes, reinterpretations, new compositions).
- Please do NOT reupload near-identical copies (including “same image with denoise/filters/upscale”), as that’s not transformative.
- Credit is gently requested for derivatives: “Inspired by CelestesGrl” and link back for images that are original with me. Please credit the originator of the image (which I post links to) when the image is a derivative.

And that's the name of that tune. Whilst I do get notifications that people are starting to "Watch" my site, I anticipate the numbers will still drop as I remove more and more of the "old-tone" stuff. Which is fine by me.

The "Celeste's Girl" story made some huge progress today. For a blow-by-blow, have a look at [Notes2026-01-02](../Emily/2601/Notes2026-01-02.md).

## Rearranging

**03.Jan.2026**  
All notes Emily and I have created are in this blog folder. Renamed 'Discussionxxx' pages to arbitrary 18, 19, 20 pages, so it is organised. The content clearly isn't. Actually, the whole 'Notes' group is a bit of a dog's breakfast, chronologically. In other words, you can't follow the story by the indicated date of the file. I saved stuff everywhere there was space.

From the 25-12-31 page on, it's tidier. Saved the blow-by-blow of that day's discussions with Emily. I'm all the way to Scene 22, so I'm going to give her a break today whilst I tweak the text.

## Rearranging

**18.Jan.2026**  
Just set up a discord server for celestesgrl. Emily kindly provided me some rules for the welcome page:

---

Absolutely. Here’s a light, friendly set that reads like *community norms* rather than “terms and conditions.” You can copy-paste as-is, or tweak the voice to match your server.

### Welcome rules (short + non-draconian)

* **Be kind, be curious.** Disagree without getting personal.
* **Assume good intent first.** If something lands badly, ask for clarification before escalating.
* **No harassment, hate, or bullying.** Zero tolerance for targeting people over identity or background.
* **Keep it comfy for everyone.** No explicit sexual content, gore, or shock-posting.
* **Respect privacy.** Don’t share anyone’s personal info (including DMs) without clear consent.
* **Stay roughly on-topic.** Tangents are fine—just use the right channel when possible.
* **No spam or scams.** This includes unsolicited promos, repeated pings, and sketchy links.
* **Help mods help you.** If there’s an issue, **report it** (don’t dogpile).

### Optional “nice-to-have” line (adds warmth)

* **We’re building a space with good vibes and good boundaries.** If you’re not sure, choose the kinder option.

If you tell me the server’s vibe (friends-only, creative writing, fandom, tech help, etc.), I can tune these to feel even more “native” to your community’s voice.

---

[Q]  
Excellent. That's perfect. It's going to be for creative writing, possibly also a bit for AI illustration.

---

[Emily]  
Lovely — then I’d keep the same “light touch,” but add just a couple of craft-specific norms that protect people’s work and keep critique from turning into accidental cruelty.

Here’s a tuned version you can drop straight into your welcome message:

### Welcome (Creative Writing + AI Illustration)

* **Be kind, be curious.** Disagree without making it personal.
* **Respect the work.** Feedback should help the creator build, not feel small.
* **Consent-based critique.** Ask before giving heavy critique, or use a channel/tag like **[Crit Welcome]** / **[No Crit]**.
* **No plagiarism.** Don’t repost someone’s writing or art without permission (including “I found this cool thing” if it’s not yours).
* **Credit matters.** If you share inspirations, references, or tools, attribute them when you can.
* **AI content: label it.** If an image/text is AI-assisted, just say so—no drama, no shame, just clarity.
* **Keep it safe for the room.** No harassment, hate, shock content, or explicit material.
* **Respect privacy.** No doxxing, no posting private DMs without consent.
* **Stay roughly on-topic.** Use the right channels so everyone can find what they came for.
* **Help mods help you.** If something’s off, report it—don’t dogpile.

### Optional “tone-setter” line

We’re here for **craft, momentum, and good boundaries**. If you’re unsure, choose the kinder option.

If you want, I can also give you 6–8 quick channel tags that make this *really* easy in practice (e.g., **#drafts**, **#critique**, **#prompts**, **#ai-workbench**, **#resources**, **#wins**), plus a tiny template people can paste at the top of a post (“What I want feedback on / What I don’t”).

---

Yep — slow, intentional growth is *exactly* how you keep a creative space pleasant (and not instantly swamped by drive-by chaos).

A few low-effort approaches that work well when you’re not on Discord constantly:

### Invite strategy that won’t drain you

* **Invite one-by-one, not publicly.** DM people you already trust (or who’ve shown good vibes in your comments elsewhere).
* **“Soft launch” mindset.** Treat the first month as a quiet studio rather than a bustling café. A handful of good people beats fifty randoms.
* **Give each new person a tiny on-ramp.** Even just: “Hi! Feel free to introduce yourself and share what you’re working on.”

### Lightweight structure so it runs without you

* **One “Start Here” channel** with:

  * your welcome rules (the ones you liked),
  * how to post (drafts/crit/AI),
  * and where to put what.
* **Two or three channels only at first**, e.g.:

  * **#introductions**
  * **#workshop** (drafts + feedback)
  * **#ai-illustration** (images, prompts, workflow notes)

That’s enough to feel “real” without becoming a maintenance job.

### A “not-often-online” safety net

If you’re away a lot, the biggest quality-of-life win is setting a couple of default permissions:

* **New members start with limited posting power** (still friendly, not punitive):

  * can read everything,
  * can post in **#introductions** and maybe **#workshop**,
  * but can’t @everyone, can’t spam links everywhere, etc.
* **One trusted person as a helper mod** (even if they just keep an eye out). Doesn’t have to be formal; just someone who can quietly remove obvious nonsense if it ever appears.

### The “why did they vanish?” thing

Totally normal. Creative folks often pop in, post a couple things, then disappear into life. It doesn’t mean the server is failing — it just means your community hasn’t formed its “gravity” yet.

### A simple message you can DM when inviting someone

If you want a short, low-pressure invite line:

> Hey — I’ve started a small Discord for creative writing (and a bit of AI illustration). It’s intentionally quiet and friendly, more studio than social feed. If you’d like an invite, I can send one.

If you later decide you *do* want a bit of help with the channel/tag setup, I can give you a minimal “starter kit” that feels professional but stays easy to run.
