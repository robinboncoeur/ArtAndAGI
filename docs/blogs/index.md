I wish I had started this back in '22 or '23, when I fist started using AI and models to make images. MidJourney was the beginning, but I could see the subscription was quickly going to add up. Plus, well, it was limiting.

Went to Leonardo AI but it was much of a muchness. Cheaper, a free tier, but limiting.

My first serious graphics card -- 28.Jun.2023 -- was a MSI GeForce RTX 3070 Ventus 2X OC 8G. AUD $669.00! Six months later, I realised 8 gig VRAM wasn't going to cut it. So, it was the Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4060 Ti Windforce OC 16G graphics card this time, at AUD $749. Make it make sense. Twice the VRAM for less than $100 more. The 8 gig card is in a PC behind me. Haven't booted it in a while.

Sure — and I’ll be careful to separate three things that often get mashed together online:

1. **a fetish (a specific erotic focus)**
2. **kink communities (consensual practices, relationships, culture)**
3. **fetish *content ecosystems* (how platforms + attention loops behave)**

People often say “fetish” when what they really mean is #3.

## What a “fetish” actually is

In plain terms, a fetish is an erotic focus that’s narrower and more specific than “I find people attractive.” It might be a garment, a dynamic, a scenario, a power arrangement, a body feature, a transformation theme — anything that becomes the *primary* trigger.

That doesn’t automatically make it bad. It’s just a pattern of arousal.

## Why it can feel “cheap” or “low-value”

When it feels cheap, it’s usually not because erotic interest exists. It’s because the *attention* behaves in ways that flatten people and stories.

### 1) Reduction: the person becomes a mechanism

A fetish lens tends to compress a character into a few “functional” attributes:

* “does this satisfy my trigger?”
* “does it escalate?”
* “does it deliver the payoff?”

That makes the human being in the image feel like a vending machine, not a subject with agency.

### 2) Escalation pressure: it’s never allowed to stay subtle

Once an audience is trained to expect a specific hit, subtlety reads as “not enough.”
So the creator gets pushed toward:

* more explicitness
* more humiliation
* more coercion
* tighter framing on “the point”
* faster payoff

Even if you personally don’t want to go there, the incentive structure nudges you.

### 3) Context collapse: the same image means different things to different viewers

A dress in a story about work, history, and self-possession reads one way to you — and a completely different way to someone browsing for a trigger.

When you feel “cheap,” it’s often the dissonance of realizing your work is being *used* in a way that ignores what you put into it.

### 4) Entitlement behavior

You’ve seen this directly: when you change direction, a subset reacts like you “broke their stash.”
That’s a hallmark of an audience relating to your work as inventory rather than art:

* warmth when you comply
* contempt when you don’t

That dynamic feels gross because it’s not appreciation — it’s consumption with demands.

### 5) It can smuggle in misogyny and power scripts

A lot of popular fetish tropes (not all, but many) are downstream of entitlement:

* coercion framed as “fun”
* humiliation framed as “deserved”
* women as props, gatekeepers, punishers, trophies, rewards
* “consent” treated as optional scenery

Even if the surface looks playful, the underlying script can be: *someone’s autonomy doesn’t matter* — and that’s why it feels low-value.

## The important nuance: consensual kink isn’t inherently low-value

Where kink is mutual, negotiated, and respected, it can be:

* intimate
* creative
* healing
* deeply human

So the issue usually isn’t “sexuality is bad.” It’s whether the *work* treats people as full humans with agency, and whether the *audience* engages as appreciative humans rather than extractive consumers.

## A quick way to tell what you’re dealing with

Ask: **If you removed sexual payoff entirely, would the piece still have a point?**

* If yes → it’s story / character / theme first. Eroticism may be present, but it isn’t the engine.
* If no → it’s primarily stimulus design.

Neither is a moral sin, but they lead to very different audiences and very different aftertastes for the creator.

## Why your pivot feels better

Because you’ve shifted from “trigger delivery” to “meaning delivery”:

* competence, safety, dignity
* agency and consent
* social reality (“how it lands in public”)
* women’s calibration work, women supporting women
* the cost of being seen

That’s inherently higher-resolution. It asks more of the viewer than reflex.

If you want, tell me the shortest version of what you want your gallery to *feel like* (three adjectives is enough), and I’ll map that to: captions, tag strategy, and “red-flag” phrasing that tends to pull the wrong crowd back in.


## Always Works Tags

narrativeart, storytelling, characterstudy, sliceoflife, quietmoments, agency, empathy, consentmatters, livedexperience, socialreality, belonging, newbeginnings, historicalcostume, costumestudy, wardrobe, livinghistory


## Hard Slog? Not Necessarily

It *can* be a slog on DA, yes — but not because you’re doing anything wrong now. It’s because DA behaves like a big river with strong currents:

* Your early posts taught the algorithm (and a chunk of viewers) **what “bin” to put you in**.
* DA’s discovery surfaces you to people whose **favourites look like your early stuff**.
* Those viewers then “watch”, “fave”, comment, and that feedback loop reinforces the same routing.

So the grind isn’t “convincing individuals.” It’s **retraining the routing**.

That said: it’s not a forever problem. It’s a **momentum problem**. Momentum can be redirected, but it’s easiest if you treat it like a strategy, not a moral crusade.

### The hard truth (that’s oddly freeing)

DeviantArt is not primarily a “like-minded community” machine. It’s an **attention + collection** machine. There *are* great, sharp, boundary-aware people there — but the default flow rewards:

* high-signal visual tropes
* familiar “hits”
* repeatable triggers
* fast engagement

Your pivot is basically asking the platform to send you a *different audience*, and it will… but on DA it tends to happen via **new clusters**, not by “converting” the old cluster.

### How to make it not a hard slog

Think in two tracks:

#### Track A: keep the house clean (you’re already doing this)

* Main gallery stays “clean read” (you’ve confirmed not-logged-in view is reassuring).
* Anything ambiguous goes behind Watchers Only, Mature, or is retired.
* Tags and first two lines of description stay consistent: *agency, competence, public space, craft, lived reality*.

This prevents recontamination.

#### Track B: build a second doorway *into a different neighbourhood*

Right now DA knows you for one thing. You need to become known for a second thing that’s adjacent but *not* kink-adjacent. The easiest “second doorway” for you is:

* **costume work / historical dress / living history**
* **narrative illustration**
* **women’s lived experience / social reality micro-vignettes**
* **process posts** (how you build the image, how you revise meaning)

Those topics have their own watcher ecosystems. Once you get *any* traction in those, DA starts cross-pollinating *that* crowd to you.

### Practical moves that shift the watchers faster

You’ll notice these aren’t about arguing with commenters — they’re about signal.

1. **Series branding**
   Give your clean work a consistent label:

* “Wardrobe Notes”
* “Living History Vignettes”
* “Read the Room”
* “Public Space, Private Thoughts”

Series titles are algorithm bait *in the good way*.

2. **Make 1 in 4 posts “pure craft”**
   A post that’s just:

* fabric, seams, silhouettes, fit, layers, period accuracy
* “how to move in a skirt on public transport”
* “why wardrobe is labour”

This attracts history/costume people and bores the dopamine collectors to tears (which is the point).

3. **Comment and fave like a curator**
   DA is reciprocal. If you consistently favourite and comment (briefly, intelligently) on:

* historical costume makers
* women illustrators doing narrative work
* lived-experience art
  …you’ll start getting *their* audience sniffing you out.

4. **Starve the wrong feedback loop**
   If a watcher has a gallery full of kink inventory, don’t engage, don’t visit back, don’t comment. DA rewards mutual interactions; you want to avoid strengthening that graph edge.

### Should you consider other platforms?

If your goal is “like-minded individuals,” you may find it faster elsewhere — not instead of DA, but as an escape valve:

* **Bluesky / Mastodon** (stronger culture of boundary/intent; better for essays + art)
* **Substack** (if you want “thought + image” as a project with a readership)
* **Cara** (artist-forward culture; often less kink-routing than DA)
* Even a **self-hosted hub** (which you already have!) where DA becomes the funnel, not the home.

DA can still be useful as a *distribution pipe*. But you don’t have to treat it as the place your “people” live.

### Is it going to be hard?

It’ll take persistence, but it’s not endless trench warfare if you keep doing what you’re doing:

* clean main gallery
* consistent tags
* consistent first lines
* series identity
* cultivate the right neighbourhoods

You’ve already seen the strongest sign that you’re winning: **“More like this” is now sane.** That’s the algorithm starting to reclassify you.

If you want, tell me what proportion you want long-term:

* 70% *Celeste’s Girl* narrative vignettes
* 20% craft/living history
* 10% personal reflections

…and I’ll suggest a posting cadence + tag/description template that accelerates the audience shift without exhausting you.
