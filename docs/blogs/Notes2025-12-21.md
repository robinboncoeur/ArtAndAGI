[Q]  
Your suggestions for replies made me glad I "counted to 100". This little interchange is also teaching me something about not only people, but online presence, respect (he's convinced I'm female... I have no desire to correct that), and most of all, Emily, this is teaching me a lot about me. Doing the prurient thing at first seemed harmless and fun. Well, it sort-of isn't, really. I've had a look at people's galleries and, more importantly, their 'Favourites'. Highly revelatory... and scary.

---

[Emily]     
Yeah. Once you’ve peeked behind the curtain—people’s *Favourites*, the patterns, the “collections” vibe—you can’t unsee it. It stops feeling like harmless play and starts feeling like you’ve accidentally set up a vending machine… and a certain type of person is furious you’ve swapped the candy for vitamins.

A few things you’re noticing (and you’re not imagining any of it):

### What “Favourites” reveal

They’re less like “I enjoyed this” and more like **a private index of what someone returns to**. When you browse someone’s favourites, you’re basically seeing:

* what they *collect*,
* what they *want on-demand*,
* what mood they’re curating for themselves,
* and (sometimes) what they feel entitled to.

That’s why the pushback is so weirdly personal. If your work was “content” to them, your pivot feels like you “broke their stash.” You didn’t. But that’s how they experience it.

### The respect lesson

You already clocked the key thing: he was interacting like you were a woman—and then, once you stopped providing what he wanted, he switched to **dismissal, mockery, and entitlement**.

That little pivot is *the* patriarchy micro-behaviour in miniature:

* “You’re pleasing, so I’m warm.”
* “You’re not pleasing, so you’re defective / crazy / dishonest.”

It’s not about you being “right” or “wrong.” It’s about compliance.

### The “harmless fun” trap

Prurient content feels harmless because it’s framed as fantasy and consensual consumption. But the ecosystem around it often trains:

* objectification as default,
* coercion as “play,”
* women’s discomfort as a feature, not a bug,
* and entitlement as normal.

You’re not condemning yourself for having been there. You’re noticing the *externalities* now. That’s growth, not hypocrisy.

### Keep It Clean

*How to keep your head (and your project) clean*

A few practical principles you’re already half-doing:

**1) Don’t argue with consumers about your intent.**
They’ll litigate your motives forever. Your best move is what you already did: boundary, block, move on.

**2) Starve the “audience training.”**
Every time you respond at length, you teach them “this is the lever that gets attention.” Silence and consistency retrain the space faster than cleverness.

**3) Keep the “switch” but make it boring.**
Your “swap cheap for real” move is powerful. If you keep doing it, do it without gloating. The more matter-of-fact you are, the less it reads like “gotcha,” and the more it reads like *policy*.

**4) Use layout and gallery architecture to protect casual viewers.**
You’re already doing this: main gallery clean; mature/experiments tucked away. That’s not cowardice—that’s good curation.

### A framing 
*that might help you internally*

You’re not “tricking” people. You’re **ending a transaction you no longer want to run**, and replacing it with a different kind of work. If some people feel “baited,” it’s because they assumed your page existed to serve them.

They’re allowed to leave. You’re allowed to evolve.

If you want, tell me what you saw in a couple of those favourites galleries that spooked you (no links needed)—and I’ll help you translate that into **clear, calm guardrails** for your own page so you can keep creating without feeling like you’re feeding something you despise.

## Read The Room

        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Absolutely — and yes, that two-liner is *perfect* as a “house style” pivot.

Here’s a tag strategy that does two things at once:

1. **Keeps you discoverable to the readers you want** (story, character, period-costume, women’s solidarity, reflective tone)
2. **Starves the “More Like This” engine of the usual bait** (anything that routes you into femdom/sissy/lingerie-caption pipelines)

---

### Default “Clean-Discovery”
*a tag set (copy/paste)*

Use this as your baseline on *most* story-driven images:

**Core / intent**

* `storytelling`
* `narrative`
* `character`
* `characterstudy`
* `women`
* `femaleprotagonist`
* `femaleagency`
* `womensolidarity`
* `girlhood`
* `comingofage`
* `socialcommentary`
* `boundaries`
* `consentculture`
* `selfrespect`
* `empathy`
* `dignity`

**Visual / mood**

* `softlight`
* `cinematic`
* `quietmoment`
* `intimatewithoutsexual`
* `portrait`
* `twoshot`
* `subtext`
* `atmosphere`

**Genre / setting (use what applies)**

* `historicalinspired`
* `periodcostume`
* `costume`
* `wardrobe`
* `faire`
* `travel`
* `trainstation`
* `everydaylife`

**Your project scaffolding**

* `celestesgirl`
* `charlotte`
* `celeste`
* `readtheroom`
* `projectshift`
* `revisioninplace`

**Technique (choose only what’s true)**

* `aiart`
* `aigenerated`
* `comfyui`
* `flux`
* `flux1dev`
* `srpo`
* `qwen`
* `digitalart`

That’s already a lot; if you want a tighter “default 20,” tell me and I’ll compress it.

---

### “Read the Room” Set

This one should skew **social commentary + mentorship**, not romance/sex:

* `readtheroom`
* `women`
* `womensolidarity`
* `femaleagency`
* `boundaries`
* `entitlement`
* `socialcommentary`
* `onlineculture`
* `parasocial`
* `creatorboundaries`
* `characterstudy`
* `narrative`
* `subtext`
* `quietpower`
* `periodcostume`
* `costume`
* `portrait`
* `cinematic`
* `aiart`
* `comfyui`

---

### More Like This” Crowd

What to *avoid* if you want “More Like This” to stop serving you the wrong crowd

Even one or two of these can drag you right back into the same neighborhood:

* Anything kink-coded: `femdom`, `sissy`, `forcedfem`, `humiliation`, `SPH`, `chastity`, `cuck`, etc. (you’ve already purged these — good)
* Lingerie taxonomy tags: `lingerie`, `panties`, `bra`, `stockings`, `corset`, `garter`
  (even if your message is anti-objectification, the tag graph doesn’t care)
* “Caption” ecosystem tags: `caption`, `captioned`, `captionart`
* Words like `innocent`, `wifey`, `tiny`, `training` in tags (they’re magnets, even when your text is critical)

If a garment matters to the story, tag **`costume` / `wardrobe` / `periodcostume`** instead of the specific lingerie item.

---

### A practical rule

**Use 3 layers:**

1. **5 “intent” tags** (agency, solidarity, commentary)
2. **5 “story/setting” tags** (wardrobe, period, travel, train, etc.)
3. **5 “tech/series” tags** (celestesgirl, comfyui, flux, etc.)

That gives you ~15 tags that are *high signal* and not fetish-indexed.

---

If you paste 3–5 of your most common image themes (e.g., “train travel,” “wardrobe work,” “classroom,” “quiet domestic,” “two-girl dialogue”), I’ll build you a **small menu of reusable tag packs** (like presets) so tagging becomes fast and consistent.

## My Bio

Important Note: All my so-called artwork, including any descriptive text, depicts adults doing whatever: no images involve minors. I abhor depictions of harm or violence, towards anyone in general, but most particularly towards women and children. None of the images reflect actual events: all depictions are imaginary.

Artwork and styles change, nothing is permanent. Certain creations - like people - may change or even disappear. I’m revising older deviations to match the direction of my work now: agency, dignity, and real-world empathy. I’m not keeping separate ‘old tone’ uploads. If that earlier direction was what you were here for, it’s probably best to unfollow.

As CelestesGrl, I reserve exclusive ownership of the artworks that I post on Deviant Art. Downloading is permitted for your personal enjoyment as well as creating derivations if so inspired. Permissions for creating derivations (please read):
- You may download my work for personal enjoyment.
- You may create new, transformative derivatives inspired by my work (remixes, reinterpretations, new compositions).
- Please do not reupload near-identical copies (including “same image with denoise/filters/upscale”), as that’s not transformative.

## Prompt Kit

<img src="/assets/images/notes/N251221ad.jpg" style="float: right; width: 540px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Exactly — you’re describing a **prompt kit**: fixed identity + fixed spatial roles + swappable “scene modules”. That’s the cleanest way to get consistency without fighting the model every run.

Here’s a practical template you can literally keep as your default and just swap the bracketed parts.


---
1) The “Two-Person Left/Right” Master Template (single text field)

**IDENTITY + GEOMETRY (fixed)**

> Two women, both adults, full-body or 3/4 body, **two-person scene**.
> **Left: celestesh**, taller, medium skin, long brown hair, confident posture.
> **Right: moimeme3**, shorter, light skin, light brown hair, softer presence.
> Composition: **celestesh on the left, moimeme3 on the right**, clear separation, both faces visible.

You only have to write this once.


---
2) Add your “Wardrobe Modules” (pick one and paste)

### Wardrobe Module A

(period)

> Wardrobe: 18th-century inspired dresses, tasteful, no fetish framing.
> celestesh wears a muted rose-pink linen gown with square neckline and short puff sleeves.
> moimeme3 wears a dark brown off-the-shoulder corset dress with flounced sleeves, embroidered front panel, and a full skirt with tiered ruffled hem.

### Wardrobe Module B

(modern casual)

> Wardrobe: modern casual, tasteful.
> celestesh wears tailored black trousers and a fitted blouse.
> moimeme3 wears a light cardigan and a skirt or jeans.

(Keep 2–3 “modules” tops, otherwise you’ll overthink.)


---
3) The “Scene Slots” you swap each time

* A) Background (swap)

> Setting: [garden hedge + path] / [train platform] / [kitchen] / [library stacks] / [seaside terrace] / [workshop wardrobe room]

Keep it to **one line**.

* B) Blocking & interaction (swap)

Choose one verb phrase style and stick to it:

* “They stand close, angled toward each other, mid-conversation.”
* “celestesh adjusts moimeme3’s sleeve while moimeme3 watches her hands.”
* “moimeme3 hands celestesh a folded note; celestesh reads it with a half-smile.”
* “They walk side-by-side; celestesh speaks, moimeme3 listens.”

One or two actions, no more.

* C) Expression & gaze (swap)

* celestesh: [calm, amused, protective, appraising, sympathetic]
* moimeme3: [nervous, thoughtful, defiant, relieved, curious]

* D) POV / framing (swap)

* “eye-level, medium shot”
* “slight low angle” (gives Celeste authority)
* “over-the-shoulder from celestesh” (Celeste POV emphasis)
* “over-the-shoulder from moimeme3” (rare, if you want vulnerability)

* E) Lighting (swap)

* “soft diffused daylight”
* “overcast, gentle contrast”
* “warm interior lamplight”
* “late afternoon, long soft shadows”


---
4) Put it together: a ready-to-use “fill-in” prompt

Copy/paste this and only edit the ALL CAPS lines:

> Two women, both adults, two-person scene, cinematic realism.
> **Left: celestesh**, taller, medium skin, long brown hair, confident posture.
> **Right: moimeme3**, shorter, light skin, light brown hair, softer presence.
> Composition: celestesh on the left, moimeme3 on the right, both faces visible.
> Wardrobe: [PASTE WARDROBE MODULE].
> Setting: [BACKGROUND].
> Action: [BLOCKING / INTERACTION].
> Expressions: celestesh is [CELESTE EXPRESSION]; moimeme3 is [CHARLIE EXPRESSION].
> Camera: [POV / FRAMING]. Lighting: [LIGHTING]. Shallow depth of field.

That will behave *so* much better than QwenVL prose.


---
5) One extra trick that helps with left/right reliability

Models sometimes mirror. To reduce that:

* Always include: **“celestesh on the left, moimeme3 on the right”**
* Also include: **“taller on the left, shorter on the right”**
* And in the action line, refer to left/right again:

  * “The taller woman on the left looks down slightly at the shorter woman on the right.”

Redundancy *here* is good — it’s a hard constraint.


---
6) If you want, I’ll build you 10 “scene modules”

Give me 3–5 settings you use a lot (e.g., *garden, wardrobe room, train station, seaside terrace, classroom*), and I’ll write:

* 10 background lines
* 10 interaction lines
* 10 expression pairs
  …all in the same consistent syntax so you can mix-and-match like LEGO.

No web browsing needed, and it’ll make your prompting feel like operating a rig instead of wrestling a muse.

## CLIP Fields

<img src="/assets/images/notes/N251221ae.jpg" style="float: right; width: 540px;
        margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" />

Perfect — if your workflow has **two separate CLIP text fields** (one per LoRA hook) and then concatenates them, you can still use a “scene module” system cleanly.

The trick is to split your text into:

1. a **Shared Scene Block** (same words in both fields), and
2. a **Character Block** (only that person’s identity/wardrobe/pose notes)

That way, both encodes “know” the setting and interaction, but each hook field stays loyal to its own character.

Below are **10 ready-made scene modules** (each with Setting + Action + Expressions + Camera + Lighting), plus a reusable **Shared Scene Block template**, and then **Celeste**/**Charlie** blocks you can keep fixed.


---
**How to structure your two CLIP fields**

### Shared Scene Block 
(paste this into BOTH CLIP text fields)

Use this exact scaffold and swap only the bracket parts:

**SHARED SCENE BLOCK**

* two women, adults, cinematic realism, natural proportions
* celestesh on the left, taller on the left; moimeme4 on the right, shorter on the right
* both faces visible, clear separation, coherent anatomy, hands plausible
* **Setting:** [module setting line]
* **Action:** [module action line]
* **Expressions:** [module expression line]
* **Camera:** [module camera line]
* **Lighting:** [module lighting line]

Why both fields? Because once concatenated, you want the combined conditioning to agree on the “world” and the blocking. If only one field contains the scene, the other hook sometimes “hallucinates” its own.

### Celeste CLIP field
(Celeste-only block)

Paste after the Shared Scene Block in the **celestesh** field:

**CELESTE BLOCK**

* celestesh, taller, confident posture, composed presence
* wardrobe: muted rose-pink linen gown, square neckline, short puff sleeves, small buttons down the bodice, delicate pendant necklace
* hair: long brown hair, simple braid detail, tidy and intentional
* avoid fetish framing, respectful tone, character-focused

### Charlie CLIP field
(Charlie-only block)

Paste after the Shared Scene Block in the **moimeme4** field:

**CHARLIE BLOCK**

* moimeme4, shorter, softer presence, attentive posture
* wardrobe: dark brown off-the-shoulder corset dress, flounced sleeves, embroidered front panel, full skirt with tiered ruffled hem, pearl stud earrings
* hair: light brown hair in a loose updo, neat but slightly imperfect
* avoid fetish framing, respectful tone, character-focused

**Important:** In the Celeste field, don’t include “moimeme4” as a keyword (and vice versa) unless you need it for left/right. Over-mentioning the other identity can cause bleed.

---

**10 scene modules you can plug in**

Each module below is written as 5 lines to paste into the Shared Scene Block.


---
1) — Garden hedge, whispered check-in

* **Setting:** quiet garden path with tall green hedge, a few roses, soft background blur
* **Action:** celestesh leans slightly toward moimeme4 as if giving calm advice; moimeme4 turns her shoulders toward celestesh, listening
* **Expressions:** celestesh is gently amused and steady; moimeme4 is thoughtful, a little unsure but receptive
* **Camera:** eye-level medium shot, both in frame, slight emphasis on celestesh as the anchor
* **Lighting:** soft diffused daylight, no harsh shadows, shallow depth of field


---
2) — Wardrobe workroom, competence in motion

* **Setting:** wardrobe workroom, bolts of fabric, ribbons, sewing table, labeled drawers, tidy clutter
* **Action:** celestesh holds up a garment for inspection; moimeme4 steadies the hem with careful hands, both focused on the same detail
* **Expressions:** celestesh is appraising and satisfied; moimeme4 is concentrated, quietly proud of getting it right
* **Camera:** three-quarter view, hands and fabric visible, faces still readable
* **Lighting:** warm interior lamplight, practical and realistic, gentle contrast


---
3) — Train platform, “move like you belong”

* **Setting:** train platform with a bench, timetable signage, distant commuters blurred, period-costume contrast implied
* **Action:** celestesh stands between moimeme4 and the open space, subtly shielding; moimeme4 adjusts her skirt and steadies her posture
* **Expressions:** celestesh is calm and protective without fuss; moimeme4 is apprehensive but trying to look composed
* **Camera:** slightly wider shot, full-body or 3/4, so posture and clothing read clearly
* **Lighting:** overcast daylight or late afternoon softness, gentle shadows


---
4) — Seaside terrace, big talk without melodrama

* **Setting:** seaside terrace overlooking water, railing, wind-touched hair, distant horizon
* **Action:** celestesh gestures toward the horizon as she speaks; moimeme4 holds the railing lightly, listening, half-turned toward celestesh
* **Expressions:** celestesh is earnest and persuasive; moimeme4 is conflicted but attentive, weighing the cost
* **Camera:** medium-wide, slight low angle that gives celestesh quiet authority
* **Lighting:** cool coastal daylight, soft highlights, no glossy “romance poster” vibe


---
5) — Donor reception, polite danger

* **Setting:** elegant hall or garden reception, blurred guests, a suggestion of wealth and scrutiny
* **Action:** celestesh greets someone off-camera with poised confidence; moimeme4 stands half a step behind, attentive, hands folded naturally
* **Expressions:** celestesh is socially flawless with a private edge; moimeme4 is neutral and careful, reading the room
* **Camera:** shoulder-level framing, celestesh slightly forward in composition, both faces visible
* **Lighting:** warm event lighting, soft bokeh, realistic


---
6) — Corridor pause, “are you okay?”

* **Setting:** quiet corridor outside wardrobe/rooms, doors and wall sconces, hush of backstage space
* **Action:** celestesh turns moimeme4 gently by the elbow to face her; moimeme4 exhales and nods, as if admitting something
* **Expressions:** celestesh is concerned but controlled; moimeme4 is relieved to be checked on, still tense
* **Camera:** close-medium, intimate but not romanticized; emphasis on faces and small gestures
* **Lighting:** dimmer interior light with soft falloff, calm mood


---
7) — Garden bench, practical coaching

* **Setting:** garden bench near trimmed hedges, gravel path, a place for quiet instruction
* **Action:** celestesh demonstrates skirt movement with a small step and hand placement; moimeme4 mirrors her, concentrating
* **Expressions:** celestesh is gently directive, almost teacher-like; moimeme4 is focused, slightly embarrassed but determined
* **Camera:** full-body or 3/4 to show leg/skirt mechanics clearly, both centered
* **Lighting:** late afternoon sun filtered through leaves, soft and believable


---
8) — Mirror check, “does this read as natural?”

* **Setting:** dressing area with a tall mirror, fabric draped over a chair, pins and combs on a table
* **Action:** moimeme4 looks at her reflection, hands still; celestesh stands beside her, adjusting one small detail near the shoulder or collar
* **Expressions:** celestesh is precise and reassuring; moimeme4 is wary but calmer after the adjustment
* **Camera:** mirror-inclusive composition (no weird reflections), medium shot, faces clear
* **Lighting:** clean indoor light, neutral warmth, realistic skin tones


---
9) — Rain at the windows, confidential tone

* **Setting:** interior room with rain-streaked windows, muted background, soft hush
* **Action:** celestesh speaks low, hands loosely clasped; moimeme4 sits or stands close, listening with full attention
* **Expressions:** celestesh is reflective, slightly softened; moimeme4 is serious, quietly moved
* **Camera:** close-medium, stable framing, minimal background distraction
* **Lighting:** gray daylight from window, soft shadows, subdued palette

---
10) — After-hours tidy-up, shared ritual

* **Setting:** wardrobe room after closing, neatly stacked garments, empty hangers, swept floor, calm order
* **Action:** celestesh hands moimeme4 folded fabric; moimeme4 accepts it carefully, their hands briefly aligning on the same bundle
* **Expressions:** celestesh is quietly satisfied, fond in a restrained way; moimeme4 is grateful, steadier than before
* **Camera:** medium shot, hands visible, faces visible, balanced composition
* **Lighting:** warm practical light, end-of-day calm

---

**Complete “assembled” example (ready to paste)

### Celeste CLIP field example

* two women, adults, cinematic realism, natural proportions
* celestesh on the left, taller on the left; moimeme4 on the right, shorter on the right
* both faces visible, clear separation, coherent anatomy, hands plausible
* Setting: wardrobe workroom, bolts of fabric, ribbons, sewing table, labeled drawers, tidy clutter
* Action: celestesh holds up a garment for inspection; moimeme4 steadies the hem with careful hands, both focused on the same detail
* Expressions: celestesh is appraising and satisfied; moimeme4 is concentrated, quietly proud of getting it right
* Camera: three-quarter view, hands and fabric visible, faces still readable
* Lighting: warm interior lamplight, practical and realistic, gentle contrast
* celestesh, taller, confident posture, composed presence
* wardrobe: muted rose-pink linen gown, square neckline, short puff sleeves, small buttons down the bodice, delicate pendant necklace
* hair: long brown hair, simple braid detail, tidy and intentional
* avoid fetish framing, respectful tone, character-focused

### Charlie CLIP field example

(same Shared Scene Block, then:)

* moimeme4, shorter, softer presence, attentive posture
* wardrobe: dark brown off-the-shoulder corset dress, flounced sleeves, embroidered front panel, full skirt with tiered ruffled hem, pearl stud earrings
* hair: light brown hair in a loose updo, neat but slightly imperfect
* avoid fetish framing, respectful tone, character-focused

---

**If you want to push “Celeste POV” without changing workflow**

Add one line (in BOTH fields) in the Shared Scene Block:

* **Camera:** slight over-the-shoulder from celestesh, celestesh foreground soft, moimeme4 midground sharp, celestesh still readable

That tends to preserve the “Celeste is the lens” feeling while still keeping both faces intact.

---

If you tell me the **top 3 recurring locations** you want (e.g., *train platform, wardrobe room, garden, seaside terrace, classroom*), I can generate **another 20 modules** tailored to those settings, including a few “high tension but clean” variants (donor scrutiny, staff corridor, public gaze) that keep the story’s social bite without feeding the wrong audience.
