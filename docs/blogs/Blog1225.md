**03.Dec.2025**  
I've been a member for a week. My gallery is a mix of different ideas: period scenes and feminisation scenarios and even music. So far (11:35am) I have 47 'deviations', 1664 profile views and 171 watchers.

All in one week.

 Un-freakin'-believable.
 
 Of course, the tame images get only a few views: it's the 'feminise' stuff that seems most popular. And yet, when I look at other members' galleries, my stuff is truly tame. As in: nothing really objectionable (p\*rn).
 
 My aim is humour and enlightenment: the LGBTQ+ community are so demonised while at the same time eroticised that humour doesn't seem a thing. But, it is. We can laugh at ourselves. Even while we're crying, inside.
 
 My goal is to, to the best of my ability and with the limited resources I have, amplify the lived experience of a woman to all the TG-attracted blokes on DA. No frilly maid's dresses, no Loctober or Cuck stuff. Too much is made of having a gynarchy rule the world, when most blokes can't even tolerate having their views questioned. It's all horseshit. Right now, 180-odd transgender-attracted or cross-dressing or fem-dreaming blokes (pretty sure it's all blokes...ewww!) are following me. I will eventually disappoint them. It will be a slow grind towards pointing out the true lived experience of an AFAB person, and I really think that cold, hard exposure to that reality will end up popping a lot of 'girly-fantasy' balloons. It's all in the interest of education, helping to cross the gender divide, of course. Will I succeed? Unlikely... once the male fantasy is no longer addressed, they move on. No dopamine hit. No erotic tingle. Bo-o-oring.
 
 We'll see.
