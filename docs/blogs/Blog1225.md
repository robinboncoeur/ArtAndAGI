## DeviantArt

**03.Dec.2025**  
I've been a member for a week. My gallery is a mix of different ideas: period scenes and feminisation scenarios and even music. So far (11:35am) I have 47 'deviations', 1664 profile views and 171 watchers.

All in one week.

Un-freakin'-believable.

Of course, the tame images get only a few views: it's the 'feminise' stuff that seems most popular. And yet, when I look at other members' galleries, my stuff is truly tame. As in: nothing really objectionable (p\*rn).
 
My aim is humour and enlightenment: the LGBTQ+ community are so demonised while at the same time eroticised that humour doesn't seem a thing. But, it is. We can laugh at ourselves. Even while we're crying, inside.
 
My goal is to, to the best of my ability and with the limited resources I have, amplify the lived experience of a woman to all the TG-attracted blokes on DA. No frilly maid's dresses, no Loctober or Cuck stuff. Too much is made of having a gynarchy rule the world, when most blokes can't even tolerate having their views questioned. It's all horseshit. Right now, 180-odd transgender-attracted or cross-dressing or fem-dreaming blokes (pretty sure it's mostly blokes...) are following me. I will eventually disappoint them. It will be a slow grind towards pointing out the true lived experience of an AFAB person, and I really think that cold, hard exposure to that reality will end up popping a lot of 'girly-fantasy' balloons. It's all in the interest of education, helping to cross the gender divide, of course. Will I succeed? Unlikely... once the male fantasy is no longer addressed, they move on. No dopamine hit. No erotic tingle. Bo-o-oring.
 
We'll see.

## That Honeymoon Glow

**09.Dec.2025**  
<a href="/assets/images/blog25/13-1Demoiselle.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

I was sort-of getting over DeviantArt by the 3rd. One 'lass' whose name trumpets 'her' proclivity for quaffing, well, I'd rather not say - just leave it to a repulsed imagination - keeps commenting on my images, making it all about 'her'. Poor thing. I wish I could say that those 244 Watchers were comprised of the finest and the best society has to offer, but I would be trifling with the truth. Some *are*, certainly.

The site has racked up 2.3k **individual viewer** views. One image in particular has been quite popular: 11.2k views... 130 have copied it to their "Favourite" folders. Of course I had to have a peek at their folders, their galleries. Which resulted in this feeling I was sort-of done with DeviantArt.

Still on the fence about that.

Set up AI-Toolkit in Windows 11: this will allow creating LoRAs for Z-Image-Turbo, which has become all the rage. Whilst there seems to be a new model coming out every few days which blows everything else out of the water, this one truly ticks a LOT of boxes. Will run on Low VRAM systems. Generates high-quality accurate images in almost no time at all. SDXL was the goto vision model for *years*: I reckon this one will take its place, if it hasn't already.

I tried running the .safetensor version on another PC using an 8gig VRAM card. Well, I don't think 8gig is actually available, based on what I'm reading in terminal. However, the .GGUFs do load, so there's that.

## Z-Image, the New SDXL

**15.Dec.2025**  
Absolutely! Super-powerful, highly accurate, easy to make LoRAs for, runs on the smell of an oily rag: what's not to like. Also, NSFW... which means: no restictions.

I posted (twice) a question I was having on the LoRA Hook nodes, which were central to my 2-character consistent face workflow, but with Z-Image, I rather think this is going to become a moot issue. I might try to find a solution in that arena instead.

The next challenge is going to be: build character LoRAs in Z-Image. Time-consuming but doable on my system, apparently.

## Changing the Look

**15.Dec.2025**  

Default tags

*Series / identity*

celeste charlie celesteandcharlie originalcharacters oc serialstory (or series)

*Writing / narrative*

microfiction storytelling dialogue characterstudy comingofage satire subtext powerdynamics friendship psychological

Theme / lens

identity

selfimage

genderexpression

transformation (neutral word; not the fetish-coded ones)

confidence

socialcommentary

Visual / medium (keep these if you want AI discoverability)

aiart

photorealistic (only if it truly is)

That’s 26–28 already, depending on which you keep.

Add-on mini packs (pick 3–6 depending on the post)
A) If it’s a school/uni scene

schoollife

teenfiction

sliceoflife

B) If fashion/costume is central

fashion

wardrobe

costumedesign

historicalfashion

patternmaking

textiles

C) If it’s more “mood / cinematic still”

cinematic

softlight

interiors

twowomen

Tags I’d avoid (your “don’t ring the dinner bell” list)

These are the ones that tend to act like magnets for the audience you’ve said you don’t want:

feminization (you’ve already seen this effect) 
DeviantArt

reluctant (same story) 
DeviantArt

anything like sissy, forcedfem, humiliation, punishment, training, crossdress (even if “technically accurate”)

You can still write the plot—just don’t use the niche’s “index terms.”

A tiny workflow that makes this easy

Make a note file called DA Tags – Default (base set).

Make DA Tags – Fashion and DA Tags – School/Uni (add-ons).

Each post: paste base → add 3–6 add-ons → remove anything that doesn’t truly apply.

DA’s own tag guidance emphasizes relevant tags for discovery, not just “more tags.” 
DeviantArt

If you want, paste the tag list from 2–3 of your most typical Celeste/Charlie posts (just the tags, no links needed) and I’ll “tune” this pack to your exact recurring motifs—so you end up with a signature set that’s consistent across the series.
