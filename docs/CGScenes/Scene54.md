✨ Forsaken Studies ✨

[Celeste POV]

I sat curled up in the window seat that doubled as storage, staring unseeing out at the autumn leaves, the wind blowing empty branches about, sipping my morning flat white. Charli made the best flat-whites: they had splurged on a used expresso coffee maker. It was built in Italy, over ten years old but still looked brand-new.

And it produced brilliant expressos. And flat-whites. And, Charli's favourite, mochas.

Charli was in the laundry, which also served as pantry, putting a load of washing on. She wasn't meant to be out and about as this was my study period, but almost all those rules seemed irrelevant, now.

The rules had been designed to protect me. Protect Charli too, of course, but when they were written, it was for a lad moving in with a young woman. And designed for a conventional sort of lad, one requiring strict guidelines, with consequences.

Not I or Mara or even Lauren truly knew this person, Charli.

I had another sip and stared malevolently at my textbook. I could sense my studies frowned back, feeling slighted. I just wasn't in a headspace for statistics and gantt charts.

All I could think of was--magic. The pure, simple, fiery enchantment of a touch: Charli's touch.

That first time I touched her hand... in the loos. I think I must have introduced myself... I can't remember. What I do remember was how light, almost subtanceless her hand felt in mine, long before I knew of 'she'.

If I had known then, would I--

My breath caught, suddenly aware of the emotion cliff's edge I was strolling carelessly along.

Charli emerged from the laundry carrying the clothes backet with wet clothes. Her face brightened into a quick, bewitching smile before she disappeared into the room that had been her bedroom, but was now ostensibly the study.

I'm pretty sure she'd seen through my ruse. And when I told her... that melt, that doe-eyed delight that she couldn't get up the courage to express.

I had another sip: it was cooling too fast. And I like savouring, not greedy guzzling. With pretty much everything--shopping for clothes, exploring a new restaurant, trying for a new look with a more expensive eyeshadow--but when it came to Charli, my hunger for her had grown like a nettle in a part of the garden you avoid because of nettles. 

I didn't recognise myself.

I felt slightly dizzy, and everything around me stop when I remembered that first kiss.

Charli was humming to herself... some Russian melody she'd become enchanted by.

I was enchanted by... her.

The kiss... yes, it was ever so sweet. But it was her, so melting, so yielding, so... feminine. I swallowed, my vision going tunnel, just at the thought. Yes, that was it: it was her yielding to me as much as her touch that I found completely irresistible.

[26-01-23]

**Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.

[26-02-18]

**Scene 54 — “Terms” (Celeste POV, 1st person, past tense)**

By lunchtime, the decision had started to crystallise into something worse than an abstract: logistics.

If I thought about it as a story problem—who do you send to set up a new Wardrobe from scratch?—the answer was obvious. If I thought about it as my actual life—who do you uproot for a month and sleep without?—the answer was unbearable.

So I did what Mara always told us to do with fabric we were scared of cutting.

“You put it flat on the table,” she’d say, hands smoothing cloth, “and you cut where the lines are. Not where your nerves are.”

I ordered Thai from the place around the corner that knew our address by heart, texted Sarah and Charli to stop sewing at noon, and cleared the end of the big worktable. When the food arrived, I set out three plastic containers, three forks, three napkins. No plates. This was not a dinner-with-ambience conversation. This was triage.

Sarah came in first, wiping her hands on a tea towel, hair up, pencil still tucked behind one ear.

“Smells like you’re about to make us do something hard,” she said, dropping into the chair opposite me.

“Pad see ew makes everything better,” I said. “It’s science.”

Charli arrived a beat later, cheeks pink from the iron, thread on her shirt. She clocked the arrangement—the takeaway, the three chairs, my phone face-down on the table—and her eyes did that quick, wide flicker that meant her nervous system had already jumped ahead.

“What’s wrong?” she asked, before she’d even sat down.

“Come, sit,” I said. “Food first. Talk with food.”

She slid into the chair next to Sarah, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. I watched the way Sarah shifted automatically to make room for her, the small, quiet protection in it. It helped. A little.

We opened containers. The smell of garlic and chilli swam up, mixing with steam and the linen-and-wool of the room.

I waited until they both had food on their forks, something to do with their hands.

“Right,” I said. “I had a call from Queensland this morning. Their operations woman—Fiona. You’ll like her. Mildly chaotic, but in the right direction.”

Sarah lifted an eyebrow. “And?”

“And they are on track to open,” I said. “Site coming together, actors being cast, crates due to land on schedule. That part’s fine.”

Charli relaxed by maybe two percent. I watched it happen: shoulders down a fraction, jaw unclench.

“But,” I said, “their in-house Wardrobe team is… theoretical.”

Sarah snorted softly. “As in: staffed by enthusiasm and vibes?”

“As in three twenty-somethings who are great at content, less great at flatlining a wool coat,” I said. “Fiona’s not an idiot. She knows they’re green. She also knows what we’re sending up there represents five years of our labour, and she doesn’t want it destroyed in the first fortnight because someone put a steam iron on full blast over a silk ribbon.”

“That would be bad,” Charli murmured.

“Catastrophic,” Sarah said, deadpan.

I took a breath.

“She asked,” I went on, “if we would consider sending up a couple of experienced people for the first month. To set up their systems properly, train the team, receive stock, troubleshoot, be the on-site brain. Flights, accommodation, per diems, consulting fee. The works.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened. “And by ‘experienced people’ she means…?”

“Someone who understands outerwear and fittings,” I said, looking at her. “And someone who’s lived in the clothes. Who knows what they feel like on a working body in heat, how they move, where they chafe. Someone who can say ‘that hem will trip them on gravel’ before it happens.”

Charli stared at me. Fork forgotten mid-air.

“Oh,” she said, very small.

There was a beat of quiet where all you could hear was the fan and someone in the next workroom over swearing at a stapler.

Sarah broke it first, because of course she did.

“Okay,” she said. “Firstly: yes, that’s exactly what they need. Secondly: timeline?”

“Crates land mid-month,” I said. “They’d like people a few days before stock arrives, so you can set up and not be unpacking blind. Then about four weeks on site. Enough to get them through opening and the first two weekends, maybe three, so you can see what breaks under actual human use.”

Sarah nodded, as if I’d just laid out the steps for binding a bodice.

“And you’re thinking me and Charli,” she said. Again, not a question.

“You’re the natural choice,” I said. “You’re the best we have at fitting and outerwear, you’ve got the calm of a mountain, and you’ve already stared down one Queensland man with wandering hands and won. And Charli—”

“I know how the clothes behave when you’re working in them,” Charli said faintly.

“Yes,” I said. “You know where they actually bind when you carry a crate, which seams take the strain when you run across gravel, how it feels to be in that coat in thirty degrees. They can’t learn that from email.”

She put her fork down very carefully on the napkin, like her fingers had forgotten how to grip.

“You want us to go,” she said.

I wanted to say *no, I want to lock you in the linen cupboard until Queensland has learned manners*. But that wasn’t leadership. That was panic in a nice dress.

“I want you to have the choice,” I said instead. “Both of you. I am not Nigel. I do not pack bags and announce decisions. I lay out the reality and you tell me if it’s a yes, a no, or a not-yet.”

Charli’s eyes flicked down at the name and back up. Sarah’s mouth tightened in a way that said she’d noticed, too.

“What’s the reality?” Sarah asked. “Let’s have it clean.”

“Reality is,” I said, “I can’t go. I’m in my last semester; if I vanish for a month, I do not graduate. Mara has to stay here to finish the last pieces, oversee shipping, and put systems in place for when stock needs repair or replacement. The juniors are nowhere near ready to be thrown into a brand-new Wardrobe without supervision.”

I looked at both of them.

“That leaves you,” I said quietly. “You are the top of the list. For skill, for temperament, for understanding the work. If I send anyone else, I will be lying to them and to Queensland about what we can actually offer. And I don’t do that.”

Sarah watched me for a long moment over the rim of her plastic container.

“Okay,” she said eventually. “Here’s my position, for the record: I’m in.”

Charli’s head snapped towards her.

“Just like that?” she blurted.

Sarah shrugged.

“It’s what I’m good at,” she said. “I can set up a Wardrobe with my eyes half shut. I know how to talk to builders and managers and baby actors without murdering anyone. I like the idea that if our work is going to be paraded around in Queensland heat, I’m there to stop them hanging it on rusty nails.”

She speared a piece of broccoli, chewed, swallowed.

“And honestly,” she added, “the idea of watching a brand-new team find their feet with the right tools? That’s my idea of a good time.”

I hadn’t even had to ask.

Charli was still staring at her.

“You’re not… scared?” she asked.

Sarah snorted. “Of Queensland? Always. That’s just common sense.”

A tiny smile twitched at the corner of Charli’s mouth despite everything.

“But,” Sarah went on, gentler, “this is a job I can do with both hands tied. I’ve been in more male-coded spaces than I can count. I know the signs. I know when to escalate. And I know that if I call Celeste and say ‘pull us out’, she will have those crates on a return truck so fast the QLD director will get whiplash.”

“Correct,” I said. “That is an explicit term. If either of you say, *this is not safe*, I pull you. No debate. No ‘are you sure’. Word for word.”

Charli’s throat moved. She looked at me at last, really looked, and I could see it click: that this was costing me as much as her, that every muscle in my body wanted to say *stay* and I was holding it open anyway.

“You’re finding this really hard,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. No point pretending otherwise. “I don’t like the idea of sleeping without you for a month. I don’t like the idea of you being in a place where I can’t get to you in under half an hour. I hate it, actually.”

Her eyes shone.

“Then why—”

“Because you are good at this,” I cut in, softly. “Because your skills are not decorative. They are not an optional extra. You see things in the clothes the rest of them won’t. You know what it takes to live in them. That is knowledge some bright, green twenty-two-year-old up there desperately needs, and she can’t get it from a PDF.”

Sarah nodded. “We can’t teach ‘what it feels like to be touched in this coat on a hot day’ over Zoom,” she said. “We can, however, take Charli up there, and have her stand next to a girl and say, ‘Listen. When the tourist puts his hand here, this is what you will feel. This is how you shift. This is what you’re allowed to say.’”

Charli winced, but she didn’t look away.

“It’s a month,” I said. “Shorter, if it’s intolerable. There will be clearly defined boundaries in the contract. Fiona is already on our side; she’s asking for help because she wants to get it right, not because she wants to wring extra labour out of you.”

I forced myself to unclench my hand on the fork, to put it down instead of snapping the plastic.

“You would have your own accommodation,” I went on. “Not bunking with actors. Not stuck in some mixed dorm. A small flat or two motel rooms next to each other. Daily check-ins with me. Weekly debrief with Mara. And a clear exit clause. If at any point you say, ‘enough’, there’s no guilt, no ‘letting us down’. We reconfigure. We adapt. We are not the patriarchy; we do not demand loyalty at the expense of sanity.”

Charli’s fingers had folded into her palms so tightly the knuckles were white. She stared at the noodles in front of her as if they might rearrange into a more palatable future.

“I don’t want to leave you,” she said, so quietly I almost missed it under the fan.

“I don’t want you to leave,” I said. That part was easy. “But I also don’t want to clip you down to the shape of my fear.”

Her head jerked at that; I could see the word land.

“I trust Sarah to have your back,” I said. “I trust you to know your limits. And I trust myself to listen if you say ‘no more’. That’s the only way this works.”

The silence that followed wasn’t empty. It was full of calculations: trains of thought I could almost see moving behind her eyes.

“If I say no,” she said slowly, “what happens?”

“We respect it,” I said. “We tell Fiona that our people are exhausted from production, that we can offer remote support only. We tighten our documentation, write clearer guides, accept that Queensland’s learning curve will be steeper. No one dies. No one hates you. The world does not fall apart.”

Sarah nodded, backing me without missing a beat. “We’re not going to stand around saying ‘you should have gone’ for the next three years,” she said. “That’s not how we operate.”

Charli bit her lip. “And if I say yes?”

“Then you and I,” I said, “spend the next few weeks making sure you’re as prepared as possible. Practically and emotionally. We talk through worst-case scenarios and their scripts until they’re boring. We practise you saying ‘that’s not okay’ out loud without apologising afterwards. We line up small pleasures for when you come back. And then you go up there for a month, do something only you can do, and come home.”

Her eyes filled properly then, tears gathering on the lower lashes.

“I’m scared,” she admitted.

“I would be worried if you weren’t,” Sarah said dryly. “But you will not be alone. No one is throwing you into a loading bay and shutting the door.”

I reached across the table, slowly enough that she could see my hand coming, and laid it palm-up between us.

“If you decide you want to do this,” I said, “you won’t be proving anything to me. You don’t owe me a month in Queensland as some kind of loyalty tithe. You will be choosing to lend your skills to women who need them. That’s it. That’s the whole story.”

She looked at my hand. At Sarah. Back at me.

“I want to be that person,” she whispered. “The one who can go and help and come back and not fall apart.”

“You already are that person,” I said. “You proved it the day you said ‘could you step back a bit, please’ to that courier. This would just be a… longer-distance version.”

A tear slipped over and down her cheek. She scrubbed it away with the heel of her hand, annoyed at it.

“I hate that this is so hard,” she muttered.

“Good,” Sarah said. “Means you’re not treating yourself like a piece of luggage.”

Charli made a wet, helpless sound that might have been a laugh.

“Can I… think about it?” she asked. “Like… overnight?”

“Of course,” I said, relief loosening something in my spine. “Fiona asked for an answer within the week. I told her I would not rush my people. Take tonight. Take two nights. Talk to Lauren if you want. Make a list. Colour-code it. Whatever you need.”

She nodded, once. Twice. Then put her fork back into her food with the expression of someone doing it just to keep from shaking.

Sarah reached across and nudged her shoulder with the back of her hand.

“Hey,” she said quietly. “If we go, we go as a team. I’m not dragging a shaken mouse around Queensland. I’m going with you. You’ve seen me with men who think the world is their locker room. I’m very educational.”

Charli snorted, involuntarily.

“There she is,” Sarah said, satisfied. “That’s the face I want to see when we step off the plane. The one that thinks, ‘this will be awful and also we are going to do it properly’.”

We finished lunch in a kind of thoughtful quiet. No one forced cheer. No one pretended this was nothing. When we were done, Charli busied herself stacking containers for the bin like it was the most complicated task in the world.

As they dispersed back to their stations, I caught her for a second at the doorway.

“Charli?”

She turned, eyes already a little red.

“Whatever you decide,” I said, “I am proud of you.”

Her chin wobbled. She gave me a small, ragged nod and fled back to her machine.

---

That night, the bed felt wrong before we’d even turned the light off.

We’d gone through the motions of dinner, dishes, showers, pyjamas, like normal. We’d even watched half an episode of something forgettable. But the conversation hovered over us like humidity.

In the dark, lying on our sides facing each other, I could just make out the faint shine of her eyes.

“I think I’m going to say yes,” she whispered.

The words were soft, but they hit like a hammer and like a blessing at the same time.

“Okay,” I breathed. My throat tightened. “Are you sure?”

“No,” she said honestly. “But I don’t think I’m ever going to feel sure about something like this. I just… when I imagined telling Fiona no, I felt small. When I imagined telling her yes, I felt… sick. And big. At the same time.”

“That sounds about right,” I said thickly.

“I don’t want you to be alone,” she added, voice cracking. “I hate the thought of you here without me.”

“I won’t be alone,” I said. “I’ll have Mara and Lauren and a workroom full of women and a timetable that wants me dead. And my phone. Which will be glued to my hand, by the way.”

Her hand found the front of my T-shirt and bunched the fabric up, fingers knotting there like she could anchor herself to the cotton.

“And at night?” she asked.

“At night,” I said, “I will be lying in a bed that feels too big, texting you stupid memes and waiting for you to come back and make fun of my taste in television. It will hurt. I’m not going to pretend it won’t. But it will be a hurt with an end date.”

A hot tear slid over my nose; I realised, with a small, exasperated shock, that I was crying first.

“Look at us,” I muttered, trying to laugh and failing. “Scene 52 had nothing on this.”

Charli let out a half-sob, half-giggle.

“I’m sorry,” she said, swiping at her face. “I’m trying to be brave.”

“You are being brave,” I said. “Brave people cry all the time. You think Mara didn’t cry after she told that Melbourne manager we were walking if he didn’t fix the contract? She just did it in the toilet, like a professional.”

That got an actual, wet laugh out of her.

We edged closer until our foreheads touched, breaths mingling in the small pocket of air between us. Her tears dampened my skin. Mine dampened hers. There was nothing glamorous about it; we sniffed and hiccuped and clung.

“I’m going to miss you so much,” she whispered into my T-shirt.

“I’m going to miss you so much I’m already annoyed with myself about it,” I said.

We didn’t talk logistics any more that night. No dates, no packing lists, no scripts. Just the raw fact of it, sitting between us like a third body in the bed.

At some point, the tears slowed. Her grip on my shirt loosened into a curl of fingers rather than a fist. My own breathing evened out against my will. We cried each other towards sleep, not in some cinematic flood, but in stuttering waves that left us both wrung-out and, eventually, too tired to keep holding ourselves upright against the inevitable.

As I drifted, the thought that had settled in my chest after the loading bay came back, reshaped.

*Resilience isn’t doing hard things without crying,* I realised drowsily. *It’s doing them, crying, and doing them anyway—because you know someone will be there on the other end.*

In a few weeks, if all went to plan, that someone would be me, waiting at an arrivals gate with a stupid sign and eyes that had forgotten how to be dry.

For now, it was just the two of us in our too-small bed, clutching damp cotton and trying to sleep around the ache of the future.

**Scene 54 — “Terms” (Celeste POV, 1st person, past tense)**

By lunchtime, the decision had started to crystallise into something rigid: cold logistics.

If I thought about it as a story problem—who do you send to set up a new Wardrobe from scratch?—the answer was obvious. If I thought about it as my actual life—who do you uproot for a month and sleep without?—the answer was unbearable.

So I did what Mara always told us to do with fabric we were scared of cutting.

“You put it flat on the table,” she’d say, hands smoothing cloth, “and you cut where the lines are. Not where your nerves are.”

I ordered Thai from the place around the corner that knew our address by heart, texted Sarah and Charli to stop sewing at noon, and cleared the end of the big worktable. When the food arrived, I set out three plastic containers, three forks, three napkins. No plates. This was not a dinner-with-ambience conversation. This was triage.

Sarah came in first, wiping her hands on a tea towel, hair up, pencil still tucked behind one ear.

“Smells like you’re about to make us do something hard,” she said, dropping into the chair opposite me.

“*Chicken pad see ew* makes everything more palatable,” I said. “It’s science.”

Charli arrived a beat later, cheeks pink from the iron, thread on her shirt. She clocked the arrangement—the takeaway, the three chairs, my phone face-down on the table—and her eyes did that quick, wide flicker that meant her nervous system had already jumped ahead.

“What’s up?” she asked, before she’d even sat down.

“Come, sit,” I said. “Food first. Talk with food.”

She slid into the chair next to Sarah, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. I watched the way Sarah shifted automatically to make room for her, the small, quiet protection in it. It helped. A little.

We opened containers. The smell of garlic and chilli swam up, mixing with steam and the linen-and-wool of the room.

I waited until they both had food on their forks, something to do with their hands.

“Right,” I said. “So, I had a call from Queensland this morning. Had a chat to their operations woman—Fiona. You’d like her. Mildly chaotic, but in the right direction.”

Sarah lifted an eyebrow. “And?”

“And they are on track to open,” I said. “Site coming together, actors being cast, crates due to land on schedule. That bit’s all good.”

Charli relaxed by maybe two percent. I watched it happen: shoulders down a fraction, jaw unclench.

“So, Fiona is putting together an in-house Wardrobe team,” I said, “which at the moment is… theoretical.”

Sarah snorted softly. “As in: staffed by enthusiasm and hope?”

“As in—three twenty-somethings who are great at creating online content, less great at flatlining a wool coat,” I said. “Fiona’s not an idiot. She knows they’re green. She also knows what we’re sending up there represents at least five years of our labour, and she doesn’t want it destroyed in the first fortnight because someone tried to repair a wool jacket with a stapler.”

“That would be bad,” Charli murmured.

“Staples can leave nasty scratches,” Sarah said, deadpan.

I took a breath.

“She *asked—nicely*,” I went on, “whether we would consider sending up a couple of experienced people for the first month. To set up their systems properly, train the team, receive stock, troubleshoot, be the on-site brain. They would sort flights, accommodation, per diems, consulting fee. The lot.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened. “And by ‘experienced people’ she means…?”

“Someone who understands outerwear and fittings,” I said, looking at her. “And someone who’s lived in the clothes. Who knows what they feel like on a working body when it's thirty and humid, how they’re meant to move, where they’re most likely to chafe. Someone who can say ‘that hem will trip them on gravel’ before the actress face-plants.”

Charli stared at me. Fork forgotten mid-air.

“Oh, I see,” she said, very small.

There was a beat of quiet where all you could hear was the fan and someone in the next workroom over swearing at a sewing machine bunching thread.

Sarah broke it first, because of course she did.

“Right-o,” she said brightly. “First: yes, that’s exactly what they need. Second: timeline?”

“our crates will land in Maleny mid-month,” I said. “They’d like people a few days before stock arrives, so you can be set up and not behind the eight-ball. Then about four weeks on site. Enough to get them through opening and the first two weekends, maybe three, so you can see what breaks under actual human use.”

Sarah nodded, as if I’d just laid out the steps for binding a bodice.

“And you’re thinking me and Charli,” she said. Again, not a question.

“You’re the obvious choice,” I said. “You’re the best we’ve got at fittings and outerwear. You’re unflappable, and you’ve already dealt with one bloke whose hands forgot their job description. And Charli—”

“I know how the clothes behave when you’re working in them,” Charli said faintly.

“Yes,” I said. “You know where they actually bind when carrying a crate, which seams take the strain when running over gravel, how it feels to be in that coat in thirty degrees. They can’t learn that from tutorials or videos.”

She put her fork down very carefully on the napkin.

“You want us to go,” she said, staring into middle space.

I wanted to say *no, I want to lock you in the linen cupboard until Queensland has learned manners*. But that wasn’t leadership. That was panic in a nice dress.

“I want you to know you have a choice,” I said instead. “Both of you. I do not pack bags and announce decisions. I lay out the reality and you tell me if it’s a yes, a no, or a not-yet.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up at my face.

“What’s the reality?” Sarah asked. “Let’s have it clean.”

“Reality is,” I said, “Someone does need to go. That’s not at question—the issue is who. I can’t go. I’m in my last semester; if I vanish for a month, I do not graduate. Mara has to stay here to finish the last pieces, oversee shipping, and put systems in place for when stock needs repair or replacement. The juniors are nowhere near ready to be thrown into a brand-new Wardrobe without supervision. They haven’t the skill set Fiona is asking for in order to train her staff.”

I looked at both of them.

“That leaves you two,” I said quietly. “You are the top of the list. For skill, for temperament, for understanding the work. If I send anyone else, I will be lying to them and to Queensland about what we can actually offer. And Wardrobe doesn’t do that.”

Sarah watched me for a long moment over the rim of her plastic container.

“Right,” she said eventually. “Here’s my position, for the record: I’m in.”

Charli’s head snapped towards her.

“Just like that?” she blurted.

Sarah shrugged.

“Oh yeah. Look, it’s what I’m good at,” she said. “I can set up a Wardrobe with my eyes half shut. I know how to talk to builders and managers and baby actors without murdering anyone. I like the idea that if our work is going to be paraded around in Queensland heat, I’m there to stop them hanging it on rusty nails.”

She speared a piece of broccoli, chewed, swallowed.

“And honestly,” she added, “the idea of watching a brand-new team find their feet with the right tools? That’s my idea of a good time.”

I hadn’t even had to ask.

Charli was still staring at her.

“You’re not… scared?” she asked.

Sarah snorted. “Of Queensland? Always. There’s Eastern browns. That’s just common sense.”

A tiny smile twitched at the corner of Charli’s mouth despite everything.

“But,” Sarah went on, gentler, “this is a job I can do with both hands tied. I’ve been in more male-coded spaces than I can count. I know the signs. I know when to escalate. And I know that if I call Celeste and say ‘pull us out’, she will have our bags on a return flight so fast the QLD director will get whiplash.”

“Correct,” I said. “That is an explicit non-negotiable. If either of you say, *this is not safe*, I pull you. No debate. No ‘are you sure’. Word for word.”

Charli’s throat moved. She looked at me at last, really looked, and I could see it click: that this was costing me as much as her, that every muscle in my body wanted to say *stay* and I was holding it open anyway.

“You’re finding this really hard,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. No point pretending otherwise. “I don’t like the idea of sleeping without you for a month. I don’t like the idea of you being in a place where I can’t get to you in under half an hour.” My jaw ached from clenching. “I hate it, actually.”

Her eyes shone.

“Then why—”

“Because you are good at this,” I cut in, softly. “Because your skills are not decorative. They are not an optional extra. You see things in the clothes the rest of them never would. You know what it takes to live in them. That is knowledge some bright, green twenty-two-year-old up there desperately needs, and she can’t get it from a PDF.”

Sarah nodded. “We can’t teach ‘what it feels like to be touched in this coat on a hot day’ over Zoom,” she said. “We can, however, take Charli up there, and have her stand next to a girl and say, ‘Listen. When the tourist puts his hand here, this is what you will feel. This is how you shift. This is what you’re allowed to say.’”

Charli winced, but she didn’t look away.

“It’s a month,” I said. “Shorter, if it’s intolerable. There will be clearly defined boundaries in the contract. Fiona is already on our side; she’s asking for help because she wants to get it right, not because she wants to wring extra labour out of you.”

I forced myself to unclench my hand on the fork, to put it down instead of snapping the plastic.

“You would have your own accommodation,” I went on. “You’re not bunking with actors. Not stuck in some mixed dorm. A small flat or two motel rooms next to each other. Daily video check-ins with me. Weekly debrief with Mara. And a clear exit clause. If at any point you say, ‘enough’, there’s no guilt, no ‘letting us down’. We reconfigure. We adapt. We are not the patriarchy; we do not demand loyalty at the expense of sanity.”

Charli’s fingers had folded into her palms so tightly the knuckles were white. She stared at the noodles in front of her as if they might rearrange into a more palatable future.

“I don’t want to leave you here, by yourself,” she said, so quietly I almost missed it under the fan.

“I don’t want you to leave,” I said. That part was easy. “But I also don’t want to clip you down to the shape of my fear.”

Her head jerked at that; I could see the word land.

“I trust Sarah to have your back,” I said. “I trust you to know your limits. And I trust myself to listen if you say ‘no more’. That’s the only way this works.”

The silence that followed wasn’t empty. It was full of calculations: trains of thought I could almost see moving behind her eyes.

“If I say no,” she said slowly, “what happens?”

“We respect it,” I said. “We tell Fiona that our people are exhausted from production, that we can offer remote support only. We tighten our documentation, write clearer guides, accept that Queensland’s learning curve will be steeper. No one dies. No one hates you. The world does not fall apart.”

Sarah nodded, backing me without missing a beat. “We’re not going to stand around saying ‘you should have gone’ for the next three years,” she said. “That’s not how we operate.”

Charli bit her lip. “And if I say yes?”

“Then you and I,” I said, “spend the next few weeks making sure you’re as prepared as possible. Practically and emotionally. We talk through worst-case scenarios and their scripts until they’re boring. We practise you saying ‘that’s not okay’ out loud without apologising afterwards. We line up small pleasures for when you come back. And then you go up there for a month, do something only you can do, and come home.”

Her eyes filled properly then, tears gathering on the lower lashes.

“I’m scared,” she admitted.

“I would be worried if you weren’t,” Sarah said dryly. “But you will not be alone. No one is throwing you into a loading bay and shutting the door.”

I reached across the table, slowly enough that she could see my hand coming, and laid it palm-up between us.

“If you decide you want to do this,” I said, “you won’t be proving anything to me. You don’t owe me a month in Queensland as some kind of loyalty tithe. You will be choosing to lend your skills to women who need them. That’s it. That’s the whole story.”

She looked at my hand. At Sarah. Back at me.

“I do want to be that person,” she whispered. “The one who can go and help and not fall apart.”

“You already are that person,” I said. “You proved it the day you said ‘could you step back a bit, please’ to that courier. This would just be the… long-distance version.”

A tear slipped over and down her cheek. She scrubbed it away with the heel of her hand, annoyed at it.

“I hate that this is so hard,” she muttered.

“Good,” Sarah said. “Means you’re not treating yourself like a piece of luggage.”

Charli made a wet, helpless sound that might have been a laugh.

“Can I… think about it?” she asked. “Like… overnight?”

“Of course,” I said, relief loosening something in my spine. “Fiona asked for an answer within the week. I told her I would not rush my people. Take tonight. Take two nights. Talk to Lauren if you want. Make a list. Colour-code it. Whatever you need.”

She nodded, once. Twice. Then put her fork back into her food with the expression of someone doing it just to keep from shaking.

Sarah reached across and nudged her shoulder with the back of her hand.

“Hey,” she said quietly. “If we go, we go as a team. I’m not dragging a shaken mouse around Queensland. I’m going with you. You’ve seen me with men who think the world is their locker room. I’m very educational.”

Charli snorted, involuntarily.

“There she is,” Sarah said, satisfied. “That’s the face I want to see when we step off the plane. The one that thinks, ‘this will be awful and also we are going to do it properly’.”

We finished lunch in a kind of thoughtful quiet. No one forced a cheer. No one pretended this was trivial. When we were done, Charli busied herself stacking containers for the bin like it was the most complicated task in the world.

As they dispersed back to their stations, I caught her for a second at the doorway.

“Charli?”

She turned, eyes already a little red.

“Whatever you decide,” I said, “I am proud of you.”

Her chin wobbled. She gave me a small, ragged nod and fled back to her machine.

---

That night, the bed felt wrong before we’d even turned the light off.

We’d gone through the motions of dinner, dishes, showers, pyjamas, like normal. We’d even watched half an episode of something forgettable. But the conversation hovered over us like humidity.

In the dark, lying on our sides facing each other, I could just make out the faint shine of her eyes.

“I think I’m going to say yes,” she whispered.

The words were soft, but they hit like a hammer and like a blessing at the same time.

“Okay,” I breathed. A desperate lump formed in my throat. “Are you sure?”

“No,” she said honestly. “But I don’t think I’m ever going to feel sure about something like this. I just… when I imagined you having to tell Fiona no, I felt small. That’s not us. And when I imagined you telling her yes, I felt… sick. But also, big. At the same time.”

“That sounds about right,” I said thickly.

“I don’t want you to be alone,” she added, voice cracking. “I hate the thought of you here without me.”

“I won’t be alone,” I said. “I’ll have Mara and Lauren and a workroom full of women and a timetable that wants me dead. And my phone. Which will be glued to my hand, by the way.”

Her hand found the front of my T-shirt and bunched the fabric up, fingers knotting there like she could anchor herself to the cotton.

“And at night?” she asked.

“At night,” I said, “I will be lying in a bed that feels too big, texting you stupid memes and waiting for you to come back and make fun of my taste in television. It will hurt. I’m not going to pretend it won’t. But it will be a hurt with an end date.”

A hot tear slid over my nose; I realised, with a small, exasperated shock, that I was crying first.

“Look at us,” I muttered, trying to laugh and failing. “Couple of teenage girls.”

Charli let out a half-sob, half-giggle.

“I’m sorry,” she said, swiping at her face. “I’m trying to be brave.”

“You are being brave,” I said. “Brave people cry all the time. You think Mara didn’t cry after she told that Melbourne manager we were walking if he didn’t fix the contract? She just did it in the toilet, like a professional.”

That got an actual, wet laugh out of her. And yes, I couldn’t imagine it, either.

We edged closer until our foreheads touched, breaths mingling in the small pocket of air between us. Her tears dampened my skin. Mine dampened hers. There was nothing glamorous about it; we sniffed and hiccuped and clung.

“I’m going to miss you so much,” she whispered into my T-shirt.

“I’m going to miss you so much I’m already annoyed with myself about it,” I said.

We didn’t talk logistics any more that night. No dates, no packing lists, no scripts. Just the raw fact of it, sitting between us like a third body in the bed.

At some point, the tears slowed. Her grip on my shirt loosened into a curl of fingers rather than a fist. My own breathing evened out against my will. We cried each other towards sleep, not in some cinematic flood, but in stuttering waves that left us both wrung-out and, eventually, too tired to keep holding ourselves upright against the inevitable.

As I drifted, the thought that had settled in my chest after the loading bay came back, reshaped.

*Resilience isn’t doing hard things without crying,* I realised drowsily. *It’s doing them, crying, and doing them anyway—because you know someone will be there on the other end.*

In a few weeks, if all went to plan, that someone would be me, waiting at an arrivals gate with a stupid sign and eyes that had forgotten how to be dry.

For now, it was just the two of us in our too-small bed, clutching damp cotton and trying to sleep around the ache of the future.

“Good,” Sarah said. “Means you’re not treating yourself like a piece of luggage.”

Charli made a wet, helpless sound that might have been a laugh.

“Can I… think about it?” she asked. “Like… overnight?”

“Of course,” I said, relief loosening something in my spine. “Fiona asked for an answer within the week. I told her I would not rush my people. Take tonight. Take two nights. Talk to your mum if you want. Make a list. Colour-code it. Whatever you need.”

She nodded, once. Twice. Then put her fork back into her food with the expression of someone doing it just to keep from shaking.

Sarah reached across and nudged her shoulder with the back of her hand.

“Hey,” she said quietly. “If we go, we go as a team. I’m not dragging a shaken mouse around Queensland. I’m going with you. You’ve seen me with men who think the world is their locker room. I’m very educational.”

Charli snorted, involuntarily.

“There she is,” Sarah said, satisfied. “That’s the face I want to see when we step off the plane. The one that thinks, ‘this will be awful and also we are going to do it properly’.”

We finished lunch in a kind of thoughtful quiet. No one forced a cheer. No one pretended this was trivial. When we were done, Charli busied herself stacking containers for the bin like it was the most complicated task in the world.

As they dispersed back to their stations, I caught her for a second at the doorway.

“Charli?”

She turned, eyes already a little red.

“Whatever you decide,” I said, “I am proud of you.”

Her chin wobbled. She gave me a small, ragged nod and fled back to her machine.

That night, the bed felt wrong before we’d even turned the light off.

We’d gone through the motions of dinner, dishes, showers, pyjamas like normal. We’d even watched half an episode of something forgettable. But the conversation hovered over us like humidity.

In the dark, lying on our sides facing each other, I could just make out the faint shine of her eyes.

“I think I’m going to say yes,” she whispered.

The words were soft, but they hit like a hammer and a blessing at the same time.

“Okay,” I breathed. A desperate lump formed in my throat. “Are you sure?”

“No,” she said honestly. “But I don’t think I’m ever going to feel sure about something like this. I just… when I imagined you having to tell Fiona no, I felt small. That’s not us. And when I imagined you telling her yes, I felt… sick. But also, big. At the same time.”

“That sounds about right,” I said thickly.

“I don’t want you to be alone,” she added, voice cracking. “I hate the thought of you here without me.”

“I won’t be alone,” I said. “I’ll have Mara and Lauren and a workroom full of women and a timetable that wants me dead. And my phone. Which will be glued to my hand, by the way.”

Her hand found the front of my T-shirt and bunched the fabric up, fingers knotting there like she could anchor herself to the cotton.

“And at night?” she asked.

“At night,” I said, “I’ll be lying in a bed that feels too big, texting you stupid memes and waiting for you to come back and make fun of my taste in television. It’ll hurt. I’m not going to pretend it won’t. But it’ll be a hurt with an end date.”

A hot tear slid over my nose; I realised, with a small, exasperated shock, that I was crying first.

“Look at us,” I muttered, trying to laugh and failing. “Couple of teenage girls.”

Charli let out a half-sob, half-giggle.

“I’m sorry,” she said, swiping at her face. “I’m trying to be brave.”

“You *are* being brave,” I said. “Brave people cry all the time. You think Mara didn’t cry after she told that Melbourne manager we were walking if he didn’t fix the contract? She just did it in the toilet, like a professional.”

That got an actual, wet laugh out of her. And yes, I couldn’t imagine it, either.

We edged closer until our foreheads touched, breaths mingling in the small pocket of air between us. Her tears dampened my skin. Mine dampened hers. There was nothing glamorous about it; we sniffed and hiccuped and clung.

“I’m going to miss you so much,” she whispered into my T-shirt.

“I’m going to miss you so much I’m already annoyed with myself about it,” I said.

We didn’t talk logistics any more that night. No dates, no packing lists, no scripts. Just the raw fact of it, sitting between us like a third body in the bed.

At some point, the tears slowed. Her grip on my shirt loosened into a curl of fingers rather than a fist. My own breathing evened out against my will. We cried each other towards sleep, not in some cinematic flood, but in stuttering waves that left us both wrung-out and, eventually, too tired to keep holding ourselves upright against the inevitable.

As I drifted, the thought that had settled in my chest after the loading bay came back, reshaped.

*Resilience isn’t doing hard things without crying,* I realised drowsily. *It’s doing them, crying, and doing them anyway—because you know someone will be there on the other end.*

In a few weeks, if all went to plan, that someone would be me, waiting at an arrivals gate with a stupid sign and eyes that had forgotten how to be dry.

For now, it was just the two of us in our too-small bed, clutching damp cotton and trying to sleep around the ache of the future.
