**A drop-in vignette (Celeste POV, past tense) — “Girl” arrives**

Inside, the apartment was dim and quiet, still holding the day’s warmth in the walls. I switched on the lamp by the kitchen and the light pooled softly on the bench—no interrogation brightness, just enough to be real.

“Sit,” I said, and put the kettle on.

Charli lowered herself onto the chair like her bones were tired of carrying her. She held her tote in her lap for a moment, then set it down carefully, as if it might break.

I filled a glass and slid it to her. Then I went to the cupboard for something plain—crackers, a banana, anything that would ask nothing of her.

The kettle began to whisper.

Charli stared at the glass and didn’t touch it.

“Hey,” I said, not sharp, just present. “Drink.”

She obeyed. A small sip. Another.

Her shoulders eased a fraction, as if her body recognised care even when her mind didn’t trust it yet.

For a while we stayed in the quiet—kettle, fridge hum, the distant sound of someone’s television through a wall. Ordinary life insisting on itself.

Then Charli spoke without looking at me.

“My mum…” Her voice caught. She swallowed. “She said she could learn.”

I nodded. “She meant it.”

Charli’s fingers worried the hem of her sleeve.

“And you…” She hesitated, almost angry at herself for asking. “You said you noticed me.”

“Yes,” I said.

She looked up then, and her eyes were bright—not drama, not performance. Just the raw edge of a day that had asked too much of her.

“I don’t know what I am,” she whispered. “I just know what I can’t be. And I—” Another swallow. “I don’t want to keep… fighting words.”

I didn’t move. I let the silence hold, the way Wardrobe held silence when someone needed space to be real.

Charli’s voice dropped even lower, like she was testing whether the air would punish her.

“But with you…” she began, then stopped, and something in her face tightened with fear. “Is it… stupid if I say it?”

My throat tightened.

“What,” I asked gently.

She stared at the tabletop as if it could absorb the shame.

“Girl,” she whispered.

The word landed between us like something fragile. Not triumphant. Not cute.

A bridge.

I let a breath out slowly, careful not to make it sound like relief at having “won” anything.

“Not stupid,” I said. “Just… brave.”

Charli blinked hard. One tear slid down her cheek and she didn’t wipe it away.

I kept my voice even, the way you do when you’re handling something that matters.

“Does that word feel right,” I asked, “when you say it here.”

Her chin dipped. A small nod.

“Okay,” I said. “Then we can use it here.”

She looked up quickly, startled by the simplicity.

“Here,” I repeated. “In this house. On days when it helps. And if you ever don’t want it, we drop it. No penalties.”

Charli’s breath hitched.

“And… outside?” she asked.

I shook my head once. “Outside is yours to decide. We don’t rush language into places where it can be used against you.”

Her shoulders lowered again, another fraction.

The kettle clicked off.

I poured the water, set the mug down, and only then—only when I was sure it wouldn’t tip her into overwhelm—I added, quiet as a promise:

“And Charli? No one who loves you gets to make that word into a weapon.”

She held the mug with both hands, like it was heat she could borrow.

For the first time all day, her face softened—not into happiness, not yet.

Into something like permission.

**Drop-in vignette (Celeste POV, past tense) — uses your exact logic**

This is written to match your tone and the arc we’ve just built (post-clinic, post-Lauren, distance thinning). Celeste reassures without declaring Charli “inevitable.”

Charli stood by the sink with the mug between her hands, as if the warmth was something she needed permission to keep.

“My mum…” she started, then stopped. Her throat moved. “She said she could learn.”

“She meant it,” I said.

Charli looked down at the tea. “She’s trying. It’s just…” Her mouth tightened. “It’s hard for her to say.”

I nodded once. I could have said a dozen things about Lauren’s blindness, about grief grooves and old pronouns, but tonight wasn’t for judging Lauren. Tonight was for keeping Charli intact.

Charli’s voice dropped. “Was it… weird for you. When Wardrobe started calling me *she*.”

The question carried something underneath it: *Did I fool you too?*

“No,” I said.

She blinked up at me.

I kept my voice level, the way you do when you’re handling something fragile and real.

“When I met you, ‘Charles’ didn’t fit,” I said. “Not because of a theory. Because of… you. The way you moved. The way you held yourself. The way you kept trying to be good in a room that was already reading you as something else.”

Charli’s hands tightened around the mug.

“So you thought—”

“I thought you were being mislabelled,” I said. “And I thought it was costing you.”

Her breath hitched.

“The room didn’t invent it,” I added, quieter. “It just… finally said out loud what I’d been noticing for a long time.”

Charli stared at me as if she didn’t trust the kindness in it.

I didn’t rush to fill the silence. I let her have the space to decide what to do with my words.

Then I said the part that mattered.

“But listen to me,” I said. “You don’t owe me a conclusion. You don’t owe anyone a speech. If there’s a word that hurts, we drop it. If there’s a word that helps, we use it—here, first—until you’re sure it’s yours.”

Her eyes went bright again.

“You really… saw me,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “From the beginning.”

And I felt my own restraint thin, not into hunger, not into possession—into something cleaner.

Care that didn’t need to stand at a distance to be safe.

**A scene fragment you can drop in (Celeste POV, past tense)**

This is the “Charli shares an unspoken desire” moment, handled exactly with your constraint: *Celeste invites truth; doesn’t define it.*

Charli’s fingers worried the edge of her sleeve. Again. Again.

“There’s something I haven’t said,” she whispered.

I didn’t move. I didn’t lean in like this was a confession I was entitled to. I kept my voice level.

“Okay,” I said. “Do you want me to listen, or do you want help finding the words.”

Charli blinked rapidly, as if even that choice was too much kindness.

“I don’t know,” she said. “It’s… dangerous.”

I nodded once. I let her hear that I believed her.

“Then we don’t take it outside,” I said. “We keep it here. No audience. No consequences. Just truth.”

Her throat bobbed. She swallowed hard.

“Mum would—”

“I know,” I said quietly. “And your friends might misunderstand. And you might not even fully understand it yourself yet.”

Charli’s eyes went wide, startled by the fact that I’d named the whole minefield without flinching.

I softened my tone—not into vagueness, into steadiness.

“But you’re allowed to want things,” I said. “You’re allowed to notice what makes you feel safe. None of that is a crime.”

Charli stared at the mug between her hands as if it was the only solid thing in the room.

“I just… I don’t want to be—” Her voice cracked. “I don’t want to be pushed into the other thing.”

“Okay,” I said. “So we don’t push. We don’t force. We don’t make declarations to satisfy anyone. We just tell the truth in small pieces, as you can carry it.”

She breathed out, shaky.

“What if the truth is…” She stopped, cheeks flushing with shame that didn’t belong to her.

I waited.

Then I said, carefully: “If there’s a word you’re afraid to say, you can try it here. Once. You can take it back. You stay in control.”

Charli’s eyes filled.

“And you won’t—”

“I won’t do anything with it,” I said. “I won’t build a story around it. I won’t use it as leverage. I won’t rush you.”

Her breath hitched.

“Okay,” she whispered, like she was stepping onto a bridge and praying it held.

I kept my gaze steady.

“You don’t have to be brave in public,” I said. “Just honest with yourself. That’s enough for tonight.”

This sets up Charli *maybe* saying “girl” next, or maybe not yet — and either is fine. The point is: **Celeste has created a space where Charli can tell the truth without it becoming a trap.**

## Scene 34 Cold
### ✨ Here ✨

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116aw.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[26-01-26]

**Scene 34 — “Here” (Celeste POV, past tense)**

Home didn’t greet us with anything dramatic.

Just the familiar quiet: the fridge hum, the faint creak in the hallway floorboard, the smell of yesterday’s laundry powder trapped in the cushions. Ordinary life, holding its shape. The kind of ordinary that can feel like mercy when your day has been a series of doors and forms and questions.

Charli kicked her shoes off carefully near the mat—as if she’d been trained to be apologetic even to a pair of sneakers—then stood there for a second too long with her tote still on her shoulder.

As if setting it down would make the day real.

I didn’t rush her.

I didn’t say *how are you*, because that question was too large and too loose. It would invite either a collapse or a lie.

I gave her something smaller. Something she could do.

“Wash your hands,” I said, and I let the instruction sound like care, not control. “Then water.”

Her shoulders eased a fraction at the familiarity of procedure.

She moved to the sink. Turned the tap. Soap. Palms, backs, fingers, nails—meticulous, the way she always was. Competence as a kind of prayer.

I filled a glass and slid it onto the counter within reach. When she finished, she took it without looking at me and drank in small, obedient sips.

Good. Hydration. Grounding. Proof she was still inside her body.

I put the kettle on. Not tea as a symbol, not tea as a hug—tea as heat, routine, and an excuse for silence to be allowed.

While the water warmed, Charli sat at the kitchen table and placed the folded papers from the appointment neatly beside her tote. She stared at them as if they might change shape if she blinked wrong.

I didn’t comment on the papers. I didn’t ask what the doctor said.

I made toast.

Two slices, plain. Butter, no drama. The smell rose quietly, and the kitchen began to feel less like a place where something had almost gone wrong, and more like a place where something could be made right.

When I set the plate down, she flinched—tiny, automatic—as if she expected the gesture to come with a price.

“Eat,” I said simply.

She obeyed. Took one bite. Chewed too carefully.

I waited. Let the kettle hiss and the toast do its slow work.

After a minute, she spoke without lifting her eyes.

“My mum said ‘Don’t,’” she whispered.

I didn’t pretend to misunderstand.

“In the car,” she added, voice thin. “When I said I was scared about… the future.”

I nodded once, giving her the dignity of being believed.

Charli swallowed hard. Her hands tightened around the edge of the plate.

“I know she didn’t mean it like…” She shook her head, frustrated. “She wasn’t trying to be cruel.”

No. Lauren wasn’t cruel.

Lauren was terrified. And organised. And afraid of anything that sounded like a cliff edge.

“She meant ‘don’t borrow pain that hasn’t happened yet,’” I said quietly.

Charli’s breath hitched, like the sentence gave her a rung to stand on.

“But it still…” Her voice cracked. “It still made me stop talking.”

I felt my throat tighten.

“Yeah,” I said. “Because ‘don’t’ can sound like *shut up*, even when it’s meant as protection.”

Charli stared at the toast. Her eyes were bright again, unperformed.

She blinked fast, and for once she didn’t apologise for it.

The kettle clicked off.

I poured the water, set a mug down in front of her, then sat opposite her—close enough to be present, far enough to not crowd her.

I didn’t reach across the table. I didn’t touch her hand.

I held the space.

Charli swallowed again. “I don’t want to upset her.”

“You don’t have to manage your mother’s feelings by disappearing,” I said. Not sharp. Just true.

Her eyes flicked up to mine, startled—as if the concept had never been presented so plainly.

I softened my voice. “She’s allowed to have feelings. You’re allowed to exist anyway.”

Charli’s mouth trembled. She looked down quickly.

The silence stretched. Not empty. Working.

Then she said, so quietly it almost didn’t carry:

“I think… there’s something else.”

I didn’t move.

“Okay,” I said. “Do you want me to listen, or do you want help finding words.”

She blinked rapidly. The question itself seemed to steady her—permission, choice, control.

“Help,” she whispered.

I nodded. “All right.”

Charli’s fingers worried the corner of a napkin. Again. Again.

“It’s… dangerous,” she said.

I let that land. I didn’t dismiss it. I didn’t minimise it into *you’re safe here* like a slogan.

Instead, I did what Wardrobe had taught me: I built the container.

“Then we keep it in the safest place first,” I said. “Here. This table. This room. No audience. No consequences. No decisions you can’t undo.”

Her shoulders lowered a fraction.

“You’re not going to tell my mum,” she said, and the fear behind the sentence was almost childlike.

“I’m not going to take your words and weaponise them,” I said. “I won’t do anything with them without you.”

Charli’s eyes went wider, like that was a new kind of safety she hadn’t expected anyone to offer.

I continued, calm and careful. “If you tell me something tonight, it stays *yours*. I can help you hold it, but I don’t get to own it.”

She swallowed. “Okay.”

I watched her breathing. Slow. Shaky, but present.

“Try it in pieces,” I said. “Start with what you know.”

Charli stared at the mug. Her voice came out rough.

“I know I don’t want to be called ‘sir’.”

I nodded. “Good. That’s true.”

“And I don’t want…” She winced as if the next word could bite her. “I don’t want ‘son.’”

The word made the air feel heavier.

I didn’t flinch.

“Okay,” I said again. “So we drop those words.”

Charli’s breath left her in a trembling exhale.

“And…” She stopped.

I waited.

“And there’s a word that…” Her eyes squeezed shut for a second, as if she was bracing for impact. “There’s a word that feels… like it might fit.”

My heart thudded once, hard. I kept my face neutral, because this couldn’t be about my anticipation. It had to be about her courage.

“What’s the word,” I asked, gentle.

She didn’t answer immediately.

She stared at the tabletop so intensely I thought she might be trying to burn a hole through it.

Then, in a whisper that barely counted as sound, she said:

“Girl.”

It landed like something fragile and bright.

Not a performance. Not a victory.

A test. A reach.

For a second her eyes flicked up to mine—quick, terrified—then away again, as if she couldn’t bear to see my reaction.

I let a breath out slowly, careful not to make it a sigh of relief, careful not to turn this into *I knew it*.

“Not stupid,” I said. “And not dangerous in here.”

Charli’s throat bobbed. She swallowed hard.

I kept my voice steady. “How does it feel when you say it.”

She shook her head once, almost angry at herself. “I don’t know.”

“Try again,” I said softly. “Only if you want.”

She hesitated.

Then she whispered, a little clearer this time, like she was learning how to let the word take up space:

“Girl.”

Her shoulders dropped a fraction. A tiny release.

Not happiness. Relief.

Her eyes flooded, and this time a tear slid down and she didn’t move to stop it. She just let it happen, as if she was too tired to police herself.

I didn’t tell her not to cry.

I didn’t reach across the table to wipe the tear either.

I let the tear be what it was: evidence that her body had found a truth it could breathe around.

“You don’t have to commit to anything tonight,” I said. “Saying a word isn’t signing a contract.”

Charli’s laugh broke into something that wasn’t quite a laugh—more like a cracked sound of disbelief.

“But… if I say it,” she whispered, “then it’s real.”

I chose my next words carefully, because this was the hinge.

“It’s real that the word gives you relief,” I said. “That matters. Relief is information. It’s not the whole story, but it’s not nothing.”

She stared at the table, trembling.

“What if my mum—”

“We don’t take this word into places where it can be used against you,” I said. “Not yet. And not unless you choose.”

Charli’s eyes flicked to mine again. Searching.

“You really mean that,” she said.

“Yes.”

A beat.

Then she whispered, “I think… I want it.”

The sentence was so quiet it would have been easy to miss.

I didn’t let myself smile. Not because I wasn’t moved—because I was. But because a smile here could feel like approval, like reward, like Celeste getting what she wanted.

This wasn’t about me winning a prediction.

This was about her surviving herself.

So I gave her the cleanest version of support I had.

“Okay,” I said. “Then you’re allowed to want it.”

Her breath hitched.

“And you’re allowed to be scared of wanting it,” I added. “Both can be true.”

Charli covered her mouth with her hand like she was trying to hold herself in. Tears slipped down and she made no sound.

I watched her hands—small, careful hands that had sorted pins and mended seams and tried to stitch herself into acceptability—and something in my ribs tightened painfully.

I wanted to cross the table. I wanted to pull her into my arms and wrap her up and make everything simple.

I didn’t.

Not yet.

Because wanting to comfort her and *needing* to comfort her were not the same thing—and I refused to teach her that she had to fall apart to earn softness.

Instead, I did what I could do safely: I anchored her.

“Tell me what you’re afraid will happen,” I said quietly.

Charli’s voice came out muffled behind her hand.

“That if I say it out loud,” she whispered, “I’ll lose everyone.”

I nodded, slow. “That’s a real fear.”

She lowered her hand, eyes wet. “And if I don’t say it, I’ll lose…” She faltered. “Me.”

The sentence hit like a bell. Clear. Final.

I felt my eyes burn. I kept my voice even.

“Okay,” I said. “Then tonight, you don’t lose you.”

Charli stared at me, stunned by the simplicity.

I continued, calm as structure. “We keep it here. We practise saying it in safety. We let the professionals help you work out what it means and what you want. And we don’t let anyone rush you into public declarations you’re not ready for.”

She blinked, and something in her face softened.

“You’re not… disappointed,” she whispered.

“No,” I said. “I’m relieved you told someone the truth before it turned into another secret.”

Her lower lip trembled.

“And,” I added, because it mattered, “I’m proud of you for being brave in the only place bravery actually counts—inside yourself.”

Charli’s eyes closed briefly, like she couldn’t stand the tenderness of that sentence.

When she opened them again, she looked smaller. Not diminished.

Just unarmoured.

“Can I…” she began, then stopped.

I didn’t interrupt. I waited.

She whispered, “Can I say it again.”

My throat tightened.

“Yes,” I said. “If you want.”

She took a shaky breath, then let the word come out like a candle flame in a dark room.

“Girl.”

I nodded once, solemn as a vow.

“Okay,” I said. “Girl.”

She stared at me as if the echo of the word might be too much generosity to accept.

Then she exhaled, long and trembling, and her shoulders settled like something heavy had finally been set down.

The room went quiet again.

Not empty.

Intentional.

Waiting.

I stood, moved to the sink, rinsed the knife, wiped the bench—small domestic motions that said *we are still in life; life continues; you are not alone in it.*

When I turned back, Charli was watching me with eyes still wet, but steadier.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

I nodded once. “Drink your tea.”

She obeyed.

And the obedience this time didn’t look like fear.

It looked like trust.

## Scene 34 Warm
### ✨ Here ✨

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ax.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[26-01-26]

**Scene 34 — “Here” (Celeste POV, past tense) — warmer revision 🌸**

Home met us the way it always did: quietly.

The hallway smelled faintly of detergent and warm timber. The living room lamp cast a soft pool of light that didn’t demand anything of you. Even the fridge hum felt like background reassurance—*life is still normal, you’re still in it.*

Charli took her shoes off at the door, careful, as if she didn’t quite trust herself not to make a mess of the floor. She still had her tote on her shoulder. She stood there with it, not moving, like the day might collapse if she set it down.

I didn’t say anything for a second.

Then I stepped beside her—not in front, not behind—and kept my voice low.

“You’re home,” I said. “You did the hard part.”

Her breath left her in a small tremor.

I nodded toward the kitchen. “Come on. Tea. Water. Something in your stomach.”

She followed. Not because I was commanding her—because she knew I meant it. Because the bus ride home had already taught her that my steadiness wasn’t a trap.

At the sink she washed her hands the way she always did: meticulous, thorough, almost ritual. I watched without comment, because that kind of care was one of the ways she kept herself intact.

I filled a glass and set it down.

“Drink,” I said, gently. “Just a few sips.”

She did. Small sips, obedient at first—then a longer one, like her body remembered it had permission to be looked after.

“Good,” I murmured.

I put the kettle on.

The click and hiss of it felt like a signal to the room: *we’re not in the clinic anymore. We’re not in the car anymore. We’re in a place where you don’t have to be brave in public.*

Charli sat at the table. She took the folded paper from the appointment and placed it beside her tote as neatly as if tidiness could keep it from being frightening.

I set toast down in front of her—plain, buttered, unambitious.

Her eyes flicked to it, then to me. A question without words: *Is it okay to need this?*

“It’s okay,” I said, answering it. “Eat what you can.”

She took a bite. Chewed carefully. Swallowed like it cost her something.

I sat opposite her. Not across like a judge. Across like someone who intended to stay.

The kettle whispered.

For a while we let silence do what silence can do when it’s safe: soften the edges.

Then Charli spoke, staring into her tea mug like it might hold an answer.

“My mum said ‘Don’t,’” she whispered.

I felt my chest tighten—not anger, not judgement. Understanding.

“In the car,” she added. “When I started talking about the… future.”

I nodded once.

“She didn’t mean it like…” Charli’s voice cracked. “She wasn’t trying to be cruel.”

“No,” I said gently. “She wasn’t.”

Charli’s fingers pinched the edge of her sleeve.

“It still made me stop,” she admitted, shame creeping into it. Like stopping was a failure.

I leaned forward slightly, careful not to crowd her.

“Yeah,” I said softly. “Because ‘don’t’ can sound like *shut up* when you’re already scared.”

Charli looked up at me fast, eyes bright.

I didn’t flinch away from it.

“I think she meant,” I added, “don’t borrow pain that hasn’t happened. But she said it with fear in her mouth.”

Charli swallowed. “It felt like… I wasn’t allowed to say the scary thing.”

“You are allowed,” I said, and my voice warmed around the sentence. “You’re allowed to say it here.”

Her breath hitched.

“Here,” I repeated, not as a slogan, as a promise. “This house doesn’t punish honesty.”

Charli’s shoulders lowered a fraction. The tiniest exhale.

The kettle clicked off. I poured the water, set the mug closer to her hands, and waited until she wrapped her fingers around it. Heat. Proof.

She stared at the mug for a long moment, then said, quietly:

“There’s something I haven’t said.”

I didn’t move. I didn’t lean in like I owned the confession.

“Okay,” I said. “Do you want me to just listen, or do you want help finding words.”

She blinked rapidly, the kindness of that choice almost too much.

“Help,” she whispered.

“All right,” I said.

She stared at the table.

“It’s… dangerous,” she said.

I let that stand. I didn’t rush to contradict it.

Then I said, very calmly: “Then we treat it carefully.”

Charli’s eyes flicked to mine.

“We keep it small,” I continued. “We keep it private. You don’t have to take it outside. You don’t have to take it to your mum. You don’t have to take it anywhere you don’t feel safe.”

She swallowed hard.

“And you won’t—” she began.

“I won’t do anything with your words,” I said gently. “I won’t build a story around them. I won’t make you into a project. You tell me what you can. I’ll hold it with you.”

Her throat bobbed. “Okay.”

I nodded. “Start with what you know.”

Charli’s voice came out rough.

“I know I don’t want ‘sir.’”

“Okay,” I said, steady. “That’s true.”

“And I don’t want…” She flinched. “I don’t want ‘son.’”

The word made her look smaller, as if it pressed her down.

I kept my tone soft. “Then we don’t use those words.”

Her breath shuddered out.

A pause. Then:

“There’s a word that…” She stopped, cheeks warming with shame that didn’t belong to her. “There’s a word that feels… like it might fit.”

My heart thudded once, hard. I kept my face neutral—not because I wasn’t moved, but because this couldn’t turn into my reaction.

“What word,” I asked, gentle.

Charli stared at the tabletop like it might swallow her.

Then, so softly it was almost air:

“Girl.”

The word landed between us like something breakable.

Charli glanced up at me—quick, terrified—and then looked away, braced for me to make it too much.

I didn’t.

I let my voice warm instead.

“Okay,” I said.

Her head jerked slightly, surprised.

I softened further. “How does it feel when you say it.”

She swallowed. “I don’t know.”

“That’s okay,” I said. “You don’t have to know what it *means* yet. Just what it does to you.”

Her eyes shone.

“Does it hurt,” I asked, quietly, “or does it help.”

Charli’s breath caught.

“It helps,” she whispered, and the admission looked like it cost her months.

I nodded once. “Then it’s worth listening to.”

A tear slid down her cheek. She didn’t wipe it away.

Something in my chest pulled hard.

I hesitated—then asked, softly, like a courtesy and a vow in one:

“May I come closer.”

Charli blinked at me. Then nodded, tiny.

I stood and moved around the table slowly, as if speed might frighten her. I didn’t touch her right away. I just sat beside her—close enough that she could feel I was there.

Charli’s hands trembled around the mug.

“You’re not in trouble,” I murmured. “Not with me.”

Her breath hitched again. She stared at her tea as if it might spill.

“You’re allowed,” I said, gentle as silk, “to say the word that helps.”

Charli’s lips trembled. Then she whispered again, barely audible:

“Girl.”

I didn’t echo it back like a stamp.

I answered it like an ally.

“Okay,” I said softly. “Okay.”

She let out a sound that was almost a sob, and her shoulders shook once.

I didn’t pull her in. I didn’t claim her.

I offered one hand on the table between us, palm up.

“If you want,” I said, “you can take my hand. If you don’t, that’s fine too.”

Charli looked at my hand like it was something sacred and frightening.

Then she placed her fingers into my palm.

Warm. Light. Real.

I closed my hand around hers—not tight, just enough to say *I’ve got you*—and kept my voice low.

“Tonight,” I said, “you don’t have to be brave in public. You can just be honest in here.”

Charli’s tears slid silently. She didn’t apologise for them.

“I’m scared,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said.

“And I don’t want to lose everyone.”

“You won’t lose me,” I said, immediate and simple. Then, softer: “And we’re not going to rush your words into places where they can be used against you. We do this step by step. Like the doctor said.”

Charli’s grip tightened slightly on my fingers.

After a moment she whispered, “Can I say it again.”

My throat tightened.

“Yes,” I said. “If you want.”

She breathed in, shaky, then let the word out like a small lantern in a dark room:

“Girl.”

I nodded once, solemn with respect.

“Okay,” I said. “Okay.”

She exhaled, long and trembling, and something in her shoulders settled—as if a weight she’d been holding alone had finally found another set of hands.

I stayed beside her. No speeches. No promises I couldn’t keep. Just presence.

After a minute I reached for the butter knife and the plate—quiet domestic tidying, the way you keep a room from turning into a shrine to fear.

“More toast?” I asked softly.

Charli shook her head. Then, after a beat, surprised herself.

“Maybe… later.”

“Whenever you want,” I said.

She sipped her tea.

And the sip this time wasn’t obedience.

It was trust.
