Scene 27
✨ Stop Tiptoeing ✨
[Sarah]

Wardrobe has two moods: *working* and *waiting*.

Working is steam and noise and the room moving like a body that knows its own muscles—irons hissing, scissors biting, chalk tapping, someone calling for tape, someone else answering without looking up. Waiting is the same space, but hushed, as if the tables are holding their breath, as if the garments themselves are listening for their names.

Today it’s working.

The kettle clicks, someone swears at a stubborn bobbin, and Mara’s shears make that confident little *snick* that sounds like authority in metal form.

Charlie is already here.

Of course he is.

He turns up early the way anxious people do when they’ve learned that being first is safer than being seen arriving. Bag on the same hook. Hands washed thoroughly: palms, backs, between fingers, nails, as if cleanliness is a kind of apology he can offer the world in advance. He’s at the long table smoothing linen like it’s a nervous animal. He looks up when I come in, and his face does that automatic thing: polite, tentative, ready to make himself smaller if required.

The opposite of blokey. Blokes *enter*. They land in a room as if space was made for them by law. They take up oxygen and call it personality.

Charlie doesn’t take up anything. He asks the air for permission.

Lucy is in too, coffee in hand, unimpressed with the universe as usual. Tahlia follows, one earbud in, humming without meaning to, already tugging tape measures into submission. Mara says nothing to anyone, which is the closest she gets to a welcoming speech.

A couple of the Faire girls are due later for adjustments: hem lifts, sleeve easing, last-minute panic. The whole production is a tide pool of women at this point: skirts lifted, hair pinned, laughter breaking through steam like sunlight.

And Charlie is... in the middle of it, even when he’s not trying to be.

That’s the thing. It started before anyone changed a single word.

It started with how he behaves.

He doesn’t stare or crowd. He doesn’t do that typical male thing of testing boundaries by “accidentally” leaning too close and pretending it wasn’t on purpose. He asks before he touches fabric that isn’t his. He steps back when a woman shifts her weight. He reads the room like someone who’s spent his whole life learning that women’s comfort is a language, and he’s familiar with the dictionary.

He’s useful, too: quietly so, which is rarer than gold.

There’s a gown on the mannequin today, one of Mara’s prototypes. A beautiful beast of a thing: fitted bodice, clever seam placements, pins placed like punctuation. Charlie is meant to wear-test it briefly later, just movement checks. Stress points. Nothing dramatic.

He’s already flagged one weak point without being asked.

“Underarm seam,” he says softly, indicating the area with two fingers hovering, not touching. “If she reaches... it’ll pull.”

Lucy squints at it. “You’re sure?”

Charlie nods. “It’s... it’s already talking.”

Tahlia laughs. “Fabric doesn’t talk.”

Charlie’s mouth twitches, embarrassed. “Okay, not literally.”

Lucy, who has the emotional warmth of a refrigerator and the moral clarity of a knife, says, “It does if you’ve got eyes. Good catch.”

Charlie goes pink in the face, as if praise is a garment he doesn’t know how to wear.

That’s when I notice something I’ve noticed more and more lately:

The girls *like* him.

Not in a romantic way or a “he’s cute” way, but in the way women like a safe man in a women’s room: with relief. His humour is easy, not confronting. They like him with a kind of affection that isn’t flirtation, it’s fellowship.

He is, without trying to be, *not a threat*. Which is, in our world, a blooming miracle.

A Faire girl arrives early—Bree, I think her name is. Tall, strong shoulders, the sort who fills a doorway without making noise. She’s wearing leggings and a hoodie now, but I’ve seen her in full kit: stomacher pinned, skirt swinging, face lit like she was born to be looked at and never flinch. She waves her phone.

“Can someone save me? My sleeve is trying to strangle me.”

Mara doesn’t look up. “Tahlia.”

Tahlia gestures her over, but Bree’s eyes flick to Charlie.

“Oh,” she says, bright. “You’re him. The one who does the stress testing.”

Charlie stiffens at “him,” not offended: just... aware.

Tahlia answers first, distracted. “Yeah. He’s weirdly good.”

Lucy adds, deadpan, “He’s brutal.”

Charlie flinches, then realises Lucy means it as praise. His shoulders loosen a fraction.

Bree grins. “Love that for you, mate. Could you look at my sleeve seam? It’s doing a thing.”

Charlie looks momentarily alarmed, like she’s offered him a live snake, but he nods. He steps in carefully, hands hovering until Bree shifts her weight and says, “Go on then. Pin me.”

And he does, clinical as a nurse, gentle as a seamstress, eyes focused on the fabric and not her body in the way men’s eyes so often are. Bree watches his face in the mirror with theatrical curiosity.

“You’re not at all nervous, are you?”

Charlie hesitates. “A little.”

“Well, you’re not acting at *all* nervous,” she remarks.

Lucy snorts. “He’s always nervous. He just doesn’t make it our problem.”

And Bree says something then—light, offhand, not loaded—that tilts the day by a millimetre.

“That’s very "girl" of you,” she says with a friendly smile, looking up from Charlie’s careful hands to stare into his eyes. “Not making it our problem.”

Charlie’s looks back, his lip twitching. There’s a second where his face does that old reflex: *Do I correct? Don’t let them misunderstand.* Like misunderstanding is dangerous.

But he doesn’t say anything. He swallows, and give her a weak smile. His eyes drop back to the seam.

Bree doesn’t push. Theatre women are good at reading the moment and not punching through it. She just hums and lets him work. When she leaves, sleeve saved, she tosses over her shoulder,

“Tell your girls you’re a wizard.” 

Lucy calls back, “He’s not a wizard, he’s a nervous Nellie!”

Tahlia laughs, and Charlie—Charlie laughs too. Quietly, almost like it escaped. It is such a small sound, and it changes the air.

By midday the Faire girls have started drifting through in twos and threes, and Wardrobe feels less like a workplace and more like a women’s camp: fabrics on every surface, hair pins shared, snacks appearing without anyone admitting they brought them, bodies moving around each other without apology.

Charlie is included in the small things first.

Tahlia offers him a hair tie when his fringe keeps falling into his eyes. Lucy slides a spare thimble across the table when his fingers are raw from hand-stitching. Someone pushes lip balm toward him with a muttered, “You look dry,” as if that’s a crime.

He accepts it all very politely... too politely. Like a starving person taking bread and trying not to look hungry. He still apologises too much. Still asks permission for space that’s already been given. But he’s less rigid, less braced.

He speaks a fraction more.

He joins the conversation sometimes, tentative at first—an observational comment, a small joke—then with slightly more ease when he realises no one is going to punish him for having a voice.

It’s in the middle of this easy chatter that the language begins to shift.

Not with a trumpet or a meeting, but with girls being girls, and saying what they mean.

Tahlia is telling a story about a client who called stays “a corset thingy,” and Mara’s eyes nearly set fire to the table. Lucy is relaying it with her usual scorn—“They think understructure is optional because they’ve never had to hold anything up”—and one of the Faire girls, a petite brunette with a laugh like broken glass, points at Charlie and says:

“He gets it, though. Look at him. He’s got the patience of a woman.”

Charlie startles. Again—again—his face rises into correction, then stops.

Because what would he even say?

*No, I don’t?* while his hands are literally doing the care-work of a seam? Lucy, without looking up, says,

“He’s got the *fear* of a woman. That’s why. He knows if he screws it up, Mara will kill him.”

Mara doesn’t blink. “Correct.”

Everyone laughs.

Charlie laughs too, but his laugh is smaller. Not because he’s fragile, because he’s listening. Because he’s taking in something he’s never had before: women laughing *with* him, not *at* him, and no one sharpening a sexual edge into it.

And then—almost invisibly—someone says it. Not about him. Not to him.

Just... in the air.

Bree returns with another girl, and she says, “She’s the one who fixed my sleeve,” gesturing in Charlie’s direction, and then she keeps walking as if the word is nothing. As if it’s already true.

I freeze in the tiniest way. Not shocked or scandalised: just registering the move.

Lucy’s head lifts. Tahlia’s eyes flick to Charlie, quick as a pulse check. Charlie goes still.

And for a beat, I think he’ll correct it... he’ll panic, he’ll retreat into “no, no, that’s not—” because that’s what he’s trained to do. Keep everyone comfortable by making himself smaller.

But he doesn’t.

He takes a breath. His fingers tighten around the linen, then ease.

And he says nothing.

The moment passes, not awkwardly, but smoothly, because women are experts at letting a door open without slamming it.

Tahlia, bless her, doesn’t make it a Big Thing. She doesn’t ask a question like it’s a quiz. She just accepts the shape of the room.

“She did fix it,” Tahlia says lightly, as if she’s confirming the weather. “She spotted the weak point before anyone else.”

Lucy huffs, as if irritated by the whole universe. “She’s annoyingly observant.”

Charlie looks up, eyes wide. He’s watching them the way you watch someone handling a fragile object—terrified they’ll drop it. Tahlia, with a gentle smile to dilute the impact, meets his gaze briefly, just long enough for him to understand something:

We’re not dropping this. We're not dropping *you*.

And then she turns away and keeps working, because that’s how you make kindness stick: you don't make it a big thing. You treat it like it’s normal.

Later, when a delivery bloke knocks at the side door, the room tightens by habit. Different knock. Man’s knock. The kind that assumes the world will part.

He comes in smelling of diesel and entitlement, clipboard under his arm, eyes scanning the room like he’s shopping. He glances at Charlie—at Charlie’s smallness, his quietness, his softness—and his expression does that unpleasant male calculus. Categorising. Deciding.

He points his pen vaguely. “Where d’you want this, mate? He—”

He doesn’t get to finish.

“She wants it left by the back wall,” I say, bright as a bell. “And you’ll mind your hands. Those boxes aren’t the only thing fragile in here.”

The bloke blinks, recalibrates. He mutters something that could be an apology if he weren’t allergic to the concept, and he shifts the boxes where I indicate, suddenly very interested in being helpful.

The door closes behind him.

The room exhales.

Charlie hasn’t moved, but something in him has. His shoulders loosen. The line of his jaw softens. Like someone’s removed a weight he didn’t realise he was carrying. Lucy takes a sip of coffee and says, matter-of-fact: 

“Good.”

Tahlia, without looking up, adds, “We can stop tiptoeing now.”

And I—because I’m me, and because naming things is half my job in this building—lean against the table and say, “About time.”

Charlie’s eyes flick to me. Cautious.

“Are you—” he starts, then stops, because he doesn’t know what he’s allowed to ask for.

I keep it easy. Teasing, but not sharp. A door offered as air.

“If it doesn’t feel right,” I say, “you can tell us. We’re not savages.”

Lucy snorts. “Speak for yourself.”

Charlie swallows. He looks at the women around him: Lucy’s brutal competence, Tahlia’s effortless camaraderie, the Faire girls’ theatrical warmth. He looks at me, and I know what he’s seeing: someone who will cut a man down for overstepping without turning it into a melodrama.

He says, very softly, “I... don’t mind.”

Not “I want.” Not “I demand.” Not “This is my identity.”

Just: *I don’t mind.*

It is the most Charlie thing in the world: making relief sound like it’s no trouble. Lucy watchesCharlie for a beat, then says, flat and final,

“Good. I’m not doing mental gymnastics every time I talk about you, love.”

Tahlia smiles. “She’s literally here. She’s literally doing the work.”

One of the Faire girls, the brunette with the glass-laugh, grins and says, “She’s one of us, then.”

She goes pink in the face. And I see it: the way the word lands, as a hand on the shoulder. A tag of belonging.

From then on, it spreads. Not because anyone enforces it, but bBecause it’s easier. It fits. And because women like language that keeps the room safe.

“She needs the smaller pins.”
“Tell her I’ve got the tape.”
“She found the weak point again.”

Charli starts moving differently. Not instantly or like she's pulled on a costume, but like someone who’s stopped bracing for a blow. She joins us for lunch without hovering at the edges. She laughs a little more, a little easier. She smiles more. She even responds with opinions if asked: small ones at first, then slightly more when she realises no one is going to punish her for being present.

And all instinct to correct us entirely disappears.

As if correcting would risk the gift. Our gift.

As if “she” is a warm coat she’s afraid might be taken back if she denies liking it.

One afternoon, near the end of shift, I catch a look on her face that doesn’t match the room. Everyone else is buzzing: Faire girls chattering about tomorrow’s rehearsal, Lucy complaining about pockets, Tahlia humming while she cleans her machine. The air is light.

Charli is light too—until she turns her head toward the window and the overhead lamp catches her profile.

There’s a flicker. A shadow, brief as a stitch snag.

A secret sorrow.

It’s in her eyes, and it makes no sense with the laughter around her. The sort of sadness you see when someone has something precious in their hands and suddenly remembers the world is full of thieves.

Lucy sees it too. Lucy sees everything, she just doesn’t always bother to comment.

“You all right, love?”

The word love isn’t Lucy’s usual. Which means she means it.

Charli blinks, startled, and the sorrow snaps back behind her face like a curtain drawn.

“Yeah,” she says quickly. “I’m fine.”

She is not fine. But she is safe enough now to pretend she is, and that, frankly, is its own kind of progress.

Tahlia bumps her shoulder lightly as she passes. “Come tomorrow,” she says. “We’re getting chips. You’re not allowed to say no. You’ll just make it weird.”

The Faire girls chorus agreement. Bree points a finger at Charli like she’s casting a spell.

“She’s coming,” Bree declares. “She’s ours.”

Charli’s breath catches.

And there it is, plain as anything:

Not *he*, performing near women.

But *she*, held by women.

She looks down at her hands for a moment—at the little pinpricks, the chalk smudges, the evidence of belonging. Then she lifts her eyes back to the room, and her smile is small but unmistakably real.

“I’ll come,” she says.

Mara taps the table once, impatient with sentiment.

“Enough talking,” she says. “More work.”

And that’s Wardrobe, isn’t it? Just women doing the quiet, effective thing.

Turning “she” from a word into a place.
