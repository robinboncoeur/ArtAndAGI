✨ Forsaken Studies ✨

[Celeste POV]

I sat curled up in the window seat that doubled as storage, staring unseeing out at the autumn leaves, the wind blowing empty branches about, sipping my morning flat white. Charli made the best flat-whites: they had splurged on a used expresso coffee maker. It was built in Italy, over ten years old but still looked brand-new.

And it produced brilliant expressos. And flat-whites. And, Charli's favourite, mochas.

Charli was in the laundry, which also served as pantry, putting a load of washing on. She wasn't meant to be out and about as this was my study period, but almost all those rules seemed irrelevant, now.

The rules had been designed to protect me. Protect Charli too, of course, but when they were written, it was for a lad moving in with a young woman. And designed for a conventional sort of lad, one requiring strict guidelines, with consequences.

Not I or Mara or even Lauren truly knew this person, Charli.

I had another sip and stared malevolently at my textbook. I could sense my studies frowned back, feeling slighted. I just wasn't in a headspace for statistics and gantt charts.

All I could think of was--magic. The pure, simple, fiery enchantment of a touch: Charli's touch.

That first time I touched her hand... in the loos. I think I must have introduced myself... I can't remember. What I do remember was how light, almost subtanceless her hand felt in mine, long before I knew of 'she'.

If I had known then, would I--

My breath caught, suddenly aware of the emotion cliff's edge I was strolling carelessly along.

Charli emerged from the laundry carrying the clothes backet with wet clothes. Her face brightened into a quick, bewitching smile before she disappeared into the room that had been her bedroom, but was now ostensibly the study.

I'm pretty sure she'd seen through my ruse. And when I told her... that melt, that doe-eyed delight that she couldn't get up the courage to express.

I had another sip: it was cooling too fast. And I like savouring, not greedy guzzling. With pretty much everything--shopping for clothes, exploring a new restaurant, trying for a new look with a more expensive eyeshadow--but when it came to Charli, my hunger for her had grown like a nettle in a part of the garden you avoid because of nettles. 

I didn't recognise myself.

I felt slightly dizzy, and everything around me stop when I remembered that first kiss.

Charli was humming to herself... some Russian melody she'd become enchanted by.

I was enchanted by... her.

The kiss... yes, it was ever so sweet. But it was her, so melting, so yielding, so... feminine. I swallowed, my vision going tunnel, just at the thought. Yes, that was it: it was her yielding to me as much as her touch that I found completely irresistible.

[26-01-23]

**Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.

**Scene — “Ships in the Night” (Sarah POV, 1st person, past tense)**

By the time we got back from the lawyer’s office, the afternoon light had gone that thin, metallic colour that made everything in the street look slightly unreal.

Lauren unlocked the front door like it was an exam she’d revised for. Key in, turn, shoulder to the wood. No hesitation. A few weeks earlier she would have paused, braced, checked the street twice for threats only she could see. Today she just opened the door and walked in, back straight, bag on her shoulder.

I followed with the folder of documents under my arm, feeling oddly surplus to requirements. The lawyer had been competent and dry; there were timelines now, forms, a clear process for untangling the house from Roger. The spectre of “you might see him again” had been named and pinned to a calendar instead of floating in every hallway.

Lauren kicked her shoes off and headed for the kitchen.

“Tea?” she called over her shoulder.

“Please,” I said. My voice sounded normal, which felt like a small miracle.

I dropped the folder on the dining table and stood there for a second with my hands on the back of one chair, listening to the familiar sounds: kettle filled, mug cupboard opened, her small, irritated noise when one handle caught on another. The domestic soundtrack of a life that had been frayed and was slowly knitting back together.

I should have felt proud. I did, partly. She’d sat in that lawyer’s office and asked sensible questions about titles and settlements and what happened if he tried to drag things out. Her fingers had only trembled once, when she signed the first form. Even then, she’d steadied herself with one deep breath and a small, private shake of her shoulders, like a swimmer before a cold pool.

The thing I hadn’t expected was the aftertaste of it.

We were, technically, moving forward. Paperwork. Plans. The kind of structure my brain usually loved.

Instead, I felt like someone had quietly removed one of the load-bearing walls inside me and told me to pretend I didn’t notice.

Lauren came back in with two mugs and set one in front of me. She’d tied her hair up before we left; a strand had come loose and was curling damply against her temple. There was a tiny ink smudge on her thumb from signing so many times. I had the sudden, irrational urge to grab her hand and lick it off, just to prove she was here, ink and all.

She sat opposite me and wrapped both hands around her mug.

“So,” she said briskly. “We have a plan.”

“We do,” I said.

“In a few weeks, they lodge the thing,” she went on. “He gets notified, he sulks, he maybe makes noises, but legally, he can’t do much except drag his feet. In six months—give or take—I am no longer tied to him by brick and mortar.”

“Yes,” I said again.

She looked at me over the rim of her mug.

“You don’t have to keep saying yes,” she said. “You’re allowed to use other words. You’re the chatty one, remember.”

Normally, that would have earned her a smirk. Today it just made my throat tighten.

“I’m thinking,” I said.

“Dangerous,” she deadpanned, then softened. “What about?”

You. Leaving. Me leaving. Both of us moving away from lives where “alone” was standard.

“The timing of everything,” I said, which was true without being the whole truth. “Queensland. The house. You seeing him again. Me not being here when that happens.”

There it was, half out in the open.

She stiffened almost imperceptibly.

“Ah,” she said. “That.”

We hadn’t talked about Queensland since Celeste’s Thai-and-triage lunch. I’d told Celeste I was in before the question had fully left her mouth. It had been the easiest call I’d made all week. Of course I was going. Outerwear, fittings, teaching baby costumers how not to melt garments on contact—that was my terrain.

The hard part had been walking home afterwards with the knowledge that for a month, Lauren’s bed would be missing one chronically organised, emotionally constipated lesbian.

She took a sip of tea that was probably too hot, judging by the way she winced.

“I’m glad you’re going,” she said.

It sounded rehearsed, like she’d tried the line out on herself first.

I raised an eyebrow. “Are you?”

“Yes,” she said, with more conviction. “Of course I am. You were practically vibrating with purpose when you came back from Celeste’s. ‘Queensland needs systems, Lauren. They’re dressing people with vibes alone.’ You looked… lit up.”

“I did not vibrate,” I said.

“You did a little,” she said. “Here.” She tapped her own chestbone, just below the throat. “You get this… voltage. I like it.”

That admission landed somewhere between my ribs.

“I’m not worried about the work,” she went on. “You on a half-built site full of men who underestimate you is basically your natural habitat.”

“Flattering,” I said dryly.

“You know what I mean,” she said. “I’m worried about me. Here. In this flat. Without you. Which is ridiculous, because I lived alone for years and I was fine.”

The word fine hung between us, flimsy as a spiderweb.

“You weren’t fine,” I said gently. “You were functional.”

“Yes, well,” she said, staring into her tea. “Functional kept me alive.”

The admission came without heat this time. It was just data. Progress.

“I’m… not sure I remember how to do it now,” she added, even more quietly. “The alone thing. I don’t miss it. I don’t want to get good at it again.”

There it was: the emptiness, naked for a moment before she tried to tuck it away. My reflex was to rush in with reassurance, to plaster over the gap with practicalities.

Instead, I forced myself to sit with it a beat longer. To feel the twin ache in my own chest echoing hers.

“You won’t have to get good at it,” I said. “It’s a month, not exile. And you won’t be alone alone. You have Mara and Charli and a workroom full of women who would happily stuff me in a crate if I suggested you be left to your own devices.”

She smiled, briefly, then sobered.

“I know,” she said. “I know it’s only a month. I know we’ll talk. I know it’s not like when he left and took the oxygen with him and pretended it was my fault I couldn’t breathe.” Her hand tightened on the mug. “But when I think about you not… here… I feel this stupid hollow space in my chest and I’m annoyed at myself, because I don’t want to hand that kind of power to another human again.”

Her eyes flicked up to mine, wary. “Even you.”

There was a time when that would have hit like a slap. Now, I just felt a sharp, sympathetic pang. I knew exactly what she meant. Loving someone fiercely and knowing, in the same breath, that this gave them a certain jurisdiction over your nervous system—that was the adult version of holding your hand out over a flame and trusting them not to shove it closer.

“You’re not handing me power,” I said slowly. “You’re acknowledging that you care. That’s different. Power is what he had when you didn’t get a say. This—” I gestured between us “—is mutual. You think I’m not lying awake at three in the morning imagining this flat without your ridiculous hot-water-bottle rotation system?”

Her mouth twitched. “You love the rotation system.”

“I adore the rotation system,” I admitted. “But that’s not the point.”

She held my gaze, and for a second we just sat there, two allegedly grown women who had dealt with court forms and contracts that morning, still slightly floored by the discovery that willingly caring about another person could feel more terrifying than any legal document.

“We’re adults,” I said, because the phrase wanted to be said. “We’ve been through worse.”

Her eyebrows lifted, and I heard the hollowness of it in my own voice as I said it. It was the kind of thing people told themselves when they needed to get through another hour.

“Have we?” she asked softly.

I opened my mouth to say yes on principle, then stopped.

I had been through grief, through the slow erosion of friendships, through too many late nights in too many hospitals watching monitors beep. She had been through coercion and gaslighting and the long understatement of “domestic erosion”.

Neither of us, however, had done this before. Loving someone this hard and then choosing, together, to stretch that bond across geography for a while. Asking our hearts to hold tension and not snap.

“No,” I said finally. “I don’t think I have, actually. Not like this.”

“Me either,” she said.

The silence that followed felt different. Less like avoidance, more like an honest pause.

“I keep wanting to say ‘I’ll be fine’ so you’ll feel better about going,” she confessed. “And then I get angry with myself because I remember how I used to smile and say ‘I’m fine’ to him so he wouldn’t have to deal with the mess he’d made. I don’t want to do that again. Not with you.”

“That’s good,” I said, my chest doing a complicated twist. “Please don’t. I would rather have actual information than a performance.”

“Well, here’s some information,” she said, with that crisp, almost academic tone she used when presenting something she’d thought through. “I am happy you’re going. I am proud of you. I think Queensland will be lucky to have you. And I am also—” she took a breath “—dreading the first night without you here. Both things are true at once. I can hold both. I just don’t know how to say that without sounding like I’m trying to chain you to the sofa.”

“You just said it,” I pointed out. My voice came out rougher than I’d intended. “And for the record, that doesn’t make me want to stay. It makes me want to come back.”

Her eyes went shiny, fast.

“I didn’t want to burden you,” she whispered.

I laughed, quietly, because the alternative was tearing up on the spot.

“That’s the thing,” I said. “I’ve been trying not to burden you either. I went around for two days saying things like, ‘It’s only a month’ and ‘I’ll be busy, time will fly’ and ‘you’ll enjoy the quiet’—”

“I will not enjoy the quiet,” she cut in.

“I know,” I said. “Neither will I. I’m used to it now. The noise of you. The kettle. Your podcasts. The way you mutter at the news.”

She covered her face with one hand, as if that might hold something in.

“Ships,” she said from behind her fingers.

“What?”

“Ships in the night,” she said, lowering her hand. “That’s what it feels like. Both of us trying to glide past the other’s feelings so we don’t cause a collision, when what we actually need is to… dock. Or whatever.”

“That is a terrible metaphor,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “I’m emotionally compromised. You do better.”

“Absolutely not,” I said. “I’m sticking with ships now. It’s canon.”

Something in her expression cracked then, and the laugh that came out of her had a wet edge.

“I hate that you won’t be here,” she said, simple as that.

There it was, finally. No bracing, no caveats. Just the truth.

I pushed my chair back and came around the table before I could overthink it. She watched me approach like she wasn’t sure if I was about to kiss her or hand her another form to sign.

I slid my arms around her shoulders from behind and rested my chin on the top of her head.

“I hate that I won’t be here too,” I said into her hair. “I hate that I won’t be able to see your face when you lie and say ‘I’m fine’ at the lawyer’s, and then tell me later in the kitchen that you actually wanted to throw his stapler at the window.”

“I did want to throw his stapler at the window,” she said, voice muffled against my forearm.

“I know,” I said. “I saw the twitch.”

She let out a breath that shook all the way through her back into my chest. Her hands came up and gripped my forearms, holding on like I was the railing of a moving tram.

We stayed like that for a while, not talking, not trying to fix anything. Just two adults who had allegedly been through worse, discovering that this particular kind of ache was new and raw and oddly precious.

Eventually she tilted her head back enough to look up at me.

“They’d better have Wi-Fi up there in Maleny,” she said, with a steadiness I recognised from the lawyer’s office. “Because I already know I’ll need to see your lovely face.”

The word lovely landed with a small, bright shock. She didn’t throw it around lightly.

“I’ve been, you know,” I said. “Maleny.”

“Of course you have,” she muttered.

“It’s beautiful and damp and full of retirees and tourists who think a scarf is an identity,” I went on. “If they don’t have decent Wi-Fi, I’ll bully someone until they install it. Consider that a contractual condition.”

“Put it in the rider,” she said.

“I might,” I said. “Top of the list: ‘Wardrobe lead requires reliable internet connection to stare at her girlfriend’s face on a small screen and complain about Queensland humidity.’”

She went still.

“Girlfriend,” she repeated.

Ah. There it was. The word I hadn’t planned on testing out loud just yet, apparently having slipped past my internal quality control.

I felt my heart kick, once, hard.

“Too much?” I asked, because I was not, in fact, completely reckless.

She reached up, hooked a hand around the back of my neck, and pulled me down far enough to kiss me. It wasn’t urgent or frantic. It was slow and deliberate and had the shape of an answer.

When she let me breathe again, her eyes were damp and clear.

“Not too much,” she said. “Just accurate.”

The emptiness didn’t vanish. It settled, instead, into something we could both see and acknowledge, like a suitcase packed and waiting by the door. It would hurt to carry. It would be worth what we could do on the other end.

“We’ll be all right,” I said quietly, more to her shoulder than to her brain. “Not because we’ve been through worse. Because we’re doing this on purpose. Together.”

She nodded against me, the movement small and sure.

“Together,” she echoed.

For the first time since Queensland had become a solid thing on the calendar, I believed it.

“Yes,” she said, with more conviction. “Of course I am. You were practically vibrating with purpose when you came back from Celeste’s. ‘Queensland needs systems, Lauren. They’re dressing people with vibes alone.’ You looked… lit up.”

“I did not vibrate,” I said.

“You did a little,” she said. “Here.” She tapped her own chestbone, just below the throat. “You get this… voltage. I like it.”

That admission landed somewhere between my ribs.

“I’m not worried about the work,” she went on. “You on a half-built site full of men who underestimate you is basically your natural habitat.”

“Flattering,” I said dryly.

“You know what I mean,” she said. “I’m worried about me. Here. In this flat. Without you. Which is ridiculous, because I lived alone for years and I was fine.”

The word fine hung between us, flimsy as a spiderweb.

“You weren’t fine,” I said gently. “You were functional.”

“Yes, well,” she said, staring into her tea. “Functional kept me alive.”

The admission came without heat this time. It was just data. Progress.

“I’m… not sure I remember how to do it now,” she added, even more quietly. “The alone thing. I don’t miss it. I don’t want to get good at it again.”

There it was: the emptiness, naked for a moment before she tried to tuck it away. My reflex was to rush in with reassurance, to plaster over the gap with practicalities.

Instead, I forced myself to sit with it a beat longer. To feel the twin ache in my own chest echoing hers.

“You won’t have to get good at it,” I said. “It’s a month, not exile. And you won’t be alone alone. You have Mara and Charli and a workroom full of women who would happily stuff me in a crate if I suggested you be left to your own devices.”

She smiled, briefly, then sobered.

“I know,” she said. “I know it’s only a month. I know we’ll talk. I know it’s not like when he left and took the oxygen with him and pretended it was my fault I couldn’t breathe.” Her hand tightened on the mug. “But when I think about you not… here… I feel this stupid hollow space in my chest and I’m annoyed at myself, because I don’t want to hand that kind of power to another human again.”

Her eyes flicked up to mine, wary. “Even you.”

There was a time when that would have hit like a slap. Now, I just felt a sharp, sympathetic pang. I knew exactly what she meant. Loving someone fiercely and knowing, in the same breath, that this gave them a certain jurisdiction over your nervous system—that was the adult version of holding your hand out over a flame and trusting them not to shove it closer.

“You’re not handing me power,” I said slowly. “You’re acknowledging that you care. That’s different. Power is what he had when you didn’t get a say. This—” I gestured between us “—is mutual. You think I’m not lying awake at three in the morning imagining this flat without your ridiculous hot-water-bottle rotation system?”

Her mouth twitched. “You love the rotation system.”

“I adore the rotation system,” I admitted. “But that’s not the point.”

She held my gaze, and for a second we just sat there, two allegedly grown women who had dealt with court forms and contracts that morning, still slightly floored by the discovery that willingly caring about another person could feel more terrifying than any legal document.

“We’re adults,” I said, because the phrase wanted to be said. “We’ve been through worse.”

Her eyebrows lifted, and I heard the hollowness of it in my own voice as I said it. It was the kind of thing people told themselves when they needed to get through another hour.

“Have we?” she asked softly.

I opened my mouth to say yes on principle, then stopped.

I had been through grief, through the slow erosion of friendships, through too many late nights in too many hospitals watching monitors beep. She had been through coercion and gaslighting and the long understatement of “domestic erosion”.

Neither of us, however, had done this before. Loving someone this hard and then choosing, together, to stretch that bond across geography for a while. Asking our hearts to hold tension and not snap.

“No,” I said finally. “I don’t think I have, actually. Not like this.”

“Me either,” she said.

The silence that followed felt different. Less like avoidance, more like an honest pause.

“I keep wanting to say ‘I’ll be fine’ so you’ll feel better about going,” she confessed. “And then I get angry with myself because I remember how I used to smile and say ‘I’m fine’ to him so he wouldn’t have to deal with the mess he’d made. I don’t want to do that again. Not with you.”

“That’s good,” I said, my chest doing a complicated twist. “Please don’t. I would rather have actual information than a performance.”

“Well, here’s some information,” she said, with that crisp, almost academic tone she used when presenting something she’d thought through. “I am happy you’re going. I am proud of you. I think Queensland will be lucky to have you. And I am also—” she took a breath “—dreading the first night without you here. Both things are true at once. I can hold both. I just don’t know how to say that without sounding like I’m trying to chain you to the sofa.”

“You just said it,” I pointed out. My voice came out rougher than I’d intended. “And for the record, that doesn’t make me want to stay. It makes me want to come back.”

Her eyes went shiny, fast.

“I didn’t want to burden you,” she whispered.

I laughed, quietly, because the alternative was tearing up on the spot.

“That’s the thing,” I said. “I’ve been trying not to burden you either. I went around for two days saying things like, ‘It’s only a month’ and ‘I’ll be busy, time will fly’ and ‘you’ll enjoy the quiet’—”

“I will not enjoy the quiet,” she cut in.

“I know,” I said. “Neither will I. I’m used to it now. The noise of you. The kettle. Your podcasts. The way you mutter at the news.”

She covered her face with one hand, as if that might hold something in.

“Ships,” she said from behind her fingers.

“What?”

“Ships in the night,” she said, lowering her hand. “That’s what it feels like. Both of us trying to glide past the other’s feelings so we don’t cause a collision, when what we actually need is to… dock. Or whatever.”

“That is a terrible metaphor,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “I’m emotionally compromised. You do better.”

“Absolutely not,” I said. “I’m sticking with ships now. It’s canon.”

Something in her expression cracked then, and the laugh that came out of her had a wet edge.

“I hate that you won’t be here,” she said, simple as that.

There it was, finally. No bracing, no caveats. Just the truth.

I pushed my chair back and came around the table before I could overthink it. She watched me approach like she wasn’t sure if I was about to kiss her or hand her another form to sign.

I slid my arms around her shoulders from behind and rested my chin on the top of her head.

“I hate that I won’t be here too,” I said into her hair. “I hate that I won’t be able to see your face when you lie and say ‘I’m fine’ at the lawyer’s, and then tell me later in the kitchen that you actually wanted to throw his stapler at the window.”

“I did want to throw his stapler at the window,” she said, voice muffled against my forearm.

“I know,” I said. “I saw the twitch.”

She let out a breath that shook all the way through her back into my chest. Her hands came up and gripped my forearms, holding on like I was the railing of a moving tram.

We stayed like that for a while, not talking, not trying to fix anything. Just two adults who had allegedly been through worse, discovering that this particular kind of ache was new and raw and oddly precious.

Eventually she tilted her head back enough to look up at me.

“They’d better have Wi-Fi up there in Maleny,” she said, with a steadiness I recognised from the lawyer’s office. “Because I already know I’ll need to see your lovely face.”

The word lovely landed with a small, bright shock. She didn’t throw it around lightly.

“I’ve been, you know,” I said. “Maleny.”

“Of course you have,” she muttered.

“It’s beautiful and damp and full of retirees and tourists who think a scarf is an identity,” I went on. “If they don’t have decent Wi-Fi, I’ll bully someone until they install it. Consider that a contractual condition.”

“Put it in the rider,” she said.

“I might,” I said. “Top of the list: ‘Wardrobe lead requires reliable internet connection to stare at her girlfriend’s face on a small screen and complain about Queensland humidity.’”

She went still.

“Girlfriend,” she repeated.

Ah. There it was. The word I hadn’t planned on testing out loud just yet, apparently having slipped past my internal quality control.

I felt my heart kick, once, hard.

“Too much?” I asked, because I was not, in fact, completely reckless.

She reached up, hooked a hand around the back of my neck, and pulled me down far enough to kiss me. It wasn’t urgent or frantic. It was slow and deliberate and had the shape of an answer.

When she let me breathe again, her eyes were damp and clear.

“Not too much,” she said. “Just accurate.”

The emptiness didn’t vanish. It settled, instead, into something we could both see and acknowledge, like a suitcase packed and waiting by the door. It would hurt to carry. It would be worth what we could do on the other end.

“We’ll be all right,” I said quietly, more to her shoulder than to her brain. “Not because we’ve been through worse. Because we’re doing this on purpose. Together.”

She nodded against me, the movement small and sure.

“Together,” she echoed.

For the first time since Queensland had become a solid thing on the calendar, I believed it.

By the time we got back from the lawyer’s office, the afternoon light had gone that thin, metallic colour that made everything in the street look slightly unreal.

Lauren unlocked the front door like it was an exam she’d revised for. Key in, turn, shoulder to the wood. No hesitation. A few weeks earlier she would have paused, braced, checked the street twice for threats only she could see. Today she just opened the door and walked in, back straight, bag on her shoulder.

I followed with the folder of documents under my arm, feeling oddly excess to requirement. The lawyer had been competent and dry, the good kind of boring. She hadn’t promised miracles, but she’d calmly dismantled Roger’s “you’ll get nothing” threats, sketching out an asset pool that actually had Lauren in it. She’d explained that the court would look at contributions and future needs, not just whose name was on the title; that years of homemaking, shifted shifts and unpaid admin for his business all counted. Lauren had walked in with only the divorce on her mind and stepped out of the office still surprised that she was actually entitled to something. She was no longer a penniless extra in Roger’s story—more like someone with a small, solid claim the law would actually recognise. There were timelines now, forms, a clear process for untangling the house from Roger. The spectre of “you might see him again” had been named and pinned to a calendar instead of floating in every hallway.

Lauren kicked her shoes off and headed for the kitchen.

“Tea?” she called over her shoulder.

“Please,” I said. My voice sounded normal, which felt like a small miracle.

I dropped the folder on the dining table and stood there for a second with my hands on the back of one chair, listening to the familiar sounds: kettle filled, mug cupboard opened, her small, irritated noise when one handle caught on another. The domestic soundtrack of a life that had been frayed and was slowly knitting back together.

I should have felt proud. I did, partly. She’d sat in that lawyer’s office and asked sensible questions about titles and settlements and what happened if he tried to drag things out. Her fingers had only trembled once, when she signed the first form. Even then, she’d steadied herself with one deep breath and a small, private shake of her shoulders, like a swimmer before a cold pool.

The thing I hadn’t expected was the aftertaste of it.

We were, technically, moving forward. Paperwork. Plans. The kind of structure my brain usually loved.

Instead, I felt like someone had quietly removed one of the load-bearing walls inside me and told me to pretend I didn’t notice.

Lauren came back in with two mugs and set one in front of me. She’d tied her hair up before we left; a strand had come loose and was curling damply against her temple. There was a tiny ink smudge on her thumb from signing so many times. I had the sudden, irrational urge to grab her hand and try to lick it off, just to prove she was here, ink and all.

She sat opposite me and wrapped both hands around her mug.

“So,” she said briskly. “We have a plan.”

“We do,” I said.

“In a few weeks, they lodge the thing,” she went on. “He gets notified, he sulks, he maybe makes noises, but legally, he can’t do much except drag his feet. In six months—give or take—I am no longer tied to him by brick and mortar.”

“Yes,” I said again.

She looked at me over the rim of her mug.

“You don’t have to keep saying yes,” she said. “You’re allowed to use other words. You’re the chatty one, remember.”

Normally, that would have earned her a smirk. Today it just made my throat tighten.

“I’m thinking.”

“Dangerous,” she deadpanned, then softened. “What about?”

You. Leaving. Me leaving. Both of us moving away from lives where “alone” was standard.

“The timing of everything,” I said, which was true without being the whole truth. “Queensland. The house. You having to see him again. Me not being here when that happens.”

There it was, half out in the open.

She stiffened almost imperceptibly.

“Ah,” she said. “That.”

We hadn’t talked about Queensland since Celeste’s Thai-and-triage lunch. I’d told Celeste I was in before the question had fully left her mouth. It had been the easiest call I’d made all week. Of course I was going. Outerwear, fittings, teaching baby costumers how not to melt garments on contact—that was my terrain.

The hard part had been walking home afterwards with the knowledge that for a month, Lauren’s bed would be missing one chronically organised, emotionally constipated lesbian.

She took a sip of tea that was probably too hot, judging by the way she winced.

“Hey, I’m glad you’re going,” she said.

It sounded rehearsed, like she’d tried the line out on herself first.

I raised an eyebrow. “Are you?”

“Yes,” she said, with more conviction. “Of course I am. You were practically vibrating with purpose when you came back from Celeste’s. ‘Queensland needs systems, Lauren. They’re dressing people with vibes alone.’ You looked… so lit up.”

“I did not vibrate,” I said.

“You did a little,” she said. “Here.” She tapped her own chestbone, just below the throat. “You get this… voltage. I like it.”

That admission landed somewhere between my ribs.

“I’m not worried about the work,” she went on. “You on a half-built site full of men who underestimate you is basically your natural habitat.”

“Flattering,” I said dryly.

“You know what I mean,” she said. “I’m just worried about me, frankly. Here. In this flat. Without you. Which is ridiculous, because I lived alone for years and I was fine.”

The word fine hung between us, flimsy as a spiderweb.

“You weren’t fine,” I said gently. “You were functional.”

“Yes, well,” she said, staring into her tea. “Functional kept me alive.”

The admission came without heat this time. It was just data. Progress.

“I’m… not sure I remember how to do it now,” she added, even more quietly. “The alone thing. I don’t miss it. I don’t want to get good at it again.”

There it was: the emptiness, naked for a moment before she tried to tuck it away. My reflex was to rush in with reassurance, to plaster over the gap with practicalities.

“You won’t have to get good at it,” I said. “It’s a month, not exile. And you won’t be alone alone. You have Mara and Lucy and Celeste and a workroom full of women who would happily stuff me in a crate if I suggested you be left to your own devices.”

She smiled, briefly, then sobered.

“I know,” she said. “I know it’s only a month. I know we’ll talk. I know it’s not like when, at first, he would leave and take the oxygen with him and then pretend it was my fault I couldn’t breathe.” Her hand tightened on the mug. “But when I think about you not… here… I feel this stupid hollow space in my chest and I’m annoyed at myself, because I don’t want to hand that kind of power to another human again.”

Her mouth twitched. “Don’t give me that. You love the rotation system.”

“I adore the rotation system,” I admitted. “But that’s not the point.”

She held my gaze, and for a second we just sat there, two allegedly grown women who had dealt with court forms and contracts that morning, still slightly floored by the discovery that willingly caring about another person could feel more terrifying than any legal document.

When she let me breathe again, her eyes were damp and clear.

“Not too much, at all,” she said. “Perfectly accurate.”

The emptiness didn’t vanish. It settled, instead, into something we could both see and acknowledge, like a suitcase packed and waiting by the door. It would hurt to carry. It would be worth what we could do on the other end.

“We’ll be all right,” I said quietly, more to her shoulder than to her brain. “Not because we’ve been through worse. Because we’re doing this on purpose. Together.”
