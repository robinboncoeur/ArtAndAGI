✨ The Brush ✨
Charli stared in front of her. A tear slid down her cheek. She didn’t lift a hand to wipe it away—hands folded in her lap as if even that small movement might tip her into pieces.

I felt that instinct again—sharp, urgent—the urge to close the distance, to put my arms around her and make her stop shaking. I hated how badly I wanted it.

But I didn’t move.

I made myself stay where I was. This was time for structure, not comfort.

“This is not how to do it,” I said, forcing my voice slow. Calm. “This isn’t safe. It isn’t *supervised*.”

The word hung between us.

She didn’t look up.

I watched her breathe—little, uneven pulls—as if the air had turned heavy.

And then I saw it. Not just fear. *Grief.* The kind that comes when something precious is threatened.

My tone softened before I even decided to let it.

“Is it…” I began carefully, testing the surface. “Is it because you’re scared the girls will stop… seeing you?”

Her whole body recoiled. A shudder, instant and involuntary—as if the idea itself was poison.

“Don’t,” she whispered.

I nodded once. An apology without saying sorry.

“Okay,” I said. “Not that.”

I kept my eyes on her face, not to interrogate, but to hold steady for her.

“Then tell me what it was,” I said, quieter. “Not what you were afraid *they* would think. What it felt like in you.”

Her mouth trembled. She swallowed.

“It was horrible,” she managed. “The changes I didn’t think would happen were… happening.” Her voice cracked. “It made me *sick*.”

“Sick,” I echoed softly—not correcting, not translating. “Like nausea?”

A tiny nod.

“Like panic?”

Another nod, sharper.

“Like…” I chose the words with care, as if they were glass. “Like your body didn’t feel like yours anymore.”

That did it. Her breath broke.

“Yes.” The word came out small and raw, and then she shook her head like she couldn’t bear the rest. “I didn’t want it to… to go away.”

“Didn’t want *what* to go away?” I asked—direct, but not hard. The question had weight, yes, but it wasn’t a blow. It was a handrail.

She closed her eyes, eyes bright when they opened again.

“The… the girls. The room. You.” She drew in a shuddering breath. “I didn’t want—” The words spilled, messy and honest. “I didn’t want *me* to go away.”

Something in me stilled.

“I believe you,” I said immediately.

Her shoulders dropped a fraction, as if that sentence had taken some of the load.

“And,” I added, because love without structure would be a lie, “we don’t answer that kind of fear with secrecy.”

She flinched again, smaller this time.

“We answer it properly,” I said. “With supervision. With bloodwork. With someone watching what your body is doing—so you don’t have to be brave in the dark.”

Her lower lip trembled.

“You’re going to take it away,” she whispered.

I shook my head, slow.

“I’m going to take away the *alone* part,” I said. “Not your life.”

✨ The Brush ✨

Her lips trembled. “But it was *working*.”

The way she said it—small, desperate—made my chest ache. Because of course it had been working. It had given her a sense of control. It had quieted the terror chewing at her. It had let her smile without fear.

And she had done it alone. I reached out and put my hand over the bottle. Not possessive. Not dramatic. Simply covering it. Claiming responsibility.

“I’m taking this.”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No—” she whispered, panic and pleading chasing each other across her face.

“Yes.”

The word came out clean. Final.

Then, after a beat—because I could see her tipping toward panic—I added, quieter: “Not as punishment.”

Her breath hitched.

“As harm control,” I said. “And because I’m not leaving you to manage this by yourself.”

Charli stared at me like she was trying to work out whether she’d heard that last part correctly.

“Look,” I said, and I kept my voice as gentle as I could without letting it turn vague, “you’re not being punished, Charli. But you *cannot* do this without medical oversight. Do you understand me?”

Her breath trembled in her throat. A long moment passed. Finally, she nodded, small.

“Yes,” she whispered.

I picked up my phone.

“Who are you calling?” she asked, voice tight.

“Your mum.”

Her face went white.

“Mum—”

“Charli, listen.” The firmness in my voice surprised me—because it was threaded with something else now, something I didn’t want her to see. “We are not doing this alone. We are not keeping secrets that can harm you. Your mum needs to know. We need to get you professional help.”

Charli seemed to shrink into herself. She sat silent while I retrieved my phone. When I returned to the kitchen, she looked like she’d stepped backward through time: shoulders rounded, towel clutched like armour, eyes shining with unspilled tears.

“Please don’t hate me.”

That was worse than finding the bottle.

I stepped closer. I wanted—instinctively—to comfort her with softness, to wrap her in reassurance until she stopped trembling.

And I could feel, in the same breath, the danger of that: how easily comfort could become a hook. How quickly she could learn to rely on me as a shelter instead of learning to stand.

So I anchored her with fact.

“Charli,” I said, “I don’t hate you.” I watched her swallow. “I *am* angry you did something unsafe. And I’m angry you thought you had to do it alone. But I do not hate you.”

A tear slid down her cheek. She wiped it away quickly, ashamed of it.

I dialled.

### Revised version 
(Charli compliant, relief present, Celeste steady + soft)

Her lips trembled. “But it was *working*.”

The way she said it—small, frightened—made my chest ache. Because of course it had been working. It had given her a sense of control. It had quieted the terror chewing at her. It had let her inhabit herself without flinching.

And she had done it alone.

I didn’t reach for the bottle like it was contraband. I reached for it the way you reach for a hot pan when someone’s about to burn themselves—quick, careful, without theatrics.

I laid my hand over it.

Not possessive. Not dramatic.

Just… covering it. Taking responsibility.

“I’m taking this,” I said.

Charli’s eyes widened, but there wasn’t fight in them. Just a rush of fear—then a pause, like she was testing whether I meant what I’d said before.

I kept my voice quiet.

“Not as punishment.”

Her breath hitched.

“As harm control,” I said. “And because I’m not leaving you to manage this by yourself.”

She stared at my hand on the bottle as if the room had shifted and she was trying to find her footing.

Then, very softly, as if saying it might undo it:

“…You’re not angry at *me*?”

The question turned my throat tight.

“I’m angry you were put in a position where this felt like your only option,” I said. “And I’m angry you did it without oversight.” I held her gaze. “But I’m not angry at you for wanting your life.”

Her shoulders sagged—just a fraction. Relief, thin and trembling, but real.

“Look at me,” I said, gentler than I meant to be. “You are not being punished, Charli. But you *cannot* do this without medical supervision. Do you understand me?”

She nodded, small, immediate.

“Yes.”

I picked up my phone.

Her voice went tight again. “What… what are you doing?”

“I’m calling your mum.”

The colour drained from her face.

“Mum—”

“I know.” I kept my tone calm, almost tender, because this was the part that would feel like falling. “This is the grown-up part, okay? Not because you’re in trouble. Because this needs to be safe.”

Charli swallowed. Her hands curled into the towel on her lap, knuckles whitening, but she didn’t pull away from me. She didn’t argue. She just sat very still, trying to be brave in the open.

“I don’t want her to think…” She couldn’t finish.

“I won’t let her think the wrong thing,” I said. “I’m going to tell her the truth: that you were scared, and you tried to solve it, and it has to be supervised.”

Her eyes shone—tears held stubbornly in place.

“You’ll stay?” she whispered, and hated herself for asking even as the words left her.

My chest tightened.

“Yes,” I said simply. “I’m right here.”

She nodded again, like she was filing it away as a fact she could survive on.

I dialled.

While it rang, Charli stared at the tabletop as if she could anchor herself there. One tear slid down her cheek. This time she didn’t wipe it away. She just let it fall—quiet, unperformed—while I kept my voice steady and made the call.

## Scene 30
### “The Brush”

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116an.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

✨ The Brush ✨

[Celeste]

Wardrobe had learned, over the last three months, to run like a body instead of a panic. Not because the work was easier—if anything it had become more precise, more demanding—but because the women inside it had stopped wasting effort on uncertainty. Tools had homes. Labels existed. The ledger sat where it belonged: open when it needed to be open, shut when it didn’t. Even Mara’s silences had started to feel less like weather and more like method.

And Charli?

Charli moved through the room as if she’d finally stopped expecting to be told she was in the way.

She arrived early, same as always, but the early-ness had changed. It used to feel like an apology; now it felt like preference. She hung her bag on the hook, washed her hands with the same thoroughness, but without the old tremor of performance. She laughed sometimes, quietly, and the laugh stayed in the air instead of disappearing the second it appeared.

She had become easier to look at, not because she was “prettier” but because she was less afraid. And because she’d begun to occupy her skin like it belonged to her.

Mara set the next test on the table without ceremony: a cap and kerchief combination we’d been refining for the Faire women, an accessory that had to survive heat, sweat, pins, movement, and the indignity of being yanked off and shoved into a tote bag between scenes.

“Hair,” Mara said, glancing at Charli as if hair was a tool to call for. “Fix it.”

Charli touched her hair reflexively, as if a problem had just been identified. She had tied it back in her customary scruffy ponytail. It was not with the discipline the cap required. Loose strands would catch. Pins would slip. The cap would migrate.

Tahlia, measuring a sleeve nearby, made a small amused noise. Lucy didn’t look up from her work. Sarah, perched like a crow on a stool, watched with the bright interest she reserved for social developments.

Charli stepped toward the mirror with a comb with an uncertain bite of the lips.

I moved without thinking.

“Sit.”

Charli looked at me as if I’d told her to do a pirouette. Then she sat—carefully, obediently—still holding her breath a little, with unsure sidelong glances. I reached for the brush: an ordinary, wooden-handled thing, bristles clogged with hair.

When I drew it through her hair the first time, Charli went very still. Not tense or flinching: attentive.

That attention always did something to me. Not the attention itself but the way she was trusting me. The way she let herself be guided without making a show of it. 

The brush made that low, dry sound a brush makes on clean, long hair. I worked from the ends up, practical. Untangle. Smooth. Part. No pulling. No fuss.

“Hold your head,” I said. “Don’t tip back.”

“Yes,” she murmured, and then—an old reflex, soft as a bruise: “Sorry.”

I stopped the brush for half a beat and shook my head.

“Don’t apologise. Just hold still.”

“Okay.”

The room didn’t pause around us. Mara’s shears kept snicking. Fabric slid. Pins clicked. The kettle somewhere did what kettles do. I gathered Charli’s hair at the nape, measured the tension with my fingers, and began to twist it into a coil that would sit properly beneath the cap. The nape of her neck was warm from the room and from the shower she’d clearly taken before coming in—clean, faintly soap-scented. My fingers registered it the way they registered everything: temperature, texture, compliance.

And then, annoyingly, something else—a small, involuntary tenderness—welled inside: it slowed me for half a second.

Pins went in with the same economy we used for everything: enough to hold, not so many a hairdo became a hedgehog. Sarah’s voice floated over from her stool.

“Look at that,” she said, pleased. “She looks... civilised.”

Charli smiled, an actual smile, one that reached her eyes.

Lucy looked up long enough to say, “If she keeps her hair like that, the cap will sit properly. If she doesn’t, it’ll ride.”

“Thank you,” Charli said automatically.

Lucy shrugged. “It’s just geometry.”

I set the cap on Charli’s head and adjusted the angle. The kerchief followed, tied firmly enough to hold, not so tight it would dig. I checked the line at the forehead, the way the fabric framed her face.

For a second, only a second, I saw it. This was not Charli donning a costume. No, there was a rightness... so quiet yet so clearly there, it made me swallow. She fit into the room around her, which had finally stopped arguing about it.

I should have stepped back then. I should have treated it like any other fit check. Instead, my hand lingered at her temple a fraction too long, flattening a flyaway strand that didn’t actually matter. Charli didn’t move. She simply breathed, steadily, as if she knew this was safe. She was safe.

I made myself withdraw.

“Turn your head left.”

She turned.

“Right.”

She turned.

“Good.”

Mara glanced over, saw the fit, and gave a single curt nod: approval, in Mara’s language.

“Now move,” Mara said. “Sweat. Bend. Prove it.”

Charli rose and began the wear-test: bending to reach fabric on the lower shelves, turning quickly, lifting her arms, moving through the narrow spaces between tables. The cap held. The kerchief held. The pins did their job. Tahlia watched her with a faint grin. Bree appeared in the doorway mid-test, took one look, and beamed.

“Oh, she looks proper Missy!”

The room laughed, and I saw Charli go pink: a soft, bashful warmth. Bree clapped once, delighted.

“Right then. She’s coming tonight... aren't you, petal?”

“She’s coming,” Tahlia agreed.

Charli gave me a quick side-long glance, like she was checking whether I approved of tonight, not just the cap. I gave her a small nod. Calm. And felt, under that calm, a strangely protective satisfaction.

The day moved on.

The cap survived sweat and motion. The kerchief didn’t slip. The ledger received its notes. Mara’s shears kept snicking. The room kept laughing. And Charli kept laughing with it. Not small.

Real.

---

That evening, at home, the quiet enveloped me the way it always did after Wardrobe: like walking out of a river and realising your ears had been full of water.

Charli was in the shower. I could hear the muted rush behind the bathroom door, the steady sound of water striking tile. I moved through the apartment, tidying without thinking. Habit. Reset the space. Put things back where they belonged.

Her bag was on the chair. Not thrown there: placed, as if it had been arranged to look casual.

I don’t know what made me look. It wasn’t suspicion, just the same part of my brain that notices seam strain and pin tension. It was the part that registered when something was slightly too controlled. I lifted the bag and felt the weight shift in a way that didn’t match fabric.

I opened it.

Inside, tucked under folded cloth and a small notebook, was a pharmacy bottle. White plastic. Printed label.

My stomach dropped.

Spironolactone.

The name sat on the label like a fact that refused to be softened by context. I’d heard of it... an anti-androgen, a testosterone blocker. Prescription-only.

It was almost empty. Empty enough to make the decision behind it feel old, not impulsive.

For a moment I couldn’t move: not because I didn’t know what to do, but because the first thought wasn’t policy or risk or responsibility. It was: 

I could lose her.

Not in the abstract. Not in a headline. In my kitchen.

I shut that thought down so hard it felt like I’d bitten my own tongue.

My next impulse was anger: hot and sharp and immediate.

Not at her. At the risk.

At the secrecy.

At the thought of her taking anything unsupervised, unmonitored, unrecorded. That she felt she had to do this—put herself into unwitnessed triage—no safeguards, no bloodwork, no one watching the numbers—no one checking what it was doing to her.

That awakened a colder realisation, steady enough to make me still: this wasn’t rebellion.

This was a solution.

A private solution. Her solution.

A girl trying to keep her place in a room of women by any means available.

I closed the bag carefully, as if the bottle might explode.

Then I opened it again and took the bottle out. There was no point pretending I hadn’t seen it. There was no point leaving it there like a trap. The bottle was evidence; it represented danger. I set it on the kitchen table and waited.

The shower stopped. A door opened. Footsteps. The soft sound of Charli’s towel rubbing through her hair. She came into the kitchen in a t-shirt and 'trackies', damp hair loose around her shoulders, face relaxed in a way I hadn’t seen months ago. 

She looked... good. Warm. Light. The sight of that warmth, that lightness, made something in me hold its breath.

Then she saw the bottle.

All the light left her face.

She stopped so abruptly it was like she’d hit a wall. Her eyes, widening with fear, flicked to mine, then down to the bottle, then back up. In that moment, she wasn’t Charli of the workroom... laughing, included, adopted. She was bracing... terrified. 

Trying to calculate what it would happen next.

“Where did you get it?”

My voice came out quiet. Low. The way you speak when you’re trying not to add fear to fear.

Charli’s throat moved. “I—” She paused.

“Charli.” I said her name like a hand placed firmly on a shoulder. “Answer me.”

She swallowed. “Online.”

“How long?”

Her eyes dropped.

“How long,” I repeated, and I heard my own restraint in it, how carefully I was keeping the edge out. She breathed in, shallow.

“Almost four months.” Her voice was so soft, I could barely hear it. But the words were as loud in my head as if she'd screamed them.

Four months.

Long enough for it to become her routine. Long enough for it to affect her body. Long enough for her to build her happiness on it. I let my breath out through my nose, slow, fighting to stay calm.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

Charli’s hands twisted in the edge of her towel. She didn’t look up.

“I didn’t want...” she began, and her voice cracked. “I didn’t want it to... to go away.”

“Didn’t want what to go away?”

The question wasn’t meant to be unkind: it was necessary—plain and steady—and it landed with weight; it made her shiver.

“The... the girls. The room. You. I didn’t want...” She took in a shuddering breath, her eyes bright with unshed tears. The words came spilling out, messy and honest.

“I was changing. It was horrible. The changes I didn’t think would happen were... happening. It made me sick. I was scared I was going to...”

She didn’t finish.

She didn’t have to.

There it was.

Not vanity.

Fear.

Fear of being returned to the life that had always hurt, just because biology was betraying her.

“This is not how to do it.” I forced myself to speak slowly, calmly. “This isn’t safe. It isn’t supervised.”

Charli stared in front of her. A tear slid down her cheek. She didn’t lift a hand to wipe it away—hands folded in her lap as if even that small movement might tip her into pieces.

I felt that instinct again—sharp, urgent—the urge to close the distance, to put my arms around her and make her stop shaking. I hated how badly I wanted it.

But I didn’t move.

I made myself stay where I was. I watched her breathe—little, uneven pulls—as if the air had turned heavy. And then I saw it. 

Not just fear. 

Grief. 

The kind that comes when something precious is threatened. My tone softened before I even decided to let it.

“Is it...” I began carefully, testing the surface. “Is it because you’re scared the girls will stop... seeing you?”

She shook her head. I nodded: an apology without saying sorry.

“Okay,” I said. “Not that.” I kept my eyes on her face, not to interrogate, but to hold steady for her.

“Then tell me what it was,” I said, quieter. “Not what you were afraid they would think. What it felt like in you.”

Her mouth trembled. She swallowed.

“It was horrible,” she managed. “The changes... I didn’t think they would happen, but they were... happening.” Her voice cracked. “It made me sick.”

“Sick,” I echoed softly, genuinely puzzled. “Like nausea?”

A tiny nod. I felt my mouth drop open as a realisation struck.

“Like panic?”

Another nod, sharper.

“Like...” I chose the words with care, as if they were glass. “Like your body... didn’t feel like... yours anymore.”

That did it. Her breath broke.

“Yes.” The word came out small and raw, and then she shook her head like she couldn’t bear the rest. “I didn’t want it to... to be different.” She drew in a shuddering breath. “I didn’t want me to go away.”

Something in me stilled.

“I believe you,” I said quietly. Her shoulders dropped a fraction, as if I had taken some of her load. “And,” I added, because love without structure would be a lie, “we don’t answer that kind of fear with secrecy. We answer it properly, with supervision. With bloodwork. With someone watching what your body is doing—so you don’t have to be brave in the dark.”

Her lower lip trembled, her red eyes on the bottle.

“But you’re going to take it away,” she whispered.

I shook my head, slow.

“No, I’m only going to take away the alone part,” I said. “Not your life.”

Her lips trembled. “The medicine was working.”

The way she said it—small, frightened—made my chest ache. Because of course it had been working. It had given her a sense of control. It had quieted the terror chewing at her. It had let her inhabit herself without flinching.

And she had done it alone.

I didn’t reach for the bottle like it was contraband. I reached for it the way you reach for a hot pan when someone’s about to burn themselves—quick, careful, without theatrics. I laid my hand over it. Not possessive or dramatic. Just... covering it. Taking responsibility.

Charli’s eyes widened, but there wasn’t fight in them. Just a rush of fear—then a pause, like she was testing whether I meant what I’d said before. She stared at my hand on the bottle as if the room had shifted and she was trying to find her footing. Then, very softly, as if saying it might undo it:

“You’re not angry at me?”

The question tightened my throat. My eyes burned. I couldn’t let tears take the wheel—not now—but the terror of the road she’d taken alone rose up so fast it made me dizzy. I shook my head.

“I’m angry you were put in a position where this felt like your only option,” I said. “And I’m angry you did it without oversight.” I held her gaze. “But I’m not angry at you for wanting your life.”

Her shoulders sagged—just a fraction. Relief, thin and trembling, but real.

“Look at me, Charli,” I said, gentler than I meant to be. “This is your life. I’m not taking it out of your hands—I’m making sure you don’t have to do everything alone. We need medical supervision. Do you understand?”

She nodded, small, immediate.

“Yes.”

I picked up my phone.

“What... what are you doing?” Her voice had gone tight again.

“I’m calling your mum.”

The colour drained from her face.

“Mum—”

“I know.” I kept my tone calm, almost tender, because this was the part that would feel like falling. “This is the grown-up part, okay? Not because you’re in trouble: because this needs to be safe.”

Charli swallowed. Her hands curled into the towel on her lap, knuckles whitening, but she didn’t pull away from me. She didn’t argue. She just sat very still, trying to be brave.

“I didn’t want her to think...” She couldn’t finish.

“I won’t let her think the wrong thing,” I said. “I’m going to tell her the truth: that you were scared, and you tried to solve it, and it has to be supervised.”

Her eyes shone again with tears she held stubbornly in place.

I dialled.

While it rang, Charli stared at the tabletop as if she could anchor herself there. One tear slid down her cheek: she didn’t wipe it away. She just let it fall—quiet, unperformed—while I kept my voice steady and made the call.

When Lauren answered, I didn’t waste words.

“I found a medication in Charli’s bag,” I said. “An anti-androgen—spironolactone. She’s been getting it without a clinician involved. She’s been taking it for months.”

There was a pause on the line, a silence with weight. Then Lauren’s voice, tight but present.

“Is she okay right now?”

“If you mean physically, she seems okay,” I said. “She’s stable—breathing fine, coherent, not fainting or anything like that. But she’s been frightened, Lauren. She tried to handle something alone that shouldn’t be handled alone. I’ve secured the medication and I’m right here with her. Next step is medical oversight—bloodwork, a plan—as soon as we can.”

Another pause. I could hear Lauren breathing, holding herself together the way mothers do when the world tries to fracture them.

“I’m coming over.”

“Please,” I replied. “We need a plan. Specialists. People who actually understand this. Whatever the pathway is from here, we do it properly.”

Lauren’s voice steadied on the word 'properly', as if grabbing it with both hands.

“Yes,” she said quietly. “Yes. We do it properly.”

I ended the call and looked at Charli. She stood in the kitchen with her towel clutched to her chest, face raw, frightened eyes fixed on me.

“We are going to get you help with this, Charli,” I said. “The right way. The proper way. Your happiness is important.”

Charli nodded, the hopelessness slowly easing from her shoulders. Her red eyes sought mine.

I held her gaze.

And I let myself, for one heartbeat, simply look at her—at the damp hair, the bare face, the trembling mouth—and realised with a gut-wrenching suddenness: this were not a problem to manage but a girl I... cared about more than I had planned to. 

I quickly put that aside: I had to, before it softened me into uselessness.

“There will be a series of boring appointments,” I said, letting the promise be what it was—structure, safety. “Questions. Paperwork. Waiting.”

Her mouth trembled less.

“Okay.”

The word came out in a whisper. And in that whisper I heard everything she hadn’t said in words:

I’m tired of being afraid.  
I’m tired of feeling it creep in—and not being able to stop it.   
If there’s a way forward that doesn’t make me sick… I choose it.

“We start tomorrow.”

Charli nodded. In that nod I saw her again—the Charli who could let structure hold her; the structure she’d been craving, the structure she’d tried to mimic with a bottle and a secret.

The apartment settled into a hush that reminded me of Wardrobe after hours: still, intentional, waiting.

And with a clarity that made my thoughts go almost cold, I understood: whatever she’d done to keep her happiness safe inside her own body—whatever private answer she’d found—had fused itself to her sense of self. Taking it away wasn’t just taking a pill. It was pulling away the scaffolding she’d built to stand upright.

So we’d have to give her something real in its place. Something supervised. Something that didn’t depend on fear.

And we’d have to do it gently enough that she stayed whole.
