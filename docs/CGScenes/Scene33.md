✨ Commute ✨

**Scene 33 — “Commute” (Celeste POV, past tense)**

We left Wardrobe the way women leave a place that has held them all day: quietly, efficiently, without ceremony.

The workroom behind us was still full of breath—steam residue, starch, the faint sweetness of fabric warmed by irons—but the corridor outside had that cooler, emptied feel. End of day. Lights not yet dimmed, but already less intimate. The building exhaled.

Charli walked beside me with her tote hugged close to her hip. She’d been steady all afternoon—competent hands, quiet yeses—but there was a softness to her face now that read like aftermath. Not fragility exactly.

More like she was still holding herself together by habit.

I didn’t ask about the appointment. Not in the work corridor, not where anyone could come around a corner and hear a private thing turn into gossip by accident. And because I could still hear last night in my head: *Some things belong to mother and daughter alone.*

Outside, the air had cooled. We stood at the stop with two other commuters and a woman on her phone, and Charli kept her eyes on the road as if she could summon the bus by will.

When it arrived, we climbed aboard. I tapped on. Charli followed. We took the pair of seats near the back where the ride was smoother and fewer eyes lingered.

She sat by the window.

Of course she did.

For a while we said nothing. The bus rocked gently over patched bitumen. The city slid by in pieces: shopfronts, trees, a mechanic’s yard, a school oval gone gold in the late light. The ordinary world doing its ordinary thing, indifferent to the fact that inside this bus a seventeen-year-old had just walked out of a clinic holding a folded piece of paper that felt like a map out of the dark.

Charli smoothed the edge of her tote strap with her thumb. Again. Again.

I watched her hands because watching her face felt like asking too much of her.

After three stops she spoke, still looking out the window.

“She didn’t say much,” she said.

I didn’t pretend not to know who she meant.

“Lauren,” I said quietly.

Charli nodded once.

“She was… steady,” she added, like it surprised her. Like she’d expected anger or humiliation or punishment and had instead found a mother who did something much harder: held the line and stayed.

I felt something ease in my chest.

“Your mum’s good at being an adult,” I said. “Even when it hurts.”

Charli’s throat moved. She swallowed.

“She looked at me like…” She stopped. Started again. “Like she was trying to see me properly.”

The words landed softly, and the ache in them was sharp.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s what she was doing.”

Charli’s fingers tightened on the tote strap.

“And she…” Her voice got thinner. “She said she could learn.”

I glanced at her, careful.

“That’s not nothing,” I said.

“No.” Another swallow. “It’s just… the way she said it. Like she didn’t hate it, but… she didn’t—” Charli’s breath hitched, frustrated by her own lack of language. “It’s new in her mouth.”

I could hear Lauren saying it. Could hear the honesty that hurt and still kept the power clean.

“I think she did the best version of truth,” I said. “The kind you can stand on.”

Charli’s eyes shone in the window reflection. She blinked and looked away before the tears could turn into a thing she had to manage.

A few moments passed.

Then she asked, so small it almost didn’t make it over the engine noise:

“Do you think I made it worse.”

I turned my head just enough to look at her properly.

“No,” I said, and it came out clean. “You made it visible.”

Her shoulders rose and fell, once. Like she’d been holding her breath since yesterday.

“I didn’t want to be… difficult,” she whispered.

There it was again—the learned apology for existing.

I kept my voice low. Not gentle the way you soothe a child. Gentle the way you speak to someone whose dignity matters.

“You weren’t being difficult,” I said. “You were being scared. And then you were being brave.”

Charli made a sound that might have been a laugh in another life. It died before it reached her mouth.

“I don’t feel brave.”

“Most people don’t,” I said. “They just… do the next thing.”

She stared out at the passing houses.

“What if I don’t know what I want,” she said.

The bus turned. Light shifted across her face like a moving hand.

“You don’t have to know the whole future,” I said. “You have to know the next true thing.”

Charli’s voice turned rough.

“All I know is what I don’t want.”

“That’s still knowledge,” I said. “And it’s useful.”

She nodded, tiny, then said it—flat, honest, unornamented:

“I don’t want to be called *sir*.”

I felt my jaw tighten, the reflex of anger at a world that could press a word into someone like a stamp.

“And I don’t want…” Her fingers knotted around the strap. “I don’t want *son*.”

There was a pause, and in it I heard what she didn’t say: *and I don’t know what that makes me.*

I didn’t push.

Instead I gave her the rope of something she could hold.

“Okay,” I said. “Then we don’t use those words.”

Charli’s shoulders lowered a fraction. Relief, not joy. Safety, not celebration.

Her gaze flicked sideways to me for the first time since we boarded. A quick look, like checking whether I meant it.

“You don’t mind,” she said, and the question was absurd in the way fear always makes questions absurd.

I kept my eyes forward. I didn’t want to turn this into a performance of reassurance.

“I mind the idea of you being hurt,” I said. “I don’t mind you.”

Charli’s breath caught. She looked away fast.

We rode another stop. Another.

And then she said, very quietly, “You didn’t come with us.”

It wasn’t accusation. It was noticing.

“I didn’t think I should,” I said.

She worried the strap again. “Why.”

Because I wanted to say: *Because Lauren needed that space. Because you needed your mother without me in the air, changing the temperature of every sentence.*

But what came out was simpler, truer.

“Because you deserved a conversation that wasn’t about me,” I said.

Charli’s fingers went still.

The bus’s lights flickered on as the day dimmed, and suddenly the windows held more reflection than view.

“I thought you hated me,” she said.

The sentence punched the breath out of my chest. Not because it was rational.

Because it proved how much she’d been reading my distance as judgement.

I turned toward her then. Fully. Not dramatic. Just honest.

“I don’t hate you,” I said.

She stared at the seat in front of her as if it might protect her from the look in my eyes.

“I kept my distance,” I went on, and my voice stayed controlled even as something in me softened. “Because you’re young. Because I didn’t want you to confuse structure with… attachment. And because I didn’t trust myself.”

Charli blinked fast.

“Why,” she whispered.

I should have kept it neat. I should have kept it safe.

But after last night, after today, after seeing how close she’d come to solving a terror with a bottle and a secret, neatness felt like cowardice.

So I gave her the truth in a form she could carry.

“Because from the beginning,” I said, “I noticed you.”

She looked at me, startled.

“Not the way men notice,” I added, because she needed that distinction like she needed air. “Not as a thing. As a person. As someone who was trying very hard to be good, and who kept thinking goodness would make her safe.”

Charli’s mouth trembled.

“I thought you were disappointed in me,” she said.

“No,” I said. “I was… careful.”

Her eyes filled. She didn’t wipe them away. She just let them sit there, bright and unspectacular.

“What did you think of me,” she asked, and the question was so vulnerable it hurt.

I held her gaze.

“I thought you were brave long before you ever believed you were,” I said. “And I thought you were lonely in a way you shouldn’t have had to be.”

Charli’s face crumpled slightly, then steadied, like she was learning how to let feeling exist without it becoming collapse.

The bus slowed for the next stop. Doors sighed open. People got off. The world continued to not care.

Charli wiped one cheek with the edge of her sleeve, quick and ashamed.

I didn’t comment on the tear.

I let it be what it was: evidence.

When the doors closed again, she spoke without looking at me.

“So,” she said, voice thin, “you don’t think I’m… pretending.”

There it was. The fear of being accused of theatre.

“No,” I said. “I think you’ve been surviving.”

A long exhale left her. Like she’d been holding her breath for months.

We rode the rest of the way with our shoulders not quite touching. Close enough to count as company. Far enough to count as respect.

And in that narrow distance, something new settled—not romance, not resolution.

A shared understanding that the next true thing could be done together.

✨ 33 Ending ✨

The bus hissed to a stop and the doors folded open.

We stood with the other passengers and filed out into the cooled evening air. The streetlights had come on while we were riding; their glow made the pavement look slightly unreal, like a set dressed to resemble ordinary life. Charli adjusted her tote strap and stepped down to the footpath, careful of her footing, careful of everything.

I let her take the first step away from the curb.

Not because I didn’t want to walk beside her.

Because I wanted her to feel—physically—that she wasn’t being guided like cargo. That she still owned her own legs.

We turned toward home. Our footsteps found a shared pace without either of us asking for it. For a few metres we walked in silence, the sort that didn’t ask to be filled. I could feel the residue of what she’d said still hanging around her like humidity: *sir*; *son*; the tight, stubborn knowledge of what she couldn’t bear.

At the corner she faltered—just a half-step, as if her body remembered fear before her mind did.

I didn’t reach for her hand.

I didn’t touch her shoulder.

I simply moved closer, closing the air between us until my presence could be felt without making a claim.

She glanced sideways at me, quick and searching, then looked ahead again.

We kept walking.

And I understood, with a calm that felt almost clinical, that whatever distance I’d been calling discipline was starting to look less like safety and more like absence. That if I kept standing back for the sake of being “proper,” all I would teach her was that care had to be earned.

The street was quiet. A porch light flicked on as we passed. Somewhere a kettle whistled in a house we couldn’t see.

Charli’s breath steadied. Her steps matched mine.

Home was only a few blocks away.

And for once, it didn’t feel like a place we were returning to.

It felt like a place we were about to begin.

Perfect — and since we *haven’t* pinned down car vs public transport, we can make that ambiguity work *for* you instead of against you. 😊🌿

### Quick decision (so you can write cleanly)

You’ve got two strong options, and both support the emotional intent:

**A) Public transport (bus/train)**

* Gives you **contained intimacy without “date vibe”**.
* Natural pauses (stops, announcements) let Celeste choose her words carefully.
* Charli can look out the window instead of being “on the spot,” which suits her.

**B) Shared car ride (Celeste drives)**

* More private, more intense.
* But it can read as “couple-coded” earlier than you want, unless you keep it matter-of-fact (rideshare, roster convenience).

Given you want *end-of-day, not-at-home yet, first heart-to-heart*, I’d pick **public transport**. It keeps Celeste’s restraint believable while still letting tenderness leak through.

Below is a full Scene 33 built around that. Lauren is present as an *echo* (not a participant), and Celeste’s feelings arrive in the right order: **respect → care → honesty**.

---

## Scene 33 — “Commute” (Celeste POV, past tense)

We left Wardrobe the way women leave a place that has held them all day: quietly, efficiently, without ceremony.

The workroom behind us was still full of breath—steam residue, starch, the faint sweetness of fabric warmed by irons—but the corridor outside had that cooler, emptied feel. End of day. Lights not yet dimmed, but already less intimate. The building exhaled.

Charli walked beside me with her tote hugged close to her hip. She’d been steady all afternoon—competent hands, quiet yeses—but there was a softness to her face now that read like aftermath. Not fragility exactly.

More like she was still holding herself together by habit.

I didn’t ask about the appointment. Not in the work corridor, not where anyone could come around a corner and hear a private thing turn into gossip by accident. And because I could still hear last night in my head: *Some things belong to mother and daughter alone.*

Outside, the air had cooled. We stood at the stop with two other commuters and a woman on her phone, and Charli kept her eyes on the road as if she could summon the bus by will.

When it arrived, we climbed aboard. I tapped on. Charli followed. We took the pair of seats near the back where the ride was smoother and fewer eyes lingered.

She sat by the window.

Of course she did.

For a while we said nothing. The bus rocked gently over patched bitumen. The city slid by in pieces: shopfronts, trees, a mechanic’s yard, a school oval gone gold in the late light. The ordinary world doing its ordinary thing, indifferent to the fact that inside this bus a seventeen-year-old had just walked out of a clinic holding a folded piece of paper that felt like a map out of the dark.

Charli smoothed the edge of her tote strap with her thumb. Again. Again.

I watched her hands because watching her face felt like asking too much of her.

After three stops she spoke, still looking out the window.

“She didn’t say much,” she said.

I didn’t pretend not to know who she meant.

“Lauren,” I said quietly.

Charli nodded once.

“She was… steady,” she added, like it surprised her. Like she’d expected anger or humiliation or punishment and had instead found a mother who did something much harder: held the line and stayed.

I felt something ease in my chest.

“Your mum’s good at being an adult,” I said. “Even when it hurts.”

Charli’s throat moved. She swallowed.

“She looked at me like…” She stopped. Started again. “Like she was trying to see me properly.”

The words landed softly, and the ache in them was sharp.

“Yes,” I said. “That’s what she was doing.”

Charli’s fingers tightened on the tote strap.

“And she…” Her voice got thinner. “She said she could learn.”

I glanced at her, careful.

“That’s not nothing,” I said.

“No.” Another swallow. “It’s just… the way she said it. Like she didn’t hate it, but… she didn’t—” Charli’s breath hitched, frustrated by her own lack of language. “It’s new in her mouth.”

I could hear Lauren saying it. Could hear the honesty that hurt and still kept the power clean.

“I think she did the best version of truth,” I said. “The kind you can stand on.”

Charli’s eyes shone in the window reflection. She blinked and looked away before the tears could turn into a thing she had to manage.

A few moments passed.

Then she asked, so small it almost didn’t make it over the engine noise:

“Do you think I made it worse.”

“No,” I said, and it came out clean. “You made it visible.”

Her shoulders rose and fell, once. Like she’d been holding her breath since yesterday.

“I didn’t want to be… difficult,” she whispered.

There it was again—the learned apology for existing.

I kept my voice low. Not gentle the way you soothe a child. Gentle the way you speak to someone whose dignity matters.

“You weren’t being difficult,” I said. “You were being scared. And then you were being brave.”

Charli made a sound that might have been a laugh in another life. It died before it reached her mouth.

“I don’t feel brave.”

“Most people don’t,” I said. “They just… do the next thing.”

She stared out at the passing houses.

“What if I don’t know what I want,” she said.

The bus turned. Light shifted across her face like a moving hand.

“You don’t have to know the whole future,” I said. “You have to know the next true thing.”

Charli’s voice turned rough.

“All I know is what I don’t want.”

“That’s still knowledge,” I said. “And it’s useful.”

She nodded, tiny, then said it—flat, honest, unornamented:

“I don’t want to be called *sir*.”

I felt my jaw tighten, the reflex of anger at a world that could press a word into someone like a stamp.

“And I don’t want…” Her fingers knotted around the strap. “I don’t want *son*.”

There was a pause, and in it I heard what she didn’t say: *and I don’t know what that makes me.*

I didn’t push.

Instead I gave her the rope of something she could hold.

“Okay,” I said. “Then we don’t use those words.”

Charli’s shoulders lowered a fraction. Relief, not joy. Safety, not celebration.

Her gaze flicked sideways to me for the first time since we boarded. A quick look, like checking whether I meant it.

“You don’t mind,” she said, and the question was absurd in the way fear always makes questions absurd.

I kept my eyes forward. I didn’t want to turn this into a performance of reassurance.

“I mind the idea of you being hurt,” I said. “I don’t mind you.”

Charli’s breath caught. She looked away fast.

We rode another stop. Another.

And then she said, very quietly, “You didn’t come with us.”

It wasn’t accusation. It was noticing.

“I didn’t think I should,” I said.

But what came out was simpler, truer.

“Because you deserved a conversation that wasn’t about me,” I said.

Charli’s fingers went still.

The bus’s lights flickered on as the day dimmed, and suddenly the windows held more reflection than view.

“I thought you hated me,” she said.

The sentence punched the breath out of my chest. Not because it was rational.

Because it proved how much she’d been reading my distance as judgement.

I turned toward her then. Fully. Not dramatic. Just honest.

“I don’t hate you,” I said.

She stared at the seat in front of her as if it might protect her from the look in my eyes.

“I kept my distance,” I went on, and my voice stayed controlled even as something in me softened. “Because you’re young. Because I didn’t want you to confuse structure with… attachment. And because I didn’t trust myself.”

Charli blinked fast.

“Why,” she whispered.

I should have kept it neat. I should have kept it safe.

But after last night, after today, after seeing how close she’d come to solving a terror with a bottle and a secret, neatness felt like cowardice.

So I gave her the truth in a form she could carry.

“Because from the beginning,” I said, “I noticed you.”

She looked at me, startled.

“Not the way men notice,” I added, because she needed that distinction like she needed air. “Not as a thing. As a person. As someone who was trying very hard to be good, and who kept thinking goodness would make her safe.”

Charli’s mouth trembled.

“I thought you were disappointed in me,” she said.

“No,” I said. “I was… careful.”

Her eyes filled. She didn’t wipe them away. She just let them sit there, bright and unspectacular.

“What did you think of me,” she asked, and the question was so vulnerable it hurt.

I held her gaze.

“I thought you were brave long before you ever believed you were,” I said. “And I thought you were lonely in a way you shouldn’t have had to be.”

Charli’s face crumpled slightly, then steadied, like she was learning how to let feeling exist without it becoming collapse.

The bus slowed for the next stop. Doors sighed open. People got off. The world continued to not care.

Charli wiped one cheek with the edge of her sleeve, quick and ashamed.

I didn’t comment on the tear.

I let it be what it was: evidence.

When the doors closed again, she spoke without looking at me.

“So,” she said, voice thin, “you don’t think I’m… pretending.”

There it was. The fear of being accused of theatre.

“No,” I said. “I think you’ve been surviving.”

A long exhale left her. Like she’d been holding her breath for months.

We rode the rest of the way with our shoulders not quite touching. Close enough to count as company. Far enough to count as respect.

And in that narrow distance, something new settled—not romance, not resolution.

A shared understanding that the next true thing could be done together.

If you’d like, I can also write the **very last paragraph** of Scene 33 as they step off the bus and walk toward home (where the “heart-to-heart at home” can begin next scene), with Celeste feeling that *distance thinning* again — but keeping it austere, restrained, and real.

Absolutely. Here’s a grounded, austere closing beat — stepping off the bus, walking toward home, the “distance” thinning without turning into a warm bow. 🌿🖤

The bus hissed to a stop and the doors folded open.

We stood with the other passengers and filed out into the cooled evening air.
