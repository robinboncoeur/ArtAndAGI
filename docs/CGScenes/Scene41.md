**Scene 41 — “The Weight of Orders” (Lauren POV, past tense)**

--

Wardrobe had always been busy in the way a good kitchen was busy—productive noise, purposeful movement, women speaking in shorthand because competence didn’t need speeches.

But this week was different.

This week the workroom had a *weight*.

The first big order arrived in an email that read like a dream: a new Faire setting up between Brisbane and the Gold Coast—bright-eyed, ambitious, themed around **Les Misérables**, and hungry for authenticity.

Not the usual tidy eighteenth-century silhouettes that Wardrobe could draft in its sleep.

This was nineteenth-century France: layers and hardship and seams that were meant to look lived-in. And the organisers had been polite about Queensland’s climate, too—lighter materials, breathable choices, costumes that wouldn’t turn performers into boiled prawns.

Celeste had been delighted.

Mara had been interested.

Bree had made a face and said, “Finally. Something that lets people sweat *for art*.”

Sarah had smiled like a woman who could smell challenge the way other people smelled bread.

Lauren had watched all of it—watched the women lean forward, hungry and capable—and felt something in her chest lift with pride that was still new enough to surprise her.

They could do it. Of course they could.

Then the organiser revealed the number.

The room didn’t go silent. That wasn’t Wardrobe’s style. But a particular kind of stillness settled, like every woman in the building had done the same calculation at once.

It wasn’t impossible.

It was just… a lot.

The kind of lot that changed how you breathed.

Lauren’s hands had stayed steady on her clipboard as if her body didn’t know her life was rearranging itself by the hour. She moved through the workroom, collecting fabric quotes, noting quantities, listening to Celeste’s quiet directives—this, then this, then this—like a captain mapping a storm.

And all the while, Lauren felt the other storm pressing at the edge of her mind, waiting for a gap.

Roger.

It was almost laughable, how long she’d managed to hold him at bay by staying too busy to feel anything properly.

But busyness had limits. So did denial.

That afternoon, when she finally went home, the air in her house felt wrong—too empty, too staged, like a hotel room someone had tried to make look lived in.

Roger’s shoes were by the door. His keys were in the bowl. His scent—aftershave and entitlement—hung in the hallway as if it owned the place.

Lauren’s stomach tightened.

She didn’t go to the kitchen first. She didn’t tidy. She didn’t do any of her old rituals that had served as delay tactics for years.

She went straight to the study.

Roger was there, leaning back in his chair, phone in hand, smiling at something on the screen like a man who had never once feared consequence.

He looked up as if he’d been expecting her. Not with warmth. With calculation.

“Hey,” he said.

Lauren heard her own voice come out calm.

“I know.”

His smile faltered. Then returned, thinner. “Know what?”

Lauren placed her handbag on the desk with care. Not because she cared about the bag. Because she was anchoring herself to something physical.

“The messages,” she said. “The hotel receipts. The lies that don’t even bother trying anymore.”

Roger’s expression did a small, practiced shift into indignation.

“You went through my—”

“Don’t,” Lauren said.

The single word stopped him. It surprised her, how cleanly it came out. Like Celeste had lent her a spine.

Roger stared at her for a moment, then tried a different tack—the one that used to work.

“You’re tired,” he said. “You’ve been working too much. You’re letting those women get in your head.”

Lauren blinked slowly.

She realised, with a clarity that almost made her laugh, that he was still speaking to the old version of her: the one who needed him. The one who had stayed because she couldn’t see a way out.

She could see it now.

And it was woman-shaped.

“No,” she said. “I’m letting myself get in my head. For the first time in years.”

Roger’s jaw tightened. “So what, you’re leaving?”

Lauren paused.

It was a strange moment—standing in her own house, looking at the man she’d built a life around, and feeling… nothing tender. Just a kind of tired, lucid sadness.

“I’m asking you to,” she said. “Tonight.”

Roger’s eyes widened, genuinely offended.

“You can’t be serious.”

Lauren surprised herself again.

“I’m financially independent,” she said. “I don’t need you to survive.”

She watched that land. Watched the way his face changed—not grief, not remorse—just anger at losing a convenience.

“You ungrateful—” he started.

Lauren lifted her hand.

“Don’t,” she said again, and the second time it wasn’t borrowed strength. It was hers.

Roger stood so suddenly his chair scraped the floor.

“You think you’re better than me now?” he snapped. “Because you’ve got some little women’s club and a job playing dress-ups?”

Lauren’s throat tightened.

Not because the words hurt, exactly.

Because they were so revealing.

She thought of Wardrobe: the racks, the pattern paper, the girls’ hands moving with skill. Celeste’s quiet authority. Sarah’s sharp honesty. The way Charli had begun, slowly, to exist without flinching.

Dress-ups.

That was what he thought women’s labour was.

Lauren’s face warmed with something that felt like rage and grief braided together.

“No,” she said. “I think I’m *awake*.”

Roger stepped closer. His voice dropped into that intimate threat men used when they wanted you to remember you were smaller.

“You’re making a mistake.”

Lauren didn’t step back.

“I’m correcting one,” she said.

He stared at her, breathing hard, then turned away with a violent gesture as if the room itself offended him.

“You’ll regret this,” he said.

It was almost a script line.

Lauren felt her hands begin to shake only after he slammed the study door on his way out.

She stood there, alone, in the strange quiet, and realised she was both terrified and… free.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket.

A message from Sarah.

**You okay?**

Lauren’s eyes stung.

She hadn’t told Sarah anything specific. Not yet. But Sarah—infuriatingly perceptive—had noticed the way Lauren’s smile had been too careful all day.

Lauren’s fingers hovered over the keyboard. She tried to type *I’m fine* and couldn’t.

Instead, she wrote: **No.**

The reply came instantly, as if Sarah had been waiting with the phone in her hand.

**Right. Come to mine. Now.**

Lauren sat down on the edge of the chair Roger had abandoned, and something in her chest tightened so hard it felt like she couldn’t breathe.

Sarah’s flat certainty shouldn’t have made her cry.

It did anyway.

Lauren typed: **I can’t.**

A beat.

Then:

**Because you’re proud? Or because you’re scared?**

Lauren stared at the screen.

Her fingers went cold.

She hadn’t said it. Not to anyone. Not out loud.

But the true answer rose immediately, humiliating in its honesty:

Because she had feelings for Sarah.

Because she had, at some point she couldn’t locate, started wanting Sarah’s attention the way you wanted warmth when you’d been cold for too long—quietly, desperately, and with a kind of shame that didn’t belong to her.

Because she was certain Sarah could never want her back.

Sarah was fire. Sarah was sharp. Sarah was the sort of woman who looked like she’d never needed anyone.

Lauren was… Lauren. Middle-aged. Careful. A woman who had stayed too long and was only now learning how to leave.

She typed with shaking thumbs:

**I don’t think you understand.**

Sarah’s reply took slightly longer this time. Not long—just long enough for Lauren to picture Sarah on her bed, phone in hand, face thoughtful in a way she didn’t show at work.

Then it arrived.

**I understand plenty. I’m not asking you for a confession. I’m offering you a door that locks.**

Lauren swallowed.

From the other room came the sound of Roger moving—drawers opening, something thrown, the heavy-footed performance of a man making sure she heard his anger.

Lauren’s body flinched before her mind could.

And that, more than anything, decided it.

She typed:

**Okay.**

A final message came back, firm as a hand at her elbow.

**Good. Bring nothing you can’t live without. I’ll make tea.**

Lauren stared at the words.

Tea.

Such an ordinary promise.

Such an enormous mercy.

She stood, wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand, and went to the bedroom to pack with the quiet efficiency of a woman who had finally stopped asking permission.

At the front door, she hesitated—one last, stupid reflex of loyalty toward a life that hadn’t been loyal to her.

Then she opened it.

Outside, the evening air was warm and alive. Somewhere a neighbour’s sprinkler hissed. A bird called from a powerline as if gossiping about the whole street.

Lauren stepped out.

And for the first time that day, she felt the faintest hint of peace—not because everything was resolved, but because she was moving toward women who would not let her face it alone.
