**Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.

**Scene 53 — “The Ask” (Celeste POV, 1st person, past tense)**

By the time the final bolt of navy wool came off the cutting table, I could measure time in coats.

There was the week of toiles and swearing, when the Les Mis patterns looked elegant on paper and like sackcloth on actual bodies. The fortnight of re-drafting sleeve heads because Queensland men apparently had shoulders like door frames. The quiet, obsessive days of hand-stitching facings while the rain came down in sheets outside and the irons hissed like they were helping.

And then, slowly, rails filled.

Every morning I came in and Wardrobe smelled of steam and soap and fabric dust. Sarah had a permanent chalk bloom on one thigh from bracing patterns there. Charli had thread on her fingers more often than not, little pale crescents where she’d jabbed herself and kept going. Mara’s spreadsheet swore in more colours than I thought Excel capable of.

Three months after the loading bay incident, the ghosts of that day were still there—but softer. Integrated. Like bruises that had stopped aching and gone yellow.

Charli could stand in the loading bay now without going glassy. I watched it happen the first time: a courier too close, his arm brushing her shoulder, that first flicker of old panic in her eyes… and then the tiny, visible click as she remembered.

“Could you step back a bit, please?” she’d said. Clear. Polite. Not apologetic.

He had. No fuss. No scene. She’d brought the clipboard inside with hands that only shook a little, and later that night on the couch she’d said, “I did the thing,” and I’d known exactly which thing she meant.

We were not healed—this wasn’t that kind of story—but we were… practising. Building scar tissue into something like strength.

Sarah and Lauren were practising too. The first month after Roger had been all edges and jumps, Lauren sleeping like a soldier waiting for an alarm. By the second, there were mornings when I walked into the kitchen to find them half-dancing around each other for bench space, hip against hip, complaining about toast crumbs and not the past. Sarah still refused to call it anything, but the way her hand lingered on Lauren’s back when she thought no one was looking had its own vocabulary.

So when the call came from Queensland, it landed in a Wardrobe that was—by our standards—almost steady.

I was at the big table, marking button placements on the last of the municipal guard coats. The navy cloth was thick under my fingers; the linen interlining gave it a decent chance of surviving both heat and male carelessness. Mara was at her laptop, swearing in French at a freight form.

My phone buzzed on the table.

Unknown number, Queensland area code.

“Joy,” I muttered, wiping a dot of tailor’s chalk off the screen with the side of my thumb. “Here we go.”

“Answer it,” Mara said without looking up. “If it is idiot, I wish to know which idiot.”

I put it on speaker and hit accept.

“Celeste speaking.”

A woman’s voice came down the line, brisk and warm with that particular coastal Queensland lilt that made every sentence sound half-sunburnt.

“Hi, Celeste, it’s Fiona Cole from the Queensland Historical Experience—your people did our contract, we’ve been emailing? Do you have a minute?”

“Sure,” I said. “You’re on speaker with me and Mara, our head of Wardrobe. We’re in the workroom.”

“Perfect,” she said. “Then I’ll keep it short because you probably have a needle in your hand.”

I could practically hear her looking at a clipboard. Paper rustled.

“First off, thank you,” she said. “The sample pieces you sent up? Stunning. Our director actually used the phrase ‘properly dressed humans’ in the last meeting, which is a first.”

Mara made a small, pleased noise that in any other woman would have counted as a squeal.

“That is good to hear,” she said.

“Second,” Fiona went on, “we’ve got confirmation on our opening dates. Site’s coming together, actors are being cast, and your shipment schedule fits beautifully, so no panic there.”

“That’s what all this swearing is for,” Mara murmured.

“But,” Fiona said, and there it was—the hinge in her tone—“we’ve hit a small… reality problem.”

I underlined the next button mark a little too hard.

“Define ‘reality problem’,” I said.

“Well.” She blew out a breath that fuzzed the line. “We are, as you know, building our own in-house Wardrobe up here. On paper, I have a team. In reality, I have three enthusiastic twenty-somethings who are very good at TikTok and… let’s call it ‘developing’ in the corsetry department.”

I could feel Mara stiffen across the table.

“They’re not incompetent,” Fiona hurried on. “They’re just green. And your brief has more layers than the costumes—maintenance, fit, ongoing alterations, training casuals, dealing with tourists who spill coffee on things… it’s a lot to expect of people who’ve never hemmed anything thicker than a school skirt.”

“So you would like more people,” Mara said, voice going flat in that way that meant she was already doing maths in her head.

“I would like,” Fiona said carefully, “to not destroy five years of your work in the first fortnight because we staffed our Wardrobe with vibes and vibes alone.”

I couldn’t help it; I liked her.

“What are you asking for, exactly?” I said.

“A short-term deployment,” she said. “A few of your experienced people up here for, say, the first month? To help set up our systems, train my team, troubleshoot… tell us when we’re being idiots before we order the wrong thread by the kilometre.”

She paused.

“I know it’s a big ask,” she added. “We’d cover flights, accommodation, per diems. We can pay a consulting fee. But what we can’t magic up, apparently, is your brain and your standards. So we’re hoping you might loan us some of that, temporarily.”

The room went quiet, except for the tick of the ceiling fan.

A month.

A month without Charli in my bed. A month without Sarah at the far worktable muttering about seam allowances. A month with my two finest women dropped into a half-built male-coded circus where the power structures were not ours.

My chest tightened so fast it was almost funny.

Mara was watching me, eyes narrow, like she could see the whole emotional calculus unrolling behind my face.

“Who do you need?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

“Honestly?” Fiona said. “Whoever you think represents you best in the room. We’ll take who we can get. But if I’m dreaming big… someone who understands outerwear and fittings, and someone who’s lived in the clothes. The way the garments move on an actual working body? We can’t learn that from email.”

Of course.

Sarah and Charli. The combination I would choose myself, if I could detach my heart from my head.

“Right,” I said slowly. “Okay. Let me talk to my people and check what we can manage. When would you need them?”

“Crates land here mid-month, right?” Fiona said. “If we could have them on site a few days before that, to receive stock and set up, that would be… ideal. But I know that’s like asking the moon to move its orbit. Just… let me know what’s possible.”

“Understood,” I said. “We’ll get back to you within the week.”

“Brilliant. And Celeste?”

“Yes?”

“I really mean it,” she said, voice softening. “We want to get this right. We didn’t bring you on to turn your work into theme-park tat. If sending us your best for a bit is what it takes to honour what you’ve built, I’m prepared to fight for that budget.”

Something in me unclenched by a hair.

“Good to hear,” I said. “We’ll be in touch.”

We hung up.

The workroom hummed for a moment with the absence of her voice.

Mara was the first to break it.

“You are going to send Sarah and Charli,” she said. Not a question.

My mouth opened. Closed.

“They are the obvious choice,” I said.

“They are the only choice,” Mara corrected gently. “Lauren is not leaving Queensland again so soon. I am needed here. The others are too new. Sarah can hold a room of men by the throat with one eyebrow. And Charli—”

“She knows the clothes from the inside,” I finished. “And the QLD team needs to see what the work *looks like* in motion.”

“And,” Mara added, even softer, “Charli needs to experience being competent and safe in a place that is not here.”

I stared at the navy wool under my hands.

The thought of Charli on that site—heat, dust, strangers, all that unstructured male energy—made every protective instinct in me roar. The idea of sleeping without the quiet weight of her hand curled in my T-shirt made my stomach turn over.

“You are not sending her into war,” Mara said, watching my face. “You are sending her with Sarah. With a clear brief. With permission to call you and say ‘enough’. This is not Nigel packing bags and announcing decisions. This is you asking and trusting.”

“I know,” I said. The words scraped on the way out. “I just… don’t like the part where trust feels like tearing.”

Mara’s mouth quirked.

“Welcome to leadership,” she said. “It is mostly a series of elegant heartbreaks for a good cause.”

I let out a breath that was almost a laugh.

“I have to give them the choice,” I said. “Both of them. Not a fait accompli.”

“Of course,” Mara said. “You will tell Sarah in four sentences and she will agree in three. Charli will try to say no because she does not want to leave you. You will have to convince her that wanting to go and wanting to stay can exist in the same heart.”

“I hate it when you’re right,” I muttered.

“You are only saying that because I am right,” she replied.

I set the tailor’s chalk down and flexed my sore fingers.

“Okay,” I said. “We finish this coat. We eat something that is not chocolate. And tonight, I talk to Sarah. Tomorrow… Charli.”

The words sat in my chest like a stone and like a promise, both at once.

Outside, a courier van rattled past the front window, heading somewhere else with someone else’s parcels. Inside, Wardrobe kept moving: scissors, steam, the low murmur of women doing work that deserved to arrive in Queensland with someone there to explain it properly.

I picked up my chalk and marked the next button.

One decision at a time.

🧳 A Big Ask 🧳

[ Celeste ]

By the time the final bolt of navy wool came off the cutting table, I could measure time in coats.

There was the week of toiles and swearing, when the Les Mis patterns looked elegant on paper and like sackcloth on actual bodies. The fortnight of re-drafting sleeve heads because Queensland men apparently had shoulders like door frames.

Mara’s spreadsheet swore in more colours than I thought Google Sheets capable of.

Three months after the loading bay incident, the ghosts of that day were still there—but softer. Integrated. Like bruises that had stopped aching and gone yellow.

Charli could stand in the loading bay to accept deliveries now without going glassy. I watched it happen the first time: a courier too close, his arm brushing her shoulder, that first flicker of old panic in her eyes… and then the tiny, visible click as she remembered.

“Could I get you to step back a bit, please?” she’d said. Clear. Polite. Not apologetic.

He had. No fuss. No scene. She’d brought the clipboard inside with hands that only shook a little, and later that night on the couch she’d said, “I did the thing,” and I’d known exactly which thing she meant.

We were not healed, but definitely *healing*. I saw a new trust in her eyes, one that grew slowly but certainly through constant practising. 

Sarah and Lauren were practising too. The first month after Roger had been all edges and jumps, Lauren sleeping like a soldier waiting for an alarm. By the second, there were mornings when I walked into the kitchen to find them half-dancing around each other for bench space, hip against hip, complaining about toast crumbs and not the past.

I was at the big table, marking button placements on the last of the municipal guard coats. The navy cloth was thick under my fingers; the linen interlining gave it a decent chance of surviving both heat and male carelessness. Mara was at her laptop, swearing at a freight form. The ledger had finally been retired, but not with some resistance. It was the fact that the work she did could easily be shared between us that finally convinced her.

My phone buzzed on the table.

Unknown number, Queensland area code.

“Joy,” I muttered, wiping a dot of tailor’s chalk off the screen with the side of my thumb. “Here we go.”

“Answer it,” Mara said without looking up. “If it is an idiot, I want to know which idiot.”

“Sure,” I said. “You’re on speaker with me and Mara, our head of Wardrobe.”

“Perfect,” she said. “Then I’ll keep it short because you probably have needles to tend to.”

I could practically hear her looking at a clipboard. Paper rustled.

“First off, thank you,” she said. “The sample pieces you sent up? Stunning. Our director actually used the phrase ‘properly dressed humans’ in the last meeting, which is a first.”

Mara made a small, pleased noise that in any other woman would have counted as a squeal.

“So you would like more people,” Mara said, voice going flat in that way that meant she was already doing maths in her head.

“I would like,” Fiona said carefully, “to not destroy five years of costume development and exquisite artisanal work in the first fortnight because we staffed our Wardrobe with vibes and good intentions.”

I couldn’t help it; I liked her.

“What are you asking for, exactly?” I said.

“A short-term deployment,” she said. “A few of your experienced people up here for, say, the first month? To help set up our systems, train my team, troubleshoot… tell us when we’re being idiots before we order the wrong thread by the kilometre.”

The room went quiet, except for the tick of the ceiling fan.

I’d already decided who I was going to send before she was even half-way done speaking, and then—timeframe.

A month.

A month without Charli in my bed.

A month without Sarah at the far worktable muttering about seam allowances. A month with my two finest women dropped into a half-built male-coded circus where the power structures were not ours.

My chest tightened so fast I had to wince.

Mara was watching me, eyes narrow, like she could see the whole emotional calculus unrolling behind my face.

“Who do you need?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

“Honestly?” Fiona said. “Whoever you think represents you best in the room. I mean, we’ll take who we can get. But if I’m dreaming big… someone who understands outerwear and fittings, and someone who’s lived in the clothes. The way the garments move on an actual working body? We can’t learn that from email.”

Of course.

It could only be Sarah and Charli, the combination I could confidently choose myself, if I could detach my heart from my head.

“Right,” I said slowly. “Okay. Let me talk to my people and see what we can manage. By when would you need them?”

“Crates land here mid-month, right?” Fiona said. “If we could have them on site a few days before that, to receive stock and set up, that would be… ideal. But I know that’s like asking the moon to move its orbit. Just… let me know what’s possible.”

My mouth opened. Closed.

“They are the obvious choice,” I said.

“They are the only choice,” Mara corrected gently. “Lauren is not leaving Queensland again so soon—she's got that legal mess to sort. I am needed here. The others are too new. Sarah can hold a room of men by the throat with one eyebrow. And Charli—”

“She knows the clothes from the inside,” I finished. “She could teach the physics. And the QLD team needs to see what the work *acts like* in motion.”

“And,” Mara added, even softer, “Charli needs to experience being competent and safe in a place that is not here, with us.”

I stared at the navy wool under my hands.

The thought of Charli on that site—heat, dust, strangers, all that unstructured male energy—made every protective instinct in me roar. The idea of sleeping without the quiet weight of her hand curled in my T-shirt made my stomach turn over.

“You are not sending her into war,” Mara said, watching my face. “You are sending her with Sarah. With a clear brief. With permission to call you and say ‘enough’. This is not you coldly announcing decisions. This is you asking and her trusting.”

“I know,” I said. The words scraped on the way out. “I just… don’t like the part where asking her to trust feels like tearing into a wound.”

Mara’s mouth quirked.

“Welcome to leadership,” she said. “It is mostly a series of elegant heartbreaks for a good cause.”

I let out a breath that was almost a laugh.

“I have to give them the choice,” I said. “Both of them. Not a fait accompli.”

“Okay,” I said. “We finish this coat. We eat something that is not chocolate. And tonight, I talk to Sarah. Tomorrow… Charli.”

“No, you order Thai takeaway, and have a talk to both of them over lunch. Waiting isn't going to make this easier, Celeste.”

She was right, of course. I picked my phone.

Outside, a courier van rattled past the front window, heading somewhere else with someone else’s parcels. Inside, Wardrobe kept moving: scissors, steam, the low murmur of women doing work that deserved to arrive in Queensland with someone there to explain it properly.

I tapped the Thai takeaway number I had on speed-dial.

One decision at a time.

🧳 A Big Ask 🧳

[ Celeste ]

By the time the final bolt of navy wool came off the cutting table, I measured time in coats.

There had been the week of toiles and swearing, when the Les Mis patterns looked elegant on paper and like sackcloth on actual bodies. The fortnight of re-drafting sleeve heads because Queensland men apparently had shoulders like door frames. The quiet, obsessive days of hand-stitching facings while the rain came down in sheets outside and the irons hissed their disapproval.

And then, slowly, the rails filled.

Every morning I came in, Wardrobe smelled of steam and soap and fabric dust. Sarah had a permanent chalk bloom on one thigh from bracing patterns there. Charli had thread on her fingers more often than not, little pale crescents where she’d jabbed herself and kept going. Mara’s spreadsheet swore in more colours than I’d realised Google Sheets could manage.

Three months after the loading bay incident, the ghosts of that day were still there—but softer. Integrated. Like bruises that had stopped aching and gone yellow.

Charli could stand in the loading bay to accept deliveries now without going glassy. I watched the first time it happened: a courier too close, his arm brushing her shoulder, that flicker of old panic in her eyes… and then the tiny, visible click as she remembered.

“Could I get you to step back a bit, please?” she’d said. Clear. Polite. Not apologetic.

He had. No fuss. No scene. She’d brought the clipboard inside with hands that only shook a little, and later that night on the couch she’d said, “I did the thing,” and I’d known exactly which thing she meant.

We were not healed, but we were definitely *healing*. I saw a new trust in her eyes, one that grew slowly but surely through constant practice.

Sarah and Lauren were practising too. The first month after Roger had been all edges and jumps, Lauren sleeping like a soldier waiting for an alarm. By the second, there were mornings when I walked into the kitchen to find them half-dancing around each other for bench space, hip against hip, complaining about toast crumbs and not the past. Sarah still refused to call it anything, but the way her hand lingered on Lauren’s back when she thought no one was looking had its own vocabulary.

So when the call came from Queensland, it landed in a Wardrobe that was—by our standards—almost steady.

I was at the big table, marking button placements on the last of the municipal guard coats. The navy cloth was thick under my fingers; the linen interlining gave it a decent chance of surviving both heat and male carelessness. Mara was at her laptop, swearing at a freight form. The ledger had finally been retired, albeit with resistance; realising its work could be shared between us had finally convinced her.

My phone buzzed on the table.

Unknown number, Queensland area code.

“Joy,” I muttered, wiping a dot of tailor’s chalk off the screen with the side of my thumb. “Here we go.”

“Answer it,” Mara said without looking up. “If it is an idiot, I want to know which idiot.”

I put it on speaker and hit accept.

“Celeste speaking.”

A woman’s voice came down the line, brisk and warm with that particular coastal Queensland lilt that made every sentence sound half-sunburnt.

“Hi, Celeste, it’s Fiona Cole from the Queensland Historical Experience—your people did our contract, we’ve been emailing? Do you have a minute?”

“Sure,” I said. “You’re on speaker with me and Mara, our head of Wardrobe.”

“Perfect,” she said. “Then I’ll keep it short because you probably have needles to tend to.”

I could practically hear her looking at a clipboard. Paper rustled.

“First off, thank you,” she said. “The sample pieces you sent up? Stunning. Our director actually used the phrase ‘properly dressed humans’ in the last meeting, which is a first.”

Mara made a small, pleased noise that in any other woman would have counted as a squeal.

“That is good to hear,” she said.

“Second,” Fiona went on, “we’ve got confirmation on our opening dates. Our site’s coming together, actors are being cast, and your shipment schedule fits beautifully, so no panic there.”

“That’s what all this swearing is for,” Mara murmured.

“But,” Fiona said, and there it was—the hinge in her tone—“we’ve hit a small… reality problem.”

I underlined the next button mark a little too hard.

“Define ‘reality problem’,” I said.

“Well.” She blew out a breath that fuzzed the line. “We are, as you know, building our own in-house Wardrobe up here. On paper, I have a team. In reality, I have three enthusiastic twenty-somethings who are very good at TikTok and… let’s call it ‘developing’ in the corsetry department.”

I felt Mara stiffen across the table.

“They’re not incompetent,” Fiona hurried on. “They’re just green. And your brief has more layers than the costumes—maintenance, fit, ongoing alterations, training casuals, dealing with tourists who spill coffee on things… it’s a lot to expect of people who’ve never hemmed anything thicker than a school skirt.”

“So you would like more people,” Mara said, voice going flat in that way that meant she was already doing maths in her head.

“I would like,” Fiona said carefully, “to not destroy five years of costume development and exquisite artisanal work in the first fortnight because we staffed our Wardrobe with vibes and good intentions.”

I couldn’t help it; I liked her.

“What are you asking for, exactly?” I said.

“A short-term deployment,” she said. “A few of your experienced people up here for, say, the first month? To help set up our systems, train my team, troubleshoot… tell us when we’re being idiots before we order the wrong thread by the kilometre.”

She paused.

“I know it’s a big ask,” she added. “We’d cover flights, accommodation, per diems. We can pay a consulting fee. But what we can’t magic up, apparently, is your brain and your standards. So we’re hoping you might loan us some of that, temporarily.”

The room went quiet, except for the tick of the ceiling fan.

I’d already decided who I was going to send before she was even half-way done speaking, and then—timeframe.

A month.

A month without Charli in my bed.

A month without Sarah at the far worktable muttering about seam allowances. A month with my two finest women dropped into a half-built male-coded circus where the power structures were not ours.

My chest tightened so fast I actually winced.

Mara was watching me, eyes narrow, like she could see the whole emotional calculus unrolling behind my face.

“Who do you need?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

“Honestly?” Fiona said. “Whoever you think represents you best in the room. I mean, we’ll take who we can get. But if I’m dreaming big… someone who understands outerwear and fittings, and someone who’s lived in the clothes. The way the garments move on an actual working body? We can’t learn that from email.”

Of course.

It could only be Sarah and Charli, the combination I could confidently choose myself, if I could detach my heart from my head.

“Right,” I said slowly. “Okay. Let me talk to my people and see what we can manage. By when would you need them?”

“Crates land here mid-month, right?” Fiona said. “If we could have them on site a few days before that, to receive stock and set up, that would be… ideal. But I know that’s like asking the moon to move its orbit. Just… let me know what’s possible.”

“Understood,” I said. “We’ll get back to you within the week.”

“Brilliant. And Celeste?”

“Yes?”

“I really mean it,” she said, voice softening. “We want to get this right. We didn’t bring you on to turn your work into theme-park tat. If sending us your best for a bit is what it takes to honour what you’ve built, I’m prepared to fight for that budget.”

Something in me unclenched by a hair.

“Good to hear,” I said. “We’ll be in touch.”

We hung up.

The workroom hummed for a moment with the absence of her voice.

Mara was the first to break it.

“You *are* going to send Sarah and Charli,” she said. Not a question.

My mouth opened. Closed.

“They are the obvious choice,” I said.

“They are the only choice,” Mara corrected gently. “Lauren can’t go to Queensland—she’s got that legal mess to sort. I am needed here. The others are too new. Sarah can hold a room of men by the throat with one eyebrow. And Charli—”

“She knows the clothes from the inside,” I finished. “She could teach the physics. And the QLD team needs to see what the work *acts like* in motion.”

“And,” Mara added, even softer, “Charli needs to experience being competent and safe in a place that is not here, with us.”

I stared at the navy wool under my hands.

The thought of Charli on that site—heat, dust, strangers, all that unstructured male energy—made every protective instinct in me roar. The idea of sleeping without the quiet weight of her hand curled in my T-shirt made my stomach turn over.

“You are not sending her into war,” Mara said, watching my face. “You are sending her with Sarah. With a clear brief. With permission to call you and say ‘enough’. This is not you coldly announcing decisions. This is you asking, and her trusting.”

“I know,” I said. The words scraped on the way out. “I just… don’t like the part where asking her to trust feels like tearing into a wound.”

Mara’s mouth quirked.

“Welcome to leadership,” she said. “It is mostly a series of elegant heartbreaks for a good cause.”

I let out a breath that was almost a laugh.

“I have to give them the choice,” I said. “Both of them. Not a *fait accompli*.”

“Of course,” Mara said. “You will tell Sarah in four sentences and she will agree in three. Charli will try to say no because she does not want to leave you. You will have to convince her that wanting to go and wanting to stay can exist in the same heart.”

“I hate it when you’re right,” I muttered.

“You are only saying that because I am right,” she replied.

I set the tailor’s chalk down and flexed my sore fingers.

“Okay,” I said. “We finish this coat. We eat something that is not chocolate. And tonight, I talk to Sarah. Tomorrow… Charli.”

“No,” Mara said calmly. “You order Thai takeaway, and you talk to both of them over lunch. Waiting is not going to make this easier, Celeste.”

She was right, of course. I picked up my phone.

Outside, a courier van rattled past the front window, heading somewhere else with someone else’s parcels. Inside, Wardrobe kept moving: scissors, steam, the low murmur of women doing work that deserved to arrive in Queensland with someone there to explain it properly.

I tapped the Thai takeaway number I had on speed-dial.

One decision at a time.
