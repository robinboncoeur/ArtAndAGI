**Final Scene — “Flying North” (Charli POV, 1st person, past tense)**

I had never realised how *loud* clouds were.

Not outside, obviously. Outside they looked as they always had from the ground—soft and ridiculous and ornamental, like someone had gone mad with a piping bag across the sky.

But from my window seat they were a bright, searing white that pressed at my eyes, and the engine hummed and shuddered under my feet, and the little plastic oval of the window vibrated against my forehead every time I leaned on it (which I did, approximately every thirty seconds, as if the view might have changed in that time).

We were actually doing it. I was actually doing it. Queensland. Maleny. The new Faire. A whole new Wardrobe, waiting for us like an unwritten pattern.

It would have been easier if we’d simply been scooped up by a benevolent hand and placed on the plane without warning—if I hadn’t had to walk away from Celeste.

My chest still hurt from the way she’d held me at the gate.

That was the freshest thing in my mind, the rawest, so of course it was where my thoughts went first, circling it like a tongue worrying a sore tooth even as I tried to look out of the window and think of absolutely anything else.

Celeste had done her very best impression of calm, sensible, supportive grown-up right up until the woman at the check-in desk had printed my boarding pass and put the little tag on my suitcase handle. She’d stood behind me in line, hands on my shoulders, body a solid, warm presence that I kept leaning back into as if I could fuse with her and avoid the whole problem of leaving.

“You can still say no,” she’d said quietly, one last time, as if we were at the edge of a diving platform instead of in front of a conveyor belt. “Right up until they close the doors. There is no noble suffering prize for doing something that feels wrong in your bones.”

“It doesn’t feel wrong,” I’d said, throat tight. “It feels… enormous. Which is different.”

She’d given a little broken laugh at that, and then the tears had started in her eyes, sudden and sharp, as if someone had nicked a vein.

“Enormous is allowed,” she’d said. “Enormous I can work with. Enormous we can text about.”

We’d had to move then—the line behind us had not, regrettably, been suspended by fate while we had our moment. Lauren had hugged me hard enough to squeak my ribs and murmured, “Bring her back to me intact,” into Sarah’s ear with that dry, fierce look she had developed lately. Mara had kissed my forehead and said, very softly, “Do not forget, petite rossignol, you know more than you think you do,” which had made my eyes go even more traitorously wet.

And then it had been just Celeste and me, right up against the barrier where only one of us was allowed to pass.

She’d cupped my face in both hands, thumbs pressing gently into the hollow beneath my cheekbones as if she was memorising the shape of me.

“I am so proud of you,” she’d said, low enough that the milling airport sounds didn’t steal it. “Not for going to Queensland. For *choosing*. For saying yes with your whole self when it would have been so much simpler to stay put and let other people be brave on your behalf.”

I’d wanted to say, I don’t feel brave, I feel like a jelly in shoes, but the words had jammed behind the lump in my throat. So I’d just nodded and tried to look like the sort of person who could board a plane and deal with whatever waited on the other end without dissolving.

“Go and be magnificent,” she’d said, and then, because she could never leave well enough alone, “and come home.”

We’d both cried by then, uselessly, unattractively, clinging in the middle of Departures while the rest of the world pretended not to look. Sarah had politely become fascinated by a vending machine. Lauren had stared very hard at a poster advertising travel insurance.

And then security had loomed, horribly official, and I’d had to actually *walk away*.

It hurt to think about, sitting there with a paper cup of airline water sweating on the tray table. My eyes prickled. I made myself look out at the clouds again.

The brightness outside was almost aggressive. The wing rose and fell with those tiny, corrective shivers that reminded me, unhelpfully, of how much metal and fuel and physics were involved in keeping us from plummeting into the patchwork paddocks far below.

I let my mind slide backwards, past the gate, past the hugging, past the careful packing of the night before where we’d argued lightly about how many pairs of socks I really needed, to the moment everything had first felt properly unsafe.

The loading bay.

It had been three months ago and also it had been yesterday. My body couldn’t quite decide.

The memory was so vivid I could feel the concrete under my shoes again, gritty and warm, and the weight of the bolt of cloth in my arms, and then the heat of a hand that had no right to be there sliding across my back as if I were an extension of the crate, something to be steadied, not someone to be asked.

The instant freeze. The way my throat had locked around all the words I theoretically knew how to say. The old, familiar shame—not just at him, or at the way his fingers had pressed, but at my own body for going statuesque and stupid instead of fierce and clever like Celeste or calm and deadly like Sarah.

Sarah *had* been calm and deadly. She’d appeared as if summoned, gently removed the bolt from my arms, placed herself between me and the rep, and told him, in that flat tone that made grown men sit up straight, that we did not touch staff, we did not brush past staff, we did not use staff as bracing surfaces, and if he wanted to accrue the privilege of proximity he could start by treating the women in the room as if they had spines and names.

He’d apologised, of course. They always apologised once they were caught. He’d made that face, the one that said he was far more offended by being told off than he had ever been invested in the initial touch. I’d smiled and laughed it off with my mouth while my eyes did their very best goldfish impression.

And then I’d gone home and curled up on the couch and felt small and stupid and furious with myself, because surely, *by now*, after everything, I should have known better than to freeze.

Queensland had loomed after that like a phrase in a language I didn’t speak yet. New site, new men, new hands, new versions of that moment. I’d imagined myself stiff and wordless in loading bays I’d never seen, in corridors and costume sheds and gravel carparks, Sarah somewhere further down the line, too far away to interpose, Celeste hundreds of kilometres south.

It had taken weeks before the courier with the clipboard had arrived and I’d heard myself say, very calmly, “Could you please step back a bit?” before my brain could get in the way. He’d stepped back. The world hadn’t cracked. No one had died of embarrassment. And I had stood there, heart pounding, and thought, *oh. Oh, it can be this, too.*

Now, on the plane, with the engine humming and the clouds ganging up outside, I thought of that courier like a rehearsal. A tiny dress rehearsal in a small loading bay, for all the bigger stages that might be waiting.

I turned my head slightly and looked across the narrow gulf of the aisle at Sarah.

She was in the aisle seat, of course. She’d insisted on it in that brisk way she had when she wanted to take responsibility for the part of the environment nearest the exit.

“If anything happens, I’m between you and it,” she’d said when we chose our seats. “Also, I get twitchy if I can’t see the aisle. You get the window, you like clouds. Everyone wins.”

She was reading now—or pretending to. The in-flight magazine was open on her lap, but I could tell from the way her eyes weren’t moving that she was somewhere else entirely, probably rearranging Queensland in her mind until it behaved to her standards.

I watched the line of her jaw, the relaxed set of her shoulders, the way her hand rested on the armrest, fingers loose and capable. A strange little ribbon of warmth uncurled in my chest.

I wasn’t going up there alone.

If some Queensland man decided that my back looked like a handrail again, there would be a woman within arm’s reach whose eyebrows could remove skin. I had seen Sarah deal with builders, with managers, with men who thought “just a bit of fun” was a spell that made consequences evaporate. She never raised her voice. She didn’t have to. She simply laid out reality and left it on the table like a pair of scissors—obvious, sharp, impossible to ignore.

It helped. It also, perversely, made me more determined that she wouldn’t have to leap to my rescue every time. I wanted, this time, not just to survive, but to *participate*.

The thought made my stomach swoop in a way that had nothing to do with the plane’s small adjustments.

My mind, unhelpfully, drifted further back.

To the pill bottle.

Celeste had found it by accident, of course. The things you meant to hide properly were always the ones betrayed by a lazy moment.

I’d left my bag half unzipped on the bed, hurriedly, some evening when we were late for dinner at Mara’s and I’d been debating with myself about whether or not to take that night’s dose.

She’d gone looking for a hair tie. Her hand had brushed against the plastic cylinder. The rattle had given it away.

I’d come in brushing my own hair and seen her standing there, the bottle in her hand, the label turned towards her, eyes moving over the letters with a slow, horrified comprehension.

“Charli,” she’d said, with a breath that was almost a laugh. “Why does my girlfriend have a prescription drug with ‘-lactone’ at the end in her bag and I am only finding out about it now?”

I’d tried to make a joke—I don’t even remember which one now, they were all terrible—but it had died immediately at the look on her face.

Not anger. Not exactly. Something sharper and softer at the same time. Fear, threaded with protectiveness, wrapped around a core of *you have been carrying this alone*. She’d looked like someone who’d just discovered a crack running through the foundation of their house and realised it had been there for ages.

We’d had The Conversation after that. About how scared I had been of my own body, of puberty coming late like a delayed train with no announced platform. About how the thought of going in the wrong direction had made me feel like I’d been sealed in concrete. About reading too much on the internet, and sitting in waiting rooms with doctors who looked more exhausted than cruel, and how the bottle had felt like a spell I could cast on myself to stay nearer the version of me that made sense in my own head.

She’d been angry, yes. Furious, even. But not with me.

With systems. With parents. With a world that would rather avert its gaze than have a teenager sit quietly in a room and say “I think I might not be who you thought I was” and be believed the first time.

That conversation—those hours on the bed with the bottle between us like evidence—had been the first time I’d fully understood that Celeste didn’t just *like* me, or even just *love* me; she saw me as a responsibility she had willingly taken on. Not to control. To shelter. To argue with, sometimes, fiercely, for my own sake.

It was, in a strange way, the same energy that had led her to say yes to Fiona, yes to Queensland, yes to the terrifying project of sending me away.

If she had been anyone else, she might have kept me back. Wrapped me in cotton wool. Swallowed the QLD contract rather than risk me in a new environment.

Instead, she had stood there with her hands on my shoulders and said I trust you. I trust Sarah. I trust myself to listen if you say stop.

Trust had always been a more frightening word to me than love.

Love was dizzy and delicious and intoxicating. Trust was weight. Anchor. The knowledge that someone had placed a part of their future happiness in your hands and expected you not to run off with it.

Now, on the plane, with Sarah’s solid presence beside me and Celeste’s last messages sitting patiently on my phone in Airplane Mode, I felt that weight and did not hate it.

I let my thoughts drift further back, past the pills, past the loading bay, to something gentler.

The first time I’d stood in the middle of Wardrobe and realised, quite suddenly, that I was not… extra.

I’d been at the big table, smoothing a length of linen that did not want to lie flat, tongue poking out between my teeth in that extremely dignified way I had developed when concentrating. Around me, women moved as if to some internal choreography—Mara with her shears, Sarah with her chalk, Lauren with a mug of tea she was pretending wasn’t a grounding mechanism.

Someone had called, “Charli, can you pass me the tape?” and I had done so automatically, and then a moment later someone else had said, “Where’s Charli, we need her hands for this fit,” and there was no edge in it, no indulgence. Just expectation.

Not tolerance.

Inclusion.

I’d looked up and around and felt, for the first time in my life, that particular, dizzying thought: *I am one of you.*

Not their mascot. Not a guest. Not the strange, half-boy, half-question mark creature lingering at the edges of other people’s lives.

One of the women.

It had made my knees go a little funny, and I’d had to pretend to stretch so I could disguise the way my legs wanted to give out. Later that night, Celeste had asked why I’d gone so quiet, and I’d said, “I think I belong,” and she’d made a sound that was half sob, half triumph, and kissed me until the notion was welded into place.

High school had been the opposite of that.

High school had been corridors that smelt of sweat and disinfectant, uniforms that never quite felt like they were for me, mirrors that showed a lanky, uncertain boy-shape I only recognised from the inside out in odd flashes.

It felt, now, like a terrible first draft I had written under duress. This—Wardrobe, Celeste, Sarah, the flat, the arguments about sock quantities, the soft, solid weight of Lauren’s trust when she put her house in our collective hands—felt like the real version, the one I might actually want to read again.

The captain’s voice crackled over the intercom, cheerfully announcing that we were beginning our descent into Brisbane, that the weather on the ground was warm and slightly humid, that we might experience “a few bumps” on the way down.

I could have told him that. My stomach was *already* doing bumps.

I glanced sideways again. Sarah had closed the magazine at last and was looking straight ahead, that particular focus on her face she got when she was running through lists in her head.

“Are you okay?” I asked, before I could talk myself out of it.

She turned her head and gave me a long, assessing look, the kind she usually reserved for unstable hemming tape.

“I’m fine,” she said, which from her meant something entirely different than it did from most people. “Mildly irritated that I can’t get up and pace, but I’ll live.”

“And… about everything else?” I ventured.

Her mouth curved.

“Nervous,” she admitted. “Excited. Already planning the cupboard layout in my mind. Deeply determined that no one will hang one of Mara’s coats on a bent nail. Standard levels of pre-mission agitation.”

It was so gloriously Sarah that I couldn’t help but smile.

“You?” she added, and there it was, the small, gentle return of the question. She never left me hanging on a limb alone if she could help it.

“Terrified,” I said honestly. “And also… glad. That I said yes. That you’re here. That Celeste didn’t put her foot down and keep me at home like a particularly anxious pot plant.”

“She couldn’t have, even if she’d wanted to,” Sarah said. “We’d have mutinied on your behalf.”

The idea of Mara and Sarah staging a small domestic coup to liberate me from Celeste’s hypothetical overprotection was so lovely I wanted to frame it.

“And anyway,” Sarah went on, softer, “you are not a pot plant. You’re… I don’t know. A very determined climbing rose. You’re going to put roots wherever we land, whether Queensland likes it or not.”

That did it. My eyes went hot and stupid again.

“You realise you just called me a rose on a plane full of strangers,” I muttered.

“Good,” she said. “Let them take notes.”

The seatbelt sign pinged on. The plane dipped, gently, like a curtsy. The clouds shifted from bright knife-edged white to softer, shaggier shapes as we slid down through them.

I pressed my hand against the cool plastic of the window, palm flat, and imagined, very clearly, the line from my fingers back through the fuselage, back along the invisible airboard trace to Melbourne, to the little flat with the too-small bed where, at that precise moment, Celeste was probably pacing with her phone in her hand, pretending to read an article and not reading a single word.

I could almost hear her voice already, when I would turn my phone back on after landing and the messages would come in all at once.

*Are you down? Do you still exist? Is Queensland terrible? Tell me everything in excruciating detail.*

The thought steadied me in a way no seatbelt ever could.

I glanced at Sarah. She met my eyes, and in that look there was a whole speech: *We will do this. We will be tired and hot and occasionally furious, and then we will come home and tell Celeste every awful, hilarious, glorious detail until she feels like she was there too.*

The plane banked. Out of the window, far below, I could see the faint line of the coast and the dark, folded green of the hinterland rising up behind it like the hem of a skirt.

Somewhere in all that green there would be a half-built site, a new Wardrobe, a bunch of nervous, eager women who had no idea yet that the clothes they were unpacking came with ghosts and love and history sewn into every seam.

I took a breath that felt like stepping into cold water.

I was going to meet them as myself.

Not as a boy in the wrong uniform, not as a question mark hiding in plain sight, not as the girl who froze and then hated herself for it.

As Charli.

Celeste’s girl. Wardrobe’s girl. My own girl.

I reached across the narrow gap and curled my fingers around Sarah’s where they rested on the armrest.

“Ready?” she asked.

“No,” I said, heart hammering. “Yes. Both.”

“Perfect,” she said, giving my hand a squeeze. “That’s exactly right.”

As the plane dipped further and the world rose up to meet us, I pressed my forehead one more time against the humming window and let myself believe, properly, that I was exactly where I was meant to be: flying north with a woman I trusted at my side, another one waiting for me in a small, messy flat far below the clouds, and the next chapter of my life laid out somewhere between the coast and the hills, ready to be stitched.

**Final Scene — “Flying North” (Charli POV, 1st person, past tense)**

Flying North, As Charli

I had never realised how *loud* everything was up here in the clouds.

Not outside, obviously. Outside they looked as they always had from the ground—soft and cuddly and a bit ornamental, like someone had gone mad with a piping bag across the sky.

But from my window seat they were a bright, searing white that pressed at my eyes. In here, the engine hummed and shuddered under my feet, and the little plastic oval of the window vibrated against my forehead every time I leaned on it (which I did, approximately every thirty seconds, as if the view might have changed in that time).

We were actually doing it. And I was actually doing it. Queensland. Maleny. The new Faire. A whole new Wardrobe, waiting for us like an unwritten pattern.

It would have been easier if we’d simply been scooped up by a kind hand at Wardrobe and placed in our seats on the plane without all the rest of leaving—if I hadn’t had to walk down a ramp, away from Celeste.

My chest still hurt from the way she’d held me at the gate.

That was the freshest thing in my mind, the rawest. It was a new pain so I had nothing to compare it to. I stared out at snowy white clouds dropping away below us, but all I could see were her eyes even as I tried to think of absolutely anything else.

Celeste had done her very best impression of calm, sensible, supportive grown-up right up until the woman at the check-in desk had printed my boarding pass and put the little tag on my suitcase handle. She’d stood behind me in line, hands on my shoulders, her body a solid, warm presence that I kept leaning back into as if I could fuse with her and somehow avoid the whole pain of leaving.

“You can still say no,” she’d said quietly, one last time, as if we were at the edge of a diving platform instead of in front of a conveyor belt. “Right up until they close the doors. There is no noble suffering prize for doing something that feels wrong in your bones.”

“It doesn’t feel wrong,” I’d said, throat tight. “It feels… enormous. Which is different.”

She’d given a little broken laugh at that, and then the tears had started in her eyes, sudden and sharp, as if a cold wind had come up from the south.

“Enormous is allowed,” she’d said. “Enormous I can work with. Enormous we can text about.”

We’d had to move then—the line behind us had not, regrettably, been suspended by fate while we had our moment. Lauren had hugged me hard enough to squeak my ribs and murmured, “Bring her back to me intact,” into Sarah’s ear with that dry, fierce look she had developed lately. Mara had kissed my forehead and said, very softly, “Do not forget, my little nightingale, you know a lot more than you think you do,” which had made my eyes go even more traitorously wet.

And then it had been just Celeste and me, right up against the barrier where only one of us was allowed to pass.

She’d cupped my face in both hands, thumbs pressing gently into the hollow beneath my cheekbones as if she was memorising the shape of me.

“I am so proud of you,” she’d said, low enough that the milling airport sounds didn’t steal it. “Not for going to Queensland. For *choosing*. For saying yes with your whole self when it would have been so much easier to stay and let other people be brave on your behalf.”

I’d wanted to say, I don’t feel brave, I feel like a jelly in leggings, but the words had jammed behind the lump in my throat. So I’d just nodded and tried to look like the sort of person who could board a plane and deal with whatever waited on the other end without dissolving.

“Go and be magnificent,” she’d said, and then, because she could never leave well enough alone, “and come home.”

We’d both cried by then, uselessly, unattractively, clinging in the middle of Departures while the rest of the world pretended not to look. Sarah had politely become fascinated by a vending machine. Lauren had stared very hard at a poster advertising travel insurance.

And then security had loomed, horribly official, and I’d had to actually *walk away*.

It hurt to think about, sitting there with a paper cup of airline water sweating on the tray table. My eyes stung again, thinking about it. 

I made myself look out at the clouds.

The brightness outside was almost aggressive. The wing rose and fell with those tiny, corrective shivers that reminded me, unhelpfully, of how much metal and fuel and physics were involved in keep us climbing into the harsh sunlight.

I pushed my mind past the gate, past the hugging, past the careful packing of the night before where we’d argued lightly about how many pairs of socks I really needed, to a moment my chosen life had first felt properly unsafe.

The loading bay.

It had been three months ago and also it had been yesterday. My body couldn’t quite decide.

The memory was so vivid I could feel the concrete under my thin-soled shoes again, gritty and warm, and the weight of the bolt of cloth in my arms, and then the heat of a hand that had no right to be there sliding across my back as if I were an extension of the crate, some *thing*. Not *someone*, not a person who deserves to be asked.

The instant terror, every nerve on high alert. The way my throat had locked around all the words I knew how to say, I knew I should say but I was too frozen with fright. The unfamiliar, stupifying shame—not just at how I let this man touch me, or at the way his fingers had pressed, but at my own body for turning me into statue and stupid instead of fierce and clever like Celeste or calm and deadly like Sarah.

Sarah *had* been calm and deadly. She’d appeared as if my body had screeched an alarm, gently removed the bolt from my arms, placed herself between me and the rep, and told him, in that flat tone that made confident grins turn into weak apologies, that no-one touches staff, no-one brushes past staff, staff are not bracing surfaces, and if he wanted to accrue the privilege of proximity he could start by treating the women in the room as if they had spines and names.

He’d apologised, of course. There was always some sort of apology once they were caught, an apology his face lied about, a face that said he was far more offended by being told off than he had ever been invested in the initial touch. And I’d smiled like an idiot and tried to laugh it off with my mouth while my eyes did their very best goldfish impression.

And then I’d gone home and curled up on the couch and felt small and stupid and furious with myself, because surely, *by now*, after *everything*, I should have known better than to freeze.

That’s why Queensland had loomed after that like a phrase in a language I didn’t speak yet. New site, new men, new hands, new versions of that moment. I’d imagined myself stiff and wordless in loading bays I’d never seen, in corridors and costume sheds and gravel carparks, Sarah somewhere further down the line, too far away to interpose, Celeste hundreds of kilometres south.

It had taken weeks before the courier with the clipboard had arrived and I’d heard myself say, very calmly, “Could you please step back a bit?” before my brain could get in the way. And he’d stepped back. The world hadn’t cracked. No one had died of embarrassment. And I had stood there, heart pounding, and thought, *oh. Oh, so it can be this, too.*

Now, on the plane, with the engine humming and the clouds ganging up outside, I thought of that courier like a rehearsal. A tiny dress rehearsal in a small loading bay, for all the bigger stages that might be waiting.

I turned my head slightly and looked across the narrow gulf of the aisle at Sarah.

She was in the aisle seat, of course. She’d insisted on it in that brisk way she had when she wanted to take responsibility for the part of the environment nearest the exit.

“If anything happens, I’m between you and it,” she’d said when we chose our seats. “Also, I get twitchy if I can’t be near the aisle. You get the window, you like clouds. Everyone wins.”

She was reading now—or pretending to. The in-flight magazine was open on her lap, but I could tell from the way her eyes weren’t moving that she was somewhere else entirely, probably rearranging Queensland in her mind until it behaved to her standards.

I watched the line of her jaw, the relaxed set of her shoulders, the way her hand rested on the armrest, fingers loose and capable. A strange little ribbon of warmth uncurled in my chest. 

Gratitude.

I wasn’t going up there alone.

If some Queensland man decided that my back looked like a handrail again, there would be a woman within arm’s reach whose eyebrows could peel skin. I had seen Sarah deal with builders, with managers, with men who thought “just a bit of fun” was a spell that coated improper behaviour with a veneer of normalcy and made consequences evaporate. She never raised her voice. She didn’t have to. She simply laid out reality and left it on the table like a pair of scissors—obvious, sharp, impossible to ignore.

It made all the difference. 

It also, perversely, made me more determined that she wouldn’t have to leap to my rescue every time. I wanted, this time, not just to survive, but to *participate*. No disappearing, but bravely being a woman like Sarah.

Being a woman.

The thought made my stomach swoop in a way that had nothing to do with the plane’s small adjustments.

My mind, unhelpfully, drifted further back to the pill bottle.

My solution to a more successful hiding, in plain sight.

Celeste had found it by accident, of course. The things you wanted to hide properly were always the ones betrayed by a lazy moment. And, back then, I had instinctively sensed that Celeste wouldn't have approved.

I’d left my bag half unzipped on the bed, hurriedly, one evening when needed a shower more than dinner and I’d been debating with myself about whether or not to take that night’s dose.

She’d gone looking for a hair tie and had found a plastic cylinder.

I’d come in brushing still-damp hair and seen her standing there, the bottle on the table, her eyes turned towards me, eyes asking, horrified, not comprehending.

“Where did you get it?”

I hadn’t even tried to come up with an excuse—the whole thinking that led to the tablets was so painfully ridiculous at that point. All I could see was the threat. Losing Wardrobe, losing friends, losing her.

And then, her look. Not anger. Not exactly. Something sharper and softer at the same time. It was fear, threaded with something I would never have expected—protectiveness. 

Of me?

We’d had The Conversation after that. About how scared I had been of what my body was going to do to my life, of puberty I’d hoped I had magically avoided coming late like a delayed train with no announced platform. About how the horror of the changes—the darkening of leg hair, the changes in my voice—had made me feel like I’d been sealed in concrete. About reading too much on the internet, and sitting in waiting rooms with doctors who looked more exhausted than cruel, and how the bottle had felt like a spell I could cast on myself to stay nearer the version of me that made sense in my own head.

She’d been angry, yes. Furious, even. But not with me.

With systems. With parents. With a world that would rather avert its gaze than have a teenager sit quietly in a room and say “I think I might not be who you thought I was” and be believed the first time.

That conversation—those hours on the bed with the bottle between us like evidence—had been the first time I’d fully understood that Celeste didn’t just *like* me as a person; she saw me as a responsibility she had willingly taken on. Not to control. To shelter. To argue with, sometimes, fiercely, for my own sake.

And even more surprising, that she might even *love* me.

Thinking back on that night, it was, in a strange way, the same energy that had led her to say yes to Fiona, yes to Queensland, yes to the terrifying project of sending me away.

If she had been anyone else, she might have kept me back. Wrapped me in cotton wool. Swallowed the QLD contract rather than risk me in a new environment.

Instead, she had stood there with her hands on my shoulders and said I trust you. I trust Sarah. I trust myself to hear and react if you say stop.

Trust had always been a more frightening word to me than love.

Love was dizzy and delicious and intoxicating. Trust was weight. Anchor. The knowledge that someone had placed a part of their future happiness in your hands and expected you not to run off with it.

Now, on the plane, with Sarah’s solid presence beside me and Celeste’s last messages sitting patiently on my phone in Airplane Mode, I felt that weight and did not hate it.

Her message led my thoughts further back, past the pills, past the loading bay, to something deep inside. At the time, somewhere in limbo between X and Y. Feeling the warmth and closeness of people who thought like me, who I could be myself with, who *wanted* me like this, and who identified me to me. And how that all had me actively refusing Y, wanting X, desperately, ignorantly, not realising any of what X has in its handbag—the Pandora’s Box of womanhood.

TIt started the first time I’d stood in the middle of Wardrobe and realised, quite suddenly, that I was not… extra. Or foreign. Not in the right place. I’d been at the big table, smoothing a length of linen that did not want to lie flat, tongue poking out between my teeth in that extremely dignified way I had developed when concentrating. Around me, women moved as if to some internal choreography—Mara with her shears, Sarah with her chalk, Mum with a mug of tea she was pretending wasn’t a grounding mechanism.

Someone had called, “Charli, can you pass me the tape?” and I had done so automatically, and then a moment later someone else had said, “Where’s Charli, we need her hands for this fit,” and there was no edge in it, no sarcasm. Just expectation.

Not tolerance.

Inclusion.

I’d looked up and around and felt, for the first time in my life, that particular, dizzying thought: *I am one of you.*

Not their mascot. Not a guest. Not the strange, half-boy, half-question mark creature lingering at the edges of other people’s lives.

One of the women.

As I stared out at the flapping wing, it suddenly came to me, the reason that boy in year ten had asked me: "Are you *scared* of girls?" I didn't know what to answer then, so I'd hotly denied it. And realised now, watching the flight attendant walk slowing uphill to the front of the aeroplane, that what I'd felt wasn't fear, it was simply: personhood. Girls weren't objects to ogle, they were people, like me.

In Wardrobe, when Lucy called me 'she', it had made my knees go a little funny, and I’d had to pretend to stretch so I could disguise the way my legs wanted to give out. I felt like the light shining inside of me was so bright, people were going to be blinded by it.

And later that night, Celeste had asked why I’d gone so quiet, and I’d blurted out, “I think I belong,” but I don't think she knew why I said that, at the time. And I was afraid to tell her.

Belonging.

High school had been the opposite of that.

High school had been corridors that smelt of sweat and disinfectant, uniforms that never felt like they were for me, mirrors that showed a skinny, short, uncertain boy-shape I hardly ever looked at, and only recognised from the inside out in odd flashes.

It felt, now, like a terrible first draft I had written under duress. This—Wardrobe, Celeste, Sarah, the flat, the arguments about sock quantities, the soft, solid weight of Mum’s pride when she tightly hugged me at the aeroport—felt like the real version, the one I might actually want to read again.

The captain’s voice crackled over the intercom, cheerfully announcing that we were beginning our descent into Brisbane, that the weather on the ground was warm and slightly humid, that we might experience “a few bumps” on the way down.

My stomach was *already* doing bumps.

I glanced sideways again. Sarah had closed the magazine at last and was looking straight ahead, that particular focus on her face she got when she was running through lists in her head.

“Are you okay?” I asked, before I could talk myself out of it.

She turned her head and gave me a long, assessing look, the kind she usually reserved for unstable hemming tape.

“I’m good, thanks,” she said, which from her meant something entirely different than it did from most people. “Mildly irritated that I can’t get up and pace, but I’ll live.”

“And… about everything else?” I ventured.

Her mouth curved.

“Nervous,” she admitted. “Excited. Already planning the cupboard layout in my head. Deeply determined that no one will hang one of Mara’s coats on a bent nail. Standard levels of pre-mission agitation.”

It was so gloriously Sarah that I couldn’t help but smile.

“You?” she added, and there it was, the small, gentle return of the question. She never left me hanging on a limb alone if she could help it.

“Terrified,” I said honestly. “And also… glad. That I said yes. And so glad that you’re here. That Celeste didn’t put her foot down and keep me at home like a particularly anxious pot plant.”

“She couldn’t have, even if she’d wanted to,” Sarah said. “We’d have mutinied on your behalf.”

The idea of Mara and Sarah staging a small domestic coup to liberate me from Celeste’s hypothetical overprotection was so lovely I wanted to frame it.

“And anyway,” Sarah went on, softer, “you are not a pot plant. You’re… I don’t know. A very determined climbing rose. You’re going to put roots wherever we land, whether Queensland likes it or not.”

That did it. My eyes went hot and stupid again.

“You realise you just called me a rose on a plane full of strangers,” I muttered.

“Good,” she said. “They should take notes.”

The seatbelt sign pinged on. The plane dipped, gently, like a curtsey. The clouds shifted from bright knife-edged white to softer, shaggier shapes as we slid down through them.

I pressed my hand against the cool plastic of the window, palm flat, and imagined, very clearly, the line from my fingers back through the fuselage, back along the invisible airboard trace to Melbourne, to the little flat with the too-small bed where, at that precise moment, Celeste was probably pacing with her phone in her hand, pretending to read an article and not absorbing a single word.

I could almost hear her voice already, when I would turn my phone back on after landing and the messages would come in all at once.

*Are you down? Do you still exist? Is Queensland terrible? Tell me everything in excruciating detail.*

The thought steadied me in a way no seatbelt ever could.

I glanced at Sarah. She met my eyes, and in that look there was a whole speech: *We're going to do this. We will be tired and hot and occasionally furious, and then we will come home and tell Celeste every awful, hilarious, glorious detail until she feels like she was there too.*

The plane banked. Out of the window, far below, I could see the faint line of the coast and the dark, folded green of the hinterland rising up behind it like the hem of a skirt.

Somewhere in all that green there would be a half-built site, a new Wardrobe, a bunch of nervous, eager women who had no idea yet that the clothes they were unpacking came with ghosts and love and history sewn into every seam.

I took a breath that felt like stepping into cold water.

I was going to meet them as myself.

Not as a boy in the wrong uniform, not as a question mark hiding in plain sight, not as the girl who froze and then hated herself for it.

As Charli.

Celeste’s girl. Wardrobe’s girl. My own girl.

I reached across the narrow gap and curled my fingers around Sarah’s where they rested on the armrest.

“Ready?” she asked.

“No,” I said, heart hammering. “Yes. Both.”

“Perfect,” she said, giving my hand a squeeze. “There she is!”

As the plane dipped further and the world rose up to meet us, I pressed my forehead one more time against the humming window and let myself believe, properly, that I was exactly where I was meant to be: flying north with a woman I trusted at my side, another one waiting for me in a small, messy flat far below the clouds, and the next chapter of my life laid out somewhere between the coast and the hills, ready to be stitched.

Oh, Robyn. This lands. ❤️
The emotional spine is absolutely there: Celeste at the gate, the loading bay, the pill bottle, Wardrobe as belonging, and then Charli literally and metaphorically *in transit* into her next chapter. The “triangulation” between Celeste, Sarah, and Charli is really satisfying.

What I’ll do below is:

* Keep structure, voice, and beats exactly as you’ve built them.
* Smooth awkward joins (pill bottle/X–Y bit, “are you scared of girls?” line, a couple of phrasing tangles).
* Fix typos / tense hiccups / small repetitions.
* Nudge clarity very gently where the abstractions got a bit dense.

Here’s a polished pass of the scene as a single, clean draft.

---

### Final Scene — “Flying North”

*(Charli POV, 1st person, past tense)*

I had never realised how *loud* everything was up here in the clouds.

Not outside, obviously. Outside the clouds looked soft and cuddly and a bit ornamental, like someone had gone mad with a piping bag across the sky.

But from my window seat they were a bright, searing white that stung my eyes. In here, the engine hummed and shuddered the floor under my feet, and the little plastic oval of the window vibrated against my forehead every time I leaned on it—which I did, approximately every thirty seconds, as if the view might have changed in that time.

We were actually doing it. And *I* was actually doing it. Queensland. Maleny. The new Les-Mis Faire. A whole new Wardrobe, waiting for us like an unwritten pattern.

It would have been easier if we’d simply been scooped up by a kind hand at Wardrobe and placed in our seats on the plane without all the rest of leaving—if I hadn’t had to walk down a ramp, *away from Celeste*.

My chest still hurt from the way she’d held me at the gate.

That was the freshest thing in my mind, the rawest. It was a new pain so I had nothing to compare it to. I stared out at snowy white clouds dropping away below us, but all I could see were her eyes, even as I tried to think of absolutely anything else.

Celeste had done her very best impression of calm, sensible, supportive grown-up right up until the woman at the check-in desk had printed my boarding pass and put the little tag on my carry-on. She’d stood behind me in line, hands on my shoulders, her body a solid, warm presence that I kept leaning back into as if I could fuse with her and somehow avoid the whole pain of leaving.

“You can still say no,” she’d said quietly, one last time, as if we were at the edge of a diving platform instead of in front of a conveyor belt. “Right up until they close the doors. There is no noble suffering prize for doing something that feels wrong in your bones.”

“It doesn’t feel wrong,” I’d said, throat tight. “It feels… enormous. Which is different.”

She’d given a little broken laugh at that, and then the tears had started in her eyes, sudden and sharp, as if a cold wind had blown into them from the south.

“Enormous is allowed,” she’d said. “Enormous I can work with. Enormous we can text about.”

We’d had to move then—the line behind us had not, regrettably, been suspended by fate while we had our moment. Mum had hugged me hard enough to squeak my ribs and murmured, “Bring her back to me intact,” into Sarah’s ear with that dry, fierce look she’d developed lately. Mara had kissed my forehead and said, very softly, “Do not forget, my little nightingale, you know a lot more than you think you do,” which had made my eyes go even more traitorously wet.

And then it had been just Celeste and me, right up against the barrier where only one of us was allowed to pass.

She’d cupped my face in both hands, thumbs pressing gently into the hollows beneath my cheekbones as if she was memorising the shape of me.

“I am so proud of you,” she’d said, low enough that the milling airport sounds didn’t steal it. “Not for going to Queensland. For *choosing*. For saying yes with your whole self when it would have been so much easier to stay and let other people be brave on your behalf.”

I’d wanted to say, *I don’t feel brave, I feel like a jelly in leggings*, but the words had jammed behind the lump in my throat. So I’d just nodded and tried to look like the sort of person who could board a plane and deal with whatever waited on the other end without dissolving.

“Go and be magnificent,” she’d said, and then, because she could never leave well enough alone, “and *come home.*”

We’d both cried by then, uselessly, unattractively, clinging in the middle of Departures while the rest of the world pretended not to look. Sarah had politely become fascinated by a vending machine. Mum had stared very hard at a poster advertising travel insurance.

And then security had loomed, horribly official, and I’d had to actually *walk away*.

It hurt to think about, sitting there with a paper cup of airline water sweating on the tray table. My eyes stung again, thinking about it.

I made myself look out at the clouds.

The brightness outside was almost aggressive. The wing rose and fell with those tiny, corrective shivers that reminded me, unhelpfully, of how much metal and fuel and physics were involved in keeping us climbing into the harsh sunlight.

I pushed my mind past the gate, past the hugging, past the careful packing of the night before where we’d argued lightly about how many pairs of socks I really needed, to a moment my chosen existence had first felt properly unsafe.

The loading bay.

It had been three months ago and also it had been yesterday. My body couldn’t quite decide.

The memory was so vivid I could still feel the concrete under my thin-soled shoes, gritty and warm, and the weight of the bolt of cloth in my arms, and then the heat of that unwelcome hand, a hand that had no right to be there, sliding across my back as if I were an extension of the crate—some *thing*. 

Not *someone*, not a person who deserved to be asked.

Some—*thing*.

The instant terror, every nerve on high alert. The way my throat had locked around all the words I knew I should say, but I was too frozen with fright. The unfamiliar, stupefying shame—not just at how I’d let this man touch me, or at the way his fingers had pressed, but at my own body for turning me into statue and stupid, instead of fierce and clever like Celeste, or calm and deadly like Sarah.

Sarah *had* been calm and deadly. Of *course* she had. She’d appeared as if my body had screeched an alarm, gently removed the bolt from my arms, placed herself between me and the rep, and told him, in that flat tone that made confident grins turn into weak apologies, that no-one touches staff, no-one brushes past staff, staff are not bracing surfaces, and if he wanted to accrue the privilege of proximity he could start by treating the women in the room as if they had spines and names.

He’d apologised, of course. There was always some sort of apology once they were caught—an apology his face lied about, a face that said he was far more offended by being told off than he had ever been invested in the initial touch.

And I’d smiled like an idiot and tried to laugh it off with my mouth, while my eyes did their very best goldfish impression.

And then I’d gone home and curled up on the couch and felt small and stupid and furious with myself, because surely, *by now*, after *everything*, I should have known better than to freeze.

Which was why Queensland had loomed after that like a phrase in a language I didn’t speak yet. New site, new men, new hands, new versions of that moment. I’d imagined myself stiff and wordless in loading bays I’d never seen, in corridors and costume sheds and gravel carparks, Sarah somewhere further down the line, too far away to interpose, Celeste hundreds of kilometres south.

It had taken weeks before the courier with the clipboard arrived and I heard myself say, very calmly, “Could I get you to please step back a bit?” before adrenaline could get in the way. 

He’d stepped back.

The world hadn’t cracked. 

No one had died of embarrassment. 

And I had stood there, heart pounding, and thought, *oh*. 

*Oh, so it can be this, too.*

Now, on the plane, with the engine humming and the clouds solid as sea foam, I thought of that courier like a rehearsal. A tiny dress rehearsal in a small loading bay, for all the bigger stages that might be waiting.

I turned my head slightly and glanced up at Sarah.

She was in the aisle seat, of course. She’d insisted on it in that brisk way she had when she wanted to take responsibility for the part of the environment nearest the exit.

“I get twitchy if I can’t be near the aisle,” she’d said when we chose our seats. “You get the window, you like looking at clouds. Everyone wins.”

She was reading now—or pretending to. The in-flight magazine was open on her lap, but I could tell from the way her eyes weren’t moving that she was somewhere else entirely, probably rearranging Queensland in her mind until it behaved to her standards.

I watched the line of her jaw, the relaxed set of her shoulders, the way her hand rested on the armrest, fingers loose and capable. A strange little ribbon of warmth uncurled in my chest.

Gratitude.

I wasn’t going up there alone.

If some Queensland man decided that my back looked like a handrail again, there would be a woman within arm’s reach whose eyebrows could peel skin. I had seen Sarah deal with builders, with managers, with men who thought “just a bit of fun” was a spell that coated improper behaviour with a veneer of normalcy and made consequences evaporate. She never raised her voice. She didn’t have to. She simply laid out reality and left it on the table like a pair of scissors—obvious, sharp, impossible to ignore.

It made all the difference.

It also, perversely, made me more determined that she wouldn’t have to leap to my rescue every time. I wanted, this time, not just to survive, but to *participate*. Not disappear, but actually show up as a woman like Sarah.

Be—a woman.

The thought made my stomach swoop in a way that had nothing to do with the plane’s small adjustments.

My mind, unhelpfully, drifted further back, to the pill bottle.

My solution for a more successful hiding, in plain sight.

Celeste had found it by accident. The things you wanted to hide properly were always the ones betrayed by a lazy moment. And, back then when I got the pills, I had instinctively sensed that Celeste wouldn’t have approved.

I’d left my bag half unzipped on the bed, hurriedly, one evening when I’d needed a shower more than dinner and I’d been debating with myself about whether or not to take that night’s dose.

She’d gone looking for a hair tie and had found a plastic cylinder.

I’d come in brushing still-damp hair and seen her standing there, the bottle on the table, her eyes turned towards me, eyes horrified, not comprehending.

“Where did you get this?”

I hadn’t even tried to come up with an excuse—the thinking that had led to the tablets was so painfully ridiculous at that point. All I could see was the threat. Losing Wardrobe, losing friends, losing *her*.

And then, her look. Not anger. Not exactly. Something sharper and softer at the same time. It was fear, threaded with something I would never have expected—protectiveness.

Of me.

We’d had The Conversation after that. About how petrified I had been of what my body was going to do to my life, of a puberty I’d hoped I had magically avoided coming late like a delayed train with no announced platform. About how the horror of the changes—the thickening of leg hair, the changes in my voice—had made me feel like I was being sealed in concrete. About reading too much on the internet in forums that promised solutions, and how the bottle had felt like a spell I could cast on myself to stay nearer the version of me that made sense in my own head.

She’d been angry, yes. Furious, even. But not with me.

With systems. 

With a world that would rather avert its gaze than have a teenager sit quietly in a room and say “I think I might not be who you thought I was” and be believed the first time.

That conversation—those hours on the bed with the bottle between us like evidence—had been the first time I’d fully understood that Celeste didn’t just *like* me as a person; she saw me as a responsibility she had willingly taken on. 

Not to control. To shelter. 

To argue with, sometimes, fiercely, for my own sake.

And even more surprising, that she might even *love* me.

Thinking back on that night, it was, in a strange way, the same energy that had led her to say yes to Fiona, yes to Queensland, yes to the terrifying thought of sending me away. From her. From *us*.

If she had been anyone else, she might have kept me back. Wrapped me in cotton wool. Swallowed the QLD contract rather than risk me in a new environment.

Instead, she had stood there with her hands on my shoulders and said *I trust you*. I trust Sarah. I trust myself to hear and react if you say stop.

Trust had always been a more frightening word to me than love.

Love was dizzy and delicious and intoxicating. Trust was weight. Anchor. The knowledge that someone had placed a part of their future happiness in your hands and expected you not to run off with it.

Now, on the plane, with Sarah’s solid presence beside me and Celeste’s last messages sitting patiently on my phone in Airplane Mode, I felt that weight and did not hate it.

My thoughts slid further back, past the pills, past the loading bay, to something deeper. That first sense of being somewhere between X and Y, chromosome letters that had felt like labels for a mistake. Feeling the warmth and closeness of people who thought like me, who I could be *myself* with, who *wanted* me like this, and who quietly identified me to myself. How all of that had made me actively refuse the “Y” version of my future and cling to “X,” desperately, ignorantly, not realising what womanhood carried in its handbag—the Pandora’s box of joys and hazards and expectations.

It had started the first time I’d stood in the middle of Wardrobe and realised, quite suddenly, that I was not… extra. Or foreign. Not in the wrong place.

I’d been at the big table, smoothing a length of linen that did not want to lie flat, tongue poking out between my teeth in that extremely dignified way I’d developed when concentrating. Around me, women moved as if to some internal choreography—Mara with her shears, Sarah with her chalk, Mum with a mug of tea she was pretending wasn’t a grounding mechanism.

Someone had called, “Charli, can you pass me the tape?” and I had done so automatically, and then a moment later someone else had said, “Where’s Charli, we need her hands for this fit,” and there was no edge in it, no sarcasm. Just expectation.

Not tolerance.

Inclusion.

I’d looked up and around and felt, for the first time in my life, that particular, dizzying thought: *I am one of you.*

Not a mascot or a guest. Not the strange, half-boy, half-question-mark creature lingering at the edges of other people’s lives.

One of the *women*.

As I stared out at the flapping wing, it suddenly came back to me, the reason that boy in year ten had asked, “Are you *scared* of girls?” I hadn’t known what to answer then, so I’d hotly denied it. Now, watching the flight attendant walk slowly uphill to the front of the cabin, I realised what he thought was fear was never that. 

It had simply been… personhood. 

Girls weren’t objects to ogle; they were people, like me.

In Wardrobe, when Lucy had called me “she,” it had made my knees go a little funny, and I’d had to pretend to stretch so I could disguise the way my legs wanted to give out. I’d felt like the light shining inside me was so bright, people were going to be blinded by it.

And later that night, Celeste had asked why I’d gone so quiet, and I’d blurted out, “I think I belong,” but I don’t think she’d known why I said that, at the time. And I’d been afraid to tell her what it felt like.

Lucy identifying me to me was… belonging. 

Belonging.

High school had been the opposite of that.

High school had been corridors that smelt of sweat and disinfectant, uniforms that never felt like they were for me, mirrors that showed a skinny, short, uncertain boy-shape I hardly ever looked at and only recognised from the inside out in odd flashes.

It felt, now, like a terrible first draft I had written under duress. This—Wardrobe, Celeste, Sarah, the flat, the arguments about sock quantities, the soft, solid weight of Mum’s pride when she’d hugged me tightly at the airport—felt like the real version, the one I might actually want to read again.

The captain’s voice crackled over the intercom, cheerfully announcing that we were beginning our descent into Brisbane, that the weather on the ground was warm and slightly humid, that we might experience “a few bumps” on the way down.

My stomach was *already* doing bumps.

I glanced at Sarah again. She had closed the magazine at last and was looking straight ahead, with that particular focus on her face she got when she was running through lists in her head.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

“Terrified,” I said honestly. “And also glad that I said yes. And… so glad that you’re here.”

The flight attendant pointed at my waist—I quickly fastened my seat belt. 

“Oh, and that Celeste didn’t put her foot down and keep me at home,” I added, “like a particularly anxious pot plant.” (1)

“She couldn’t have, even if she’d wanted to,” Sarah said. “We’d have mutinied on your behalf.”

The idea of Mara and Sarah staging a small domestic coup to liberate me from Celeste’s hypothetical overprotection was so lovely I wanted to frame it.

“And anyway,” Sarah went on, softer, “you are not a pot plant. You’re… I don’t know. A very determined climbing rose. You’re going to put roots wherever we land, whether Queensland likes it or not.”

That did it. My eyes went hot and stupid again.

“You realise you just called me a rose on a plane full of strangers,” I muttered.

“Good,” she said. “They should take notes.”

The seatbelt sign pinged on. The plane dipped, gently, like a curtsey. The clouds shifted from bright knife-edged white to softer, shaggier shapes as we slid down through them.

I pressed my hand against the cool plastic of the window, palm flat, and imagined, very clearly, the line from my fingers back through the fuselage, back along an invisible airborne trace to Torquay, to the little flat with the too-small bed where, at that precise moment, Celeste was probably pacing with her phone in her hand, pretending to read an article and not absorbing a single word.

I could almost hear her voice already, when I would turn my phone back on after landing and the messages would come in all at once.

*Are you down? Do you still exist? Is Queensland terrible? Tell me everything in excruciating detail.*

The thought steadied me in a way no seatbelt ever could.

I glanced at Sarah. She met my eyes, and in that look there was a whole speech: 

*We’re doing this! We will be tired and hot and occasionally frustrated, and then we will come home and tell Celeste every awful, hilarious, glorious detail until she feels like she was there too.*

The plane banked. Out of the window, far below, I could see the faint line of the coast and the dark, folded green of the hinterland rising up behind it like the hem of a skirt.

Somewhere in all that green there would be a half-built site, a new Wardrobe, a bunch of nervous, eager women who had no idea yet that the clothes they were unpacking came with ghosts and love and history sewn into every seam.

Not as a boy in the wrong uniform, not as a question mark hiding in plain sight, not as the girl who froze and then hated herself for it.

As Charli.

Celeste’s girl. Wardrobe’s girl. My own girl.

I reached across the narrow gap and curled my fingers around Sarah’s where they rested on the armrest.

“Ready?” she asked.

“No,” I said, heart hammering. “Yes. Both.”

“Perfect,” she said, giving my hand a squeeze. “There she is!”

As the plane dipped further and the world rose up to meet us, I pressed my forehead one more time against the humming window and let myself believe, properly, that I was exactly where I was meant to be: flying north with a woman I trusted at my side, another one waiting for me in a small, messy flat far below the clouds, and the next chapter of my life laid out somewhere between the coast and the hills, ready to be stitched. ✨

If you’d like, next pass we can:

* Dial *up* or *down* the X/Y paragraph depending on how overt you want that motif.
* Sharpen any of the “big” lines (final paragraph, “climbing rose,” “terrible first draft”) to match the exact level of understatement you want in a closing scene.
