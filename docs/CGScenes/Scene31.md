✨ The Brush ✨

Lauren arrived the way she did everything lately: fast, contained, already braced.

I heard her before I saw her—the firm knock that didn’t ask permission, the quick shift of keys, the familiar scrape of the latch. No hesitation. No dawdle at the threshold. She came in as if the doorway itself was something she could correct by force of will.

When she stepped into the kitchen, her eyes went briefly to me, then quickly to Charli.

Charli had been sitting in the same spot for too long, towel gripped like a security blanket, damp hair still uncombed, face raw from crying. She looked up when Lauren entered, and something in her expression rearranged itself—not relief exactly, not comfort.

More like recognition.

*This is the person who can actually undo me.*

Lauren crossed the room in three steps and stopped in front of her daughter.

For a second, she didn’t touch her.

That restraint—the pause before contact—was so precise it made my throat tighten. It was the kind of restraint you learned the hard way: the knowledge that sometimes touch feels like a verdict.

Then Lauren did what mothers do when they cannot afford theatre.

She cupped Charli’s cheek with her palm, thumb sliding once, gentle.

“You okay?” she asked. The words were soft. The question was not.

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I’m—” she started, then broke. “I didn’t—”

Lauren turned her head, just enough to look at me. Not accusing. Not grateful. Measuring.

I held her gaze.

“She’s safe,” I said. “She’s not in danger *right now*. But it can’t continue.”

Lauren’s hand stayed on Charli’s face. She didn’t stop touching her even while she processed the rest. That told me more than any sentence could have: whatever she was feeling, she wasn’t going to let her daughter be alone inside it.

Charli looked between us. Mother and me. Two women, two kinds of authority.

And there it was—the smallest, sharpest flicker in me.

Not anger. Not rivalry.

Something more primitive than either.

*Mine.*

Not in the possessive sense a man would claim, or a lover would claim, but in the sense that Wardrobe had trained me to feel about vulnerable things under my care: a duty that turned into ownership of outcome. Responsibility so fierce it bordered on jealousy.

I swallowed it before it could touch my face.

I did not want Charli to see it. I did not want Lauren to see it.

I wanted to be the adult.

Lauren’s gaze moved to the bottle. She didn’t pick it up. She didn’t read it again. She didn’t ask for more proof.

She simply nodded, once, and the nod was almost invisible—but it was a decision.

“How long?” she asked Charli.

Charli flinched. Her eyes slid away. “Almost four months.”

Lauren’s hand dropped from Charli’s cheek to her shoulder, firmer now. Anchoring.

“Four months,” Lauren repeated quietly, as if saying the number out loud would make it manageable.

Charli started to shake her head, quick, panicked. “Mum, I— I wasn’t— I didn’t do it because—”

Lauren cut in, not loud, but clean.

“Don’t explain it to me like I’m going to misunderstand,” she said. “I’m your mother. I know why you did it.”

Charli’s breath hitched. Something like shame flared and then collapsed.

Lauren kept her hand on her shoulder.

Then Lauren looked at me again.

“You took it off her,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” I said. “I’m holding it.”

Lauren’s face did something complicated—relief mixed with fear, as if she didn’t want to admit how grateful she was that someone else had been present for the first collision.

“Thank you,” she said, very quietly.

I nodded once. I didn’t soften. Not yet. Softness can become permission to fall apart, and I needed them both upright.

Charli’s eyes were bright. She looked between us again, like she couldn’t decide which failure she was meant to confess to first.

Lauren’s voice changed then, fractionally. Not gentler. More controlled.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to do this properly.”

Charli blinked. The phrase hit her like a threat.

Lauren glanced at the bottle again and then back to Charli.

“Not ‘properly’ as punishment,” she said. “Properly as in: safe.”

Charli swallowed. “It was safe. I— I checked—”

“No,” Lauren said. Still not loud. “You *read*. You didn’t *check*. You don’t have bloodwork. You don’t have a doctor. You don’t have anyone watching what it’s doing to you.”

Charli flinched at the word watching, as if it sounded like surveillance instead of care.

I understood that too well. I’d watched her in Wardrobe: how she responded to scrutiny like a person expecting to be judged.

Lauren looked at me again.

“She said she bought it online,” Lauren said.

“Yes,” I replied. “Scripted medication. No oversight. No labs. It’s not acceptable.”

Lauren inhaled through her nose, slow. Her jaw tightened.

Then she did something that made my chest tighten again.

She turned to Charli and said, very simply:

“Do you have more?”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No— I—” She hesitated. That hesitation was an answer.

Lauren’s face didn’t change.

Charli rushed, frantic. “No, I mean— I have— there’s— I have a second bottle, but it’s— it’s not— it’s for later—”

Lauren held up her hand. A stop sign made of flesh.

“Where,” she asked.

Charli’s breathing went shallow. Her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“In my room,” she whispered. “In the drawer.”

Lauren’s hand tightened on Charli’s shoulder—not painful, just firm.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to get it.”

Charli panicked. “Mum, please—”

Lauren’s voice stayed flat. “Charli.”

The name landed like a hand closing around a moving wrist.

Charli went still.

I watched her obey, and something in me loosened a fraction. Not comfort.

Recognition.

Lauren was the adult too. A real one. A woman who could hold a line without cruelty.

Lauren moved toward the hallway.

Charli looked at me, helpless.

The look did something sharp inside my ribs. It felt like being chosen in a way I hadn’t consented to. Like suddenly I was part of her definition of safety.

I kept my face steady.

“I’m coming,” I said, and followed.

---

Charli’s room was neat in that anxious way: things arranged, not lived in. The bed made too tightly. Clothes folded too carefully. The kind of order that came from fear of being criticised rather than pleasure in calm.

Lauren went straight to the dresser.

“Which drawer?” she asked.

Charli pointed without speaking.

Lauren opened it.

There it was: another white bottle, less empty than the first. A printed label that tried to make a dangerous thing look routine.

Lauren picked it up, held it a moment, and then—without looking at Charli—she slid it into her pocket.

Charli made a small sound that wasn’t quite a sob. More like a protest caught in the throat.

Lauren turned and faced her then.

“Listen to me,” she said. “You are not in trouble for wanting what you want.”

Charli blinked hard.

“You are in trouble,” Lauren continued, “for risking your body in secret.”

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I didn’t want it to stop.”

Lauren’s eyes softened, just slightly, and in that softness I saw the mother’s grief: the knowledge that her child had felt alone enough to do this.

Lauren’s voice lowered.

“Nothing that’s real,” she said, “requires you to hurt yourself to keep it.”

Charli crumpled on the edge of the bed, towel still clutched to her chest like a child. Her shoulders shook once.

I had to force my hands to stay at my sides.

Every instinct in me wanted to step forward, to touch her hair, to tuck it behind her ear, to do something small and intimate that would say: *I see you. I’ve seen you. I won’t unsee you.*

I did nothing.

Not because I didn’t want to.

Because I wanted it too much.

Lauren glanced at me then—not accusing, not territorial. Something else.

Awareness.

She could see it. Or she could see enough to suspect.

I held her gaze, steady, and gave her something she could work with: the practical.

“We need a plan for tomorrow,” I said. “Not vague. Not emotional. A list.”

Lauren nodded once, grateful for the handrail.

“Yes,” she said. “A list.”

Charli looked up, confused, watery-eyed. “Tomorrow?”

“Yes,” I said, and my voice softened without losing its edge. “Tomorrow.”

She flinched as if the word meant confiscation forever.

Lauren sat on the bed beside her—not quite touching, but close enough to be felt.

“Tomorrow,” Lauren said, “we make appointments.”

Charli swallowed. “What if they—”

“They won’t,” Lauren said sharply, then corrected herself into something calmer. “And if someone does, we change doctors. We’re not begging for dignity.”

Charli stared at her, stunned by the certainty.

I felt another flicker in me—admiration, yes, but also that jealous responsibility again.

Because it was *so* easy, watching Lauren, to imagine how Charli’s loyalty could split: mother on one side, me on the other. Two women offering structure. Two women claiming outcome.

Charli’s gaze did the thing again—back and forth between us.

I could almost see the question behind her eyes:

*Which one do I belong to?*

My throat tightened.

I swallowed it.

For now.

“We’ll start with your GP,” I said, and kept it simple. “Bloodwork. Baselines. Then referrals to someone who’s actually experienced. We don’t do this on vibes.”

Charli’s lips trembled, but her shoulders eased a fraction at the word baselines—as if numbers could soothe her, as if structure could be a substitute for fear.

Lauren nodded.

“Okay,” she said. “And until then?”

I didn’t look at Charli when I answered. I looked at Lauren. Adult to adult.

“Until then,” I said, “no more doses. We keep her safe. We watch for symptoms. We don’t guess.”

Charli’s face tightened.

Lauren’s hand found Charli’s forearm and squeezed.

“It’s not forever,” Lauren said to her. “It’s ‘until we can do it right.’”

Charli’s eyes filled again.

“But it was making the… the horrible feeling stop,” she whispered.

I felt that in my chest like a bruise. Because I understood something now that I hadn’t admitted to myself before:

Her happiness wasn’t a mood.

It was relief.

It was safety.

It was the easing of a long, private terror.

I stepped closer.

Not to touch her.

Just to be nearer.

“Charli,” I said, and my voice was slow. Careful. “I’m not taking your future away.”

She looked at me, searching.

“I’m taking *danger* away,” I said. “There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled. She nodded, but it was the nod of a person who didn’t fully believe life would keep its promises.

Lauren stood.

“I’m staying tonight,” she said, not asking.

Charli’s eyes widened. “Mum—”

“Not negotiable,” Lauren said, and then—softening, just a little—“I’m not leaving you alone with your fear.”

Charli’s shoulders shook again, and this time she let the tears come.

Lauren turned toward me.

“Thank you,” she said again. This time it had more weight.

I nodded.

And then, because honesty matters between women, because it’s the only thing that keeps power clean, I said:

“I care about her,” I said quietly. “More than I realised.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine.

She didn’t blink. She didn’t flinch.

She simply nodded, once—accepting the truth as data, not as drama.

“Good,” she said. “Then help me do this properly.”

It should have felt like relief.

Instead, the word *help* slid under my ribs and hooked itself there.

Because help, in this context, meant a future that included me.

A future that could ask more of me than I’d planned to give.

Charli looked between us again, tears on her cheeks, hair damp, face open and frightened.

And I felt that jealous responsibility rise again—quiet, fierce.

I swallowed it.

For now.

Tomorrow would give me lists and appointments and numbers to hold onto.

Tonight, I would hold my distance like a discipline.

And I would learn how long I could keep doing it.

## Scene 31 — “Lauren” (Celeste POV, past tense)

Lauren arrived the way she did everything lately: fast, contained, already braced.

I heard her before I saw her—the firm knock that didn’t ask permission, the quick shift of keys, the familiar scrape of the latch. No hesitation. No dawdle at the threshold. She came in as if the doorway itself was something she could correct by force of will.

When she stepped into the kitchen, her eyes went briefly to me, then quickly to Charli.

Charli had been sitting in the same spot for too long, towel gripped like a security blanket, damp hair still uncombed, face raw from crying. She looked up when Lauren entered, and something in her expression rearranged itself—not relief exactly, not comfort.

*This is the person who can actually undo me.*

Lauren crossed the room in three steps and stopped in front of her daughter.

Then Lauren did what mothers do when they cannot afford theatre.

She cupped Charli’s cheek with her palm, thumb sliding once, gentle.

“You okay?” she asked.

The words were soft. The question was not.

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I’m—” she started, then broke. “I didn’t—”

Lauren’s gaze flicked to me. Not accusing. Not grateful. Measuring.

I held it.

“She’s safe,” I said. “She’s not in immediate danger. But it can’t continue.”

Lauren didn’t take her hand away. She kept contact while she processed that sentence, as if touch was the only thing she trusted not to lie.

Charli looked between us. Mother and me. Two women, two kinds of authority.

And there it was—the smallest, sharpest flicker in me.

Not anger. Not rivalry.

Something more primal than either.

A responsibility so fierce it bordered on jealousy.

I swallowed it before it could touch my face.

Lauren’s eyes moved to the bottle on the counter.

She didn’t pick it up. She didn’t read it again. She didn’t ask for more proof.

She simply nodded once—almost invisible—and in that nod I felt the click of a decision.

“How long?” she asked Charli.

Charli flinched. Her eyes slid away. “Almost four months.”

“Four months,” Lauren repeated quietly, as if saying the number out loud would make it manageable.

Charli shook her head quickly. “Mum, I— I wasn’t— I didn’t do it because—”

Lauren cut in, not loud, but clean.

“Don’t explain it to me like I’m going to misunderstand,” she said. “I’m your mother. I—” Her voice snagged for a fraction. “I know you.”

The slip was small. The meaning wasn’t.

Her hand moved from Charli’s cheek to her shoulder, firmer now. Anchoring.

Then Lauren looked at me again.

“You took it,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” I said. “I secured it.”

Lauren’s face did something complicated—relief mixed with fear, as if she didn’t want to admit how grateful she was that someone else had been present for the first collision.

“Thank you,” she said, very quietly.

I nodded once.

Charli’s eyes were bright. She looked between us again, like she couldn’t decide which failure she was meant to confess to first.

Lauren’s voice changed then. Not gentler.

More controlled.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to do this properly.”

Charli blinked. The phrase hit her like a threat.

Lauren caught it. She adjusted—not softness, exactly, but calibration.

“Properly as in: safe,” she said. “Properly as in: supervised.”

Charli swallowed. “It *was* safe. I— I checked—”

“No,” Lauren said. Still not loud. “You *read*. You didn’t *check*. You don’t have bloodwork. You don’t have a doctor. You don’t have anyone watching what it’s doing to you.”

Charli flinched at the word watching, as if it sounded like surveillance instead of care.

I’d seen that flinch before. Scrutiny, to Charli, still felt like judgement.

Lauren’s jaw tightened. Her gaze went briefly unfocused—somewhere past the room, past the facts—then snapped back.

“This is…” she began, and I felt the denial reaching for language. “This is the environment. This is—”

Her eyes cut to me again. Quick, sharp. A flicker of accusation trying to find a home.

Then it died, because the logic wouldn’t hold.

I had called her.

I had put the bottle on the table and refused to pretend it was nothing.

Lauren inhaled through her nose, slow. Resetting.

“I’m not saying you did this,” she said, and it wasn’t an apology. It was an admission of the thought she didn’t want to own. “But I need to know if anyone has been… pushing her.”

“No one has been pushing her,” I said. My voice stayed low, steady. “Lauren, she did this because she was scared of what was starting in her body. That’s what she told me.”

Lauren’s eyes went back to Charli. Her grip on Charli’s shoulder tightened—not painful, just firm. Holding the line against panic.

Charli stared down at her towel.

Lauren’s voice dropped, and under it I heard that basso-continuo again—*How did I fail him?*—the old pronoun humming like a bruise.

“I thought…” Lauren said carefully. “I thought we had time. I thought we could let things settle.”

“I think you were trying to,” I said. “And I think she ran out of time in her own head.”

Silence.

In the kitchen’s bright stillness, the apartment felt like Wardrobe after hours—intentional, waiting.

Then Lauren did something that made my chest tighten again.

She turned to Charli and asked, very simply:

“Do you have more?”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No— I—” She hesitated.

That hesitation was an answer.

Lauren’s face didn’t change.

Charli rushed, frantic. “No, I mean— I have— there’s— I have a second bottle, but it’s— it’s not— it’s for later—”

Lauren lifted a hand. A stop sign made of flesh.

“Where,” she asked.

Charli’s breathing went shallow. Her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“In my room,” she whispered. “In the drawer.”

Lauren nodded once.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to get it.”

Charli panicked. “Mum, please—”

Lauren’s voice stayed flat. “Charli.”

The name landed like a hand closing around a moving wrist.

Charli went still.

Charli made a small sound that wasn’t quite a sob. More like a protest caught in the throat.

Lauren turned to face her.

“Listen to me,” she said. Not loud. Just absolute. “I’m not angry that you wanted relief.”

Charli blinked hard.

“I am angry,” Lauren went on, and her voice tightened on the word, “that you thought you had to do it alone.”

That landed.

It wasn’t punishment language. It was loneliness language.

Charli’s shoulders shook once.

I had to force my hands to stay at my sides.

Every instinct in me wanted to step forward, to touch her hair, to tuck it behind her ear, to do something small and intimate that would say: *I see you. I’ve seen you. I won’t unsee you.*

Not because I didn’t want to.

I didn’t look at Charli when I answered. I looked at Lauren. Adult to adult.

“Until then,” I said, “no more doses. We keep her safe. We watch for symptoms. We don’t guess.”

✨ The Brush ✨

Scene 31 — “Lauren” (Celeste POV, past tense)

I had put the bottle on the bench.

Lauren arrived the way she did everything lately: fast, contained, already braced.

I heard her before I saw her—the firm knock that didn’t ask permission, the quick shift of keys, the familiar scrape of the latch. No hesitation. No dawdle at the threshold. She came in as if the doorway itself was something she could correct by force of will.

“How long have you been taking these?” she asked Charli.

Charli flinched. Her eyes slid away. “Almost four months.”

“Four months,” Lauren repeated quietly, as if saying the number out loud would make it manageable.

Charli shook her head quickly. “Mum, I— I wasn’t— I didn’t do it because—”

Lauren cut in, not loud, but clean.

“Don’t explain it to me like I’m going to misunderstand,” she said. “I’m your mother. I—” Her voice snagged for a fraction. “I know you.”

The slip was small. The meaning wasn’t.

Charli flinched at the word 'watching', as if it sounded like surveillance. I’d seen that flinch before. Scrutiny, to Charli, would undoubtably still feel like judgement.

I shook my head. “No one has been *pushing* her, Lauren,” I said. My voice stayed low, steady. “Charli did this because she was scared of changes that were happening in her body. That’s what she has told me.”

Lauren’s eyes went back to Charli. Her grip on Charli’s shoulder tightened—not painful, just firm. Holding the line against panic. Charli stared down at her towel. Lauren’s voice dropped, and under it I heard that accusing thrum again—*How did I fail him?*—the old pronoun just under the surface, sore as a bruise.

“I thought...” Lauren said carefully. “I was going to..." She paused again "I thought we could let things settle.”

“I think Charli ran out of time in her head.”

Silence.

In the kitchen’s bright stillness, the apartment felt like Wardrobe after hours—intentional, waiting. And then, suddenly, Lauren turned to Charli.

“Do you have more?”

I hadn't even thought of that. Charli’s eyes widened. 

“No— I—” She hesitated.

That hesitation was an answer. Lauren’s face didn’t change. Charli rushed, frantic.

“No, I mean— I have— there’s— I have a second bottle, but it’s— it’s not— it’s for later—”

Lauren lifted a hand. A stop sign made of flesh.

“Where?”

Charli’s breathing went shallow. Her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“In my room,” she whispered. “In the drawer.” Charli went still. Lauren was the adult too. A real one. A woman who could hold a line without cruelty. As Lauren moved toward the hallway, Charli looked at me, helpless.

The look did something sharp inside my ribs. It felt like being chosen in a way I hadn’t consented to. Like suddenly I was part of her definition of safety. I kept my face steady.

“I’m coming,” I said softly, and followed.

---

Charli’s room was neat in that anxious way: things arranged, not lived in. The bed made too tightly. Clothes folded too carefully. The kind of order that came from fear of being criticised rather than pleasure in calm.

Lauren went straight to the dresser.

“Which drawer?”

Charli pointed without speaking. Lauren opened it. There it was: another white bottle, untouched. A printed label that tried to make a dangerous thing look routine. Lauren held it a moment. Then, without looking at Charli, she slid it into her pocket. Charli stared without seeing at the pocket. Lauren lifted her face by her chin.

“Listen to me, Charli” she said firmly. “I’m not upset that you wanted relief.”

Charli blinked hard.

“I just have a hard time,” Lauren went on, and her voice tightened on the word, “with the idea that you thought you had to do it alone. That you couldn't talk to me.”

That landed. Charli’s shoulders shook once.

I had to force my hands to stay at my sides. Every instinct in me wanted to step forward, to touch her hair, to tuck it behind her ear, to do something small and intimate that would say: *I see you. I’ve seen you. I won’t unsee you.*

I did nothing. I *couldn't*. Not because I didn’t want to.

Because I wanted to, *too much*.

Lauren glanced at me, the light of awareness in her eyes. I felt she could see it, see my restraint. Or at least, she could see enough to suspect. I held her gaze and gave her something she could use: the practical.

“We need a plan for tomorrow,” I said. “Not vague. A list.”

Lauren’s nod was immediate. Grateful for the handrail.

“Yes, I agreed,” she said. “A list.”

Charli looked up, confused, watery-eyed. “Tomorrow?”

“Yes,” I said, and my voice softened without losing its edge. “Tomorrow.”

She slumped down onto her bed. Lauren sat on the bed beside her, not quite touching, but close enough to be felt.

“Tomorrow, Charli,” Lauren said, “we make appointments.”

Charli swallowed. “What if they—”

“They won’t,” Lauren said sharply, then corrected herself into something calmer. “And if they do, we find someone else. We’re not begging anyone for your dignity.”

Charli stared at her, stunned by the certainty. I felt another flicker in me: admiration, yes, and that jealous responsibility again, quieter now, less sharp. Because it was so easy, watching Lauren, to imagine how Charli’s loyalty could split: mother on one side, me on the other. Two women offering structure. Two women claiming outcome.

Something in me snapped into place. Practical.

“We start with your GP,” I said, keeping it simple. “Bloodwork. Baselines. Then referrals to someone with a background, a specialist in the field. We don’t do this on vibes.”

Charli’s lips trembled, but her shoulders eased a fraction at the word baselines—as if numbers could soothe her, as if structure could stand in for fear. I stepped closer.

Not to touch her. Just to be nearer.

“Charli,” I said, and my voice was slow. Careful. “This is not about taking your future away.”

She looked at me, searching.

“We're taking *danger* away,” I said. “There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled. She nodded, but it was the nod of a person who didn’t fully believe life would keep its promises.

Lauren stood.

“I’m staying tonight,” she said, not asking.

Charli’s eyes widened. “Mum—”

“Not negotiable,” Lauren said, and then—softening, just a little—“I’m not leaving you alone with your fear.”

Charli’s shoulders shook again, and this time she let the tears come.

Lauren turned toward me.

“Thank you,” she said again. This time it had more weight.

I nodded. And then, because honesty matters between women—because it keeps power clean—I said what hadn't been articulated.

“I care about her,” I said quietly. “More than I realised.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine. She didn’t blink. She didn’t flinch. She simply nodded once—accepting the truth as data, not drama.

“Good,” she said. “Then please help me do this properly.”

It should have felt like relief. Instead, the word *help* slid under my ribs and hooked itself there. Because help, in this context, meant a future that included me. A future that could ask more of me than I’d planned to give.

Charli looked between us again, tears on her cheeks, hair damp, face open. The fright from early had largely eased. And I felt that fierce responsibility rise again—quiet, sharp, unmistakable.

I swallowed it.

For now.

Tomorrow would give me lists and appointments and numbers to hold onto. Tonight, I would hold my distance like a discipline. 

And realised with a razor-sharp clarity I was getting tired of holding my distance. 

I no longer saw a point to keep doing it.

## From Notes 26-01-25
### Lauren's Conflict 1

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116an.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

Lauren didn’t speak for a beat. When she did, it wasn’t panic. It was control so tight it squeaked.

“How did she get that.”

“On her own,” I said. “She sourced it herself.”

“That’s not an answer.” Her voice sharpened. “How does a child get anti-androgens on her own?”

“She’s seventeen,” I said gently, because this mattered. “And she’s smart. And she’s frightened.”

Another pause. Then the denial arrived, dressed as reason.

“So it’s the environment,” Lauren said. “It’s Wardrobe. Those girls—”

“It’s not them,” I said, steady. Not defensive. Certain. “They didn’t do this *to* her.”

Silence.

I kept my voice low. “Lauren… your child did this because she was scared of what was starting to happen in her body. She wasn’t playing. She wasn’t being dramatic. She was trying to stop something that made her feel sick.”

Lauren exhaled, thin and sharp, as if she’d been punched and didn’t want to admit it.

“You’re sure she’s not being… influenced.”

I didn’t answer the word. I answered the fear underneath it.

“I’m sure she’s been carrying this alone,” I said. “And I’m sure that ends tonight.”

Lauren’s voice shifted—subtly—toward accusation, then caught itself.

“You found it in her bag at your place.”

“Yes,” I said. No flinch. “And I’m calling you because I won’t hold a secret that can harm her.”

A beat.

“Are you taking it away?” Lauren asked.

“I’ve secured it,” I said. “Not as punishment. As safety. We need supervision—bloodwork, a clinician, a plan. Tomorrow.”

Lauren’s breath came through the line—ragged now, the first crack in her control.

“And what is she saying?” she asked. “What is she *calling* this?”

I chose my words carefully.

“She doesn’t have language for it yet,” I said. “But she knows what it felt like. She knows the direction her body was moving made her afraid.”

Lauren went quiet. When she spoke again, it was lower.

“My son—”

I closed my eyes briefly. Not from anger. From tenderness.

“Your child is here,” I said. “And she’s safe.”

There it was: the basso-continuo, humming beneath the line.

“I don’t understand how I didn’t see it,” Lauren said. “How I—” She stopped. Swallowed. “I thought I was giving him time.”

“I think you were,” I said. “And I think she ran out of time in her own head.”

Lauren’s voice tightened again, trying to regain its old shape.

“So what are you asking me to do.”

I didn’t soften it. I didn’t dramatise it.

“Come tonight,” I said. “And tomorrow, we start properly. Supervised. Together. No secrets.”

A pause.

Then, very quietly: “Is she… upset with me?”

The question broke my heart a little.

“No,” I said. “She’s scared. Mostly of losing the life she’s just started to breathe in.”

Lauren’s inhale hitched.

“Okay,” she said, on a long exhale. Not agreement yet—decision. “Okay. I’m coming.”

“She’s not alone,” I said.

“I’m on my way,” Lauren replied.

And the line went dead.

## Scene 31
### How We Do Safe [P]

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116at.jpg" style="float: right; width: 540px; margin-left: 20px" />

**Scene 31 — “Lauren” (Celeste POV, past tense)**

✨ How We Do Safe ✨

[Celeste]

I had put the bottle on the kitchen bench.

Lauren arrived the way she did everything lately: fast, contained, already braced.

I heard her before I saw her—the firm knock that didn’t ask permission, the quick shift of keys, the familiar scrape of the latch. No hesitation. No dawdle at the threshold. She came in as if the doorway itself was something she could correct by force of will.

When she stepped into the kitchen, her eyes went briefly to me, then quickly to Charli.

Charli had been sitting in the same spot for too long, towel gripped like a security blanket, damp hair still uncombed, face raw from crying. She looked up when Lauren entered, and something in her expression rearranged itself—not relief exactly, not comfort.

More like recognition.

*This is the person who can actually undo me.*

Lauren crossed the room in three steps and stopped in front of her daughter.

For a second, she didn’t touch her.

That restraint—the pause before contact—was so precise it made my throat tighten. It was the kind of restraint you learned the hard way: the knowledge that sometimes touch feels like a verdict. Then Lauren did what mothers do when they cannot afford theatre.

She cupped Charli’s cheek with her palm, thumb sliding once, gentle.

“You okay?”

The words were soft. The question was not.

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I’m—” she started, then broke. “I didn’t—”

Lauren’s gaze flicked to me. Not accusing. Not grateful. Measuring.

I held it.

“She’s safe,” I said. “She’s not in immediate danger. But it can’t continue.”

Lauren didn’t take her hand away. She kept contact while she processed that sentence, as if touch was the only thing she trusted not to lie.

Charli looked between us. Mother and me. Two women, two kinds of authority. And there it was—the smallest, sharpest flicker in me. Not anger or rivalry.

Something more primal than either: a responsibility so fierce it bordered on jealousy. I swallowed it before it could touch my face.

Lauren’s eyes moved to the bottle on the kitchen bench. She didn’t pick it up. She didn’t read it again. She didn’t ask for more proof. She simply nodded—and in that nod I felt the click of a decision.

“How long have you been taking these?”

Charli flinched. Her eyes slid away. “Almost four months.”

“Four months,” Lauren repeated quietly, as if saying the number out loud would make it manageable.

Charli shook her head quickly. “Mum, I— I wasn’t— I didn’t do it because—”

Lauren cut in, not loud, but clean.

“Don’t explain it to me like I’m going to misunderstand,” she said. “I’m your mother. I—” Her voice snagged for a fraction. “I know you.”

The slip was small. The meaning wasn’t. Her hand moved from Charli’s cheek to her shoulder, firmer now. Anchoring. Then Lauren looked at me again.

“You took it,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” I said. “I secured it.”

Lauren’s face did something complicated—relief mixed with fear, as if she didn’t want to admit how grateful she was that someone else had been present for the first collision.

“Thank you,” she said, very quietly.

I nodded once.

Charli’s eyes were bright. She looked between us again, like she couldn’t decide which failure she was meant to confess to first.

Lauren’s voice changed then. Not gentler.

More controlled.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to do this properly.”

Charli blinked. The phrase hit her like a threat. Lauren caught the look in her eyes. She adjusted—not softness, exactly, but calibration.

“Properly as in: safe,” she said. “Properly as in: supervised.”

Charli swallowed. “It *was* safe. I— I checked—”

“No,” Lauren said. Still not loud. “You *read*. You didn’t *check*. You don’t have bloodwork. You don’t have a doctor. You don’t have anyone watching what it’s doing to you.”

Charli flinched at the word watching, as if it sounded like surveillance. I’d seen that flinch before. Scrutiny, to Charli, still felt like judgement.

Lauren’s jaw tightened. Her gaze went briefly unfocused—somewhere past the room, past the facts—then snapped back.

“This is...” she began, and I felt the denial reaching for language. “This must be... the environment. This is—”

Her eyes cut to me again. Quick, sharp. A flicker of accusation trying to find a home. Then it died, because the logic wouldn’t hold.

I had called her.

I had pulled the bottle out into the open and refused to pretend it was nothing. Lauren inhaled through her nose, slow. Resetting.

“Look, I’m not saying you had anything to do with this,” she said, and it wasn’t an apology. It was an admission of the thought she didn’t want to own. “But... I need to know if someone— *anyone* —has been... pushing her.”

I shook my head. “No one has been *pushing* her, Lauren,” I said. My voice stayed low, steady. “Charli did this because she was scared of changes that were happening in her body. That’s what she has told me.”

Lauren’s eyes went back to Charli. Her grip on Charli’s shoulder tightened—not painful, just firm. Holding the line against panic. Charli stared down at her towel. Lauren’s voice dropped, and under it I heard that accusing thrum again—*How did I fail him?*—the old pronoun just under the surface, sore as a bruise.

“I thought...” Lauren said carefully. “I was going to..." She paused again "I thought we could let things settle.”

I looked Lauren in the eyes.

“I think Charli ran out of time in her head.”

Silence.

In the kitchen’s bright stillness, the apartment felt like Wardrobe after hours—intentional, waiting. And then, suddenly, Lauren turned to Charli.

“Do you have more?”

The question landed like a door I hadn’t known to lock. Charli’s eyes widened. 

“No— I—” She hesitated.

That hesitation was an answer. Lauren’s face didn’t change. Charli rushed, frantic.

“No, I mean— I have— there’s— I have a second bottle, but it’s— it’s not— it’s for later—”

Lauren lifted a hand. A stop sign made of flesh.

“Where?”

Charli’s breathing went shallow. Her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“In my room,” she whispered. “In the drawer.”

Charli went still.

Lauren was the adult too.

As Lauren moved toward the hallway, Charli looked at me, helpless. The look did something sharp inside my ribs. It felt like being chosen in a way I hadn’t consented to. Like suddenly I was part of her definition of safety. I kept my face steady.

“I’m coming,” I said softly, and followed.

---

Charli’s room was neat in that anxious way: things arranged, not lived in. The bed made too tightly. Clothes folded too carefully. The kind of order that came from fear of being criticised rather than pleasure in calm.

Lauren went straight to the dresser.

“Which drawer?”

Charli pointed without speaking. Lauren opened it. There it was: another white bottle, untouched. A printed label that tried to make a dangerous thing look routine. Lauren held it a moment. Then, without looking at Charli, she slid it into her pocket. Charli stared without seeing at the pocket. Lauren lifted her face by her chin.

“Listen to me, Charli” she said firmly. “I’m not upset that you wanted relief.”

Charli blinked hard.

“I just have a hard time,” Lauren went on, and her voice tightened on the word, “with the idea that you thought you had to do it alone. That you couldn't talk to me.”

That landed. Charli’s shoulders shook once.

I had to force my hands to stay at my sides. Every instinct in me wanted to step forward, to touch her hair, to tuck it behind her ear, to do something small and intimate that would say: *I see you. I’ve seen you. I won’t unsee you.*

I did nothing. I *couldn't*. Not because I didn’t want to—because I wanted to too much.

I caught Lauren glance in my direction. The light of awareness shone in her eyes. I felt she could see it, see my restraint. Or at least, she could see enough to suspect. I held her gaze and gave her something she could use: the practical.

“We need a plan for tomorrow,” I said. “Not vague. A list.”

Lauren’s nod was immediate, grateful for the handrail.

“Yes,” she said, and I could hear gratitude in her voice. “A list.”

Charli looked up, watery-eyed, weary. “Tomorrow?”

“Yes,” I said, and my voice softened without losing its edge. “Tomorrow.”

She slumped down onto her bed. Lauren sat on the bed beside her, not quite touching, but close enough to be felt.

“Tomorrow, Charli,” Lauren said tenderly, “we make appointments.”

Charli swallowed. “What if they—”

“They won’t,” Lauren said sharply, then corrected herself into something calmer. “And if they do, we find someone else. We’re not begging anyone for your dignity.”

Charli stared at her, stunned by the certainty. I felt another flicker in me: admiration, yes, and that jealous responsibility again, quieter now, less sharp. Because it was so easy, watching Lauren, to imagine how Charli’s loyalty could split: mother on one side, me on the other. Two women offering structure. Two women claiming outcome.

Something in me snapped into place. Again, practical.

“We start with your GP,” I said, keeping it simple. “Bloodwork. Baselines. Then referrals to someone with a background, a specialist in the field. We don’t do this on vibes.”

Charli’s lips trembled, but her shoulders eased a fraction at the word baselines—as if numbers could soothe her, as if structure could stand in for fear. I stepped closer.

Not to touch her. Just to be nearer.

“Charli,” I said, and my voice was slow. Careful. “This is not about taking your future away.” She looked at me, searching. “We're taking *danger* away,” I said. “There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled. She nodded, but it was the nod of a person who didn’t fully believe life would keep its promises.

Lauren stood.

“I’m staying tonight,” she said, not asking.

Charli’s eyes widened. “Mum—”

“Not negotiable,” Lauren said, and then—softening, just a little—“I’m not leaving you alone with your fear.”

Charli’s shoulders shook again, and this time she let the tears come.

Lauren turned toward me.

“Thank you,” she said again. This time it had more weight. I nodded. 

And then, because silence can be its own kind of manipulation, I let the truth out. Honesty matters between women.

“I care about her,” I said quietly. “More than I realised.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine. She didn’t blink. She didn’t flinch. She simply nodded once—accepting the truth as data, not drama.

“Good,” she said. “Then please help me do this properly.”

It should have felt like relief. Instead, the word *help* slid under my ribs and hooked itself there. Because help, in this context, meant a future that included me. Charli looked between us again, tears on her cheeks, hair damp, face open. The fright from earlier had largely eased. And I felt that fierce responsibility rise again—quiet, sharp, unmistakable.

I swallowed it.

For now.

Tomorrow would give me lists and appointments and numbers to hold onto. Tonight, I would hold my distance like a discipline. And yet, as Charli’s breathing slowed and the room softened around her, I felt it: the point of keeping that distance was growing obscure.

She didn’t need me far away to prove I was safe.

She needed me close enough to mean it.
