## From 25.01.05

## Scene Forty — “No Gossip, No Project” (Celeste POV)

Wardrobe after hours was a different building.

By day it was a machine: steam, voices, feet on timber, scissors biting through cloth with that soft, confident snick. By night it went still in a way that felt intentional, as if the worktables were holding their breath until morning.

I didn’t turn on all the lights. I never did. I left the room in its half-lit honesty—the tall lamps over the cutting table, the small task light by the machine, the rest in shadow. Enough to see clean lines. Not enough to invite drama.

Lauren arrived the way she always arrived: not rushing, not apologising for taking up space, not asking permission from a room she’d paid rent in a hundred times over by being the only adult in some situations. Canvas tote on her shoulder. Keys in her hand. That calm, measured face that said *I have already decided what matters.*

She looked past me, into the workroom, as if Charli might be hiding behind a dress form.

“He’s gone?” she asked.

“Home,” I said. “I made sure.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched—approval, disguised as neutrality. “Good.”

She came in and set her tote on a chair without moving anything else. Lauren never disrupted a system. She noted it, learned it, worked around it.

Then she finally looked at me properly.

“It’s not subtle,” she said.

I didn’t pretend not to know what she meant. “Lauren.”

“No.” She lifted her hand, palm out—not a shush, not a scold. A halt sign. “Let me finish. It’s not subtle, and it’s not nothing. He changes around you.”

The words weren’t accusatory, not exactly. But there was an edge to them, the way there was always an edge when someone was about to say *I’m worried you’re not seeing what you’re doing.*

My first impulse was irritation. Not at her. At the universe. At how quickly anything tender got interpreted as manipulation the moment a girl was the centre of it.

“He doesn’t need my permission to exist,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze didn’t wobble. “That’s not what I said.”

“It’s what people mean.” I moved to the cutting table and picked up the chalk that had been left out. I didn’t need it. I just needed my hands occupied, because otherwise my face would give me away. “Eventually. They always land there.”

Lauren walked a few steps farther in, stopping beside the table like she belonged there—because she did. “Alright,” she said quietly. “Then say it plain. What’s going on?”

I set the chalk down with more precision than necessary.

“I’m telling you,” I said, “because I’m not letting this become gossip.”

Lauren’s expression softened by a fraction. “Okay.”

“And I’m not letting it become a project.”

Her eyebrows rose. “Whose project?”

“Anyone’s. Even yours. Especially mine.” I exhaled, slow. “I can feel the room gearing up for a narrative. And if it turns into a narrative, Charli will get flattened under it.”

Lauren didn’t argue. She waited. That was one of her gifts: she could go still and make space without turning it into a performance.

I said, “He’s… oriented toward my standard.”

Lauren’s mouth opened as if to speak, then closed again. She tried another angle. “What does that mean, in English?”

“It means he watches me,” I said, “and he adjusts.”

“Because he likes you?”

I glanced up at her. “Don’t be simplistic.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed—not offended, just sharpening focus. “Then don’t be vague.”

Fair.

“He thinks he’s doing it for me,” I said. “Little things. How he stands. How he speaks. How careful he is. Like he’s trying to be the version of himself that won’t disappoint me.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked toward the doorway that led to the staff room, to the world where other people would take those words and turn them into something uglier. “And is he?”

I didn’t answer immediately. I considered the truth, the way it behaved in my mouth.

“I think,” I said slowly, “he’s doing it because it works.”

Lauren stared at me.

I continued, because once I’d started, stopping would be cowardice. “He’s calmer. He’s… steadier. He moves through the day like his nervous system isn’t being dragged by the throat.”

Lauren’s shoulders shifted, a subtle change—less suspicion, more understanding. “So it’s not… theatre.”

“No.” The word came out flat. “He isn’t putting on a show. He’s… finding an equilibrium.”

Lauren’s face did that thing it did when she was piecing together a pattern. “And you.”

I didn’t like how softly she said it. Like she was careful not to spook me.

“I have feelings,” I said. I made myself say it without flinching, without dressing it up. “That’s not the point. The point is that I’m not going to let those feelings set the terms.”

Lauren’s stare held. “Whose terms do you want?”

“His,” I said, immediately. “And ours. The workplace. The culture. The standards that keep people safe.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine for a long moment. “Celeste,” she said, “do you understand how easily this gets misread?”

“Yes.” I didn’t even have to think. “That’s why I’m talking to you.”

Lauren nodded once, almost imperceptibly. “Good.”

I turned my head slightly, listening without meaning to. The building’s old pipes made soft ticking noises as they cooled. Somewhere outside, a car passed on wet asphalt. Quiet. Ordinary. Nothing dramatic.

Lauren said, “So let me ask you the only question that matters.”

I looked at her.

“Is he doing it,” she said, “because he wants to be seen as good… or because it makes him feel like himself?”

My chest tightened—because that was it. That was the dividing line, and she’d found it without being told.

“He looks like he can breathe,” I said.

Lauren’s face shifted again, and this time it was unmistakable. She got it. Not in a sentimental way. In a structural way. Like a load-bearing beam had been moved into place.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Then we do this properly.”

“We do this quietly,” I corrected.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Quietly,” she agreed. “And with boundaries.”

I nodded. “And no one gets to treat him like content.”

Lauren’s gaze sharpened. “Including you.”

That would have been an insult from anyone else.

From Lauren, it was respect.

“I’m not stupid,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I let myself look away for a second, toward the dress forms lined up in the half-light—silent bodies waiting for meaning.

“He doesn’t know I can tell,” I said.

Lauren’s voice softened. “Of course he doesn’t.”

I frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means,” Lauren said, “he’s young. And you’re a girl who notices everything. He thinks he can tuck his heart under his sleeve and you won’t see the shape of it.”

My throat tightened again, but I refused to let it become softness.

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Operationally.”

Lauren exhaled. “I’m going to speak to someone,” she said. “Professionally. Not to diagnose him without him. To get a framing. To make sure we don’t accidentally harm him by doing the wrong right thing.”

I studied her. “And you’re going alone.”

Lauren nodded. “Yes. Because if you go, it becomes your story. And it can’t.”

I didn’t like how correct that was.

“Fine,” I said. “Go.”

Lauren reached for her keys again, then paused. “And Celeste?”

“Yes.”

“If your feelings are real,” she said carefully, “you’ll prove it by not taking anything from him that he hasn’t offered.”

My jaw tightened. “I don’t take.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Good. Keep it that way.”

When she left, the door clicked shut with a quiet finality that felt like a vow.

I stayed where I was, in the half-lit workroom, and I did the only thing that ever calmed me: I straightened what didn’t need straightening, made the world tidy, made the boundaries visible.

Because if Charli was going to name himself, he needed space to do it.

And I—whatever I wanted—was not going to be the reason he couldn’t.


<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

Yes — crystal clear now.

In *this* scene, **every “he / him / his” that refers to Charli** should be **she / her / hers**, because in your newer continuity Charli is socially/workplace-identified as **she/her**.

And no, you don’t need to go back for a context summary just for this fix. I can do the conversion cleanly from what you pasted. (If later you want me to check *timeline placement* or continuity beats, then a summary helps — but for pronouns alone, we’re fine.)

Below is your scene with **Charli fully she/her throughout**, while keeping Celeste and Lauren as she/her as well (so the whole scene is now “she/she/she” — which is fine, but it does mean clarity matters, and I’ve preserved your *Charli* name anchors where you already had them).

## Scene Forty — “No Gossip, No Project” (Celeste POV) — Charli set to she/her

---

If you’d like, I can also do a *second* pass that reduces the “she/she/she” density by swapping in **Charli’s name** in a few strategic places (so readers never have to do pronoun math). That’s optional — your current version is consistent now, but it’s *pronoun-heavy* by nature when all three are she/her.
