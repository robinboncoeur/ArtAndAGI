[26-01-22]

**Scene 40 — “No Questions First” (Lauren POV)**

When Sarah rings you at night, you answer.

Not because she’s fragile—Sarah is many things, but fragile isn’t one of them.

You answer because women who don’t ask for help until they *have* to are the ones who end up in trouble when they finally do.

I was in the kitchen when the call came in, rinsing a mug and thinking about nothing in particular. The sound of my phone was ordinary.

The reason for it wasn’t.

“Lauren?” Sarah’s voice was careful—too careful. Tight at the edges. Like she was trying to keep her pride from spilling into the call.

“Sarah,” I said. “Where are you?”

There was a pause, a swallow. “Near—” she named a street. A venue. A landmark. Bree’s name followed like a relief valve. “Bree’s with me.”

Good. One woman, at least.

“Stay where you are,” I said. “Sit down. Don’t go anywhere alone. I’m coming.”

“Thank you,” she said, as if she hated the words.

“No thanks,” I replied. “Just wait.”

I hung up, grabbed my keys, and sent one text to Celeste.

**Going to pick up Sarah + Bree. Will update.**

No explanation. Celeste didn’t need a story. She needed the fact.

On the way out I glanced at Charli’s shoes by the door—neatly placed, toes aligned—and felt the small, familiar pinch in my chest that came with seeing my child’s life overlapping someone else’s home.

Not my home. Not quite yet.

But safe enough.

That was the point.

I drove through the city with my jaw set and my hands steady on the wheel. Not because I was calm. Because I had practice. Motherhood trains you to turn panic into logistics.

I thought, briefly, of the folder on my phone—screenshots, dates, times. The unromantic evidence of a woman being asked to manage a man’s feelings.

I didn’t need the details to know the shape of it.

You could tell the shape from the call alone.

*Help, but don’t make me beg.*

When I pulled up, I spotted them immediately.

Bree on a bench, arm around Sarah’s shoulders, posture angled outward like a shield. Sarah sitting upright, chin lifted, eyes too bright in the streetlight. She looked… competent and unwell at the same time, which is a particular kind of danger.

I parked, got out, and walked over without running. If I ran, it became drama. If it became drama, Sarah would recoil.

“Hi,” I said, as if this were nothing more than a late pick-up from the airport.

Bree stood first. “Hey,” she replied, brisk and grateful. “She’s okay. Just… overloaded.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, assessing. Expecting judgement. Expecting *mum voice.*

She got something else.

“Okay,” I said. “Let’s get you home.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened. “I can—”

“No,” I said, not unkind. “You can’t. Not tonight. Not safely.”

The word safely wasn’t a reprimand. It was a standard. Something you either met or you didn’t.

Sarah swallowed. Then she nodded once, small.

Bree opened the back door. Sarah moved toward it, but her steps weren’t as precise as her pride wanted them to be. Bree steadied her without fuss.

I waited until Sarah was seated before I spoke again.

“Seatbelt,” I said, calm.

Sarah clicked it, cheeks flushing.

Bree slid into the front passenger seat. I got in, shut the door, and took a breath.

Only then did I ask the first question.

“Is he contacting you right now?” I asked, keeping my eyes on the road as I pulled away.

Sarah’s laugh was dry. “That’s your first question.”

“Yes,” I said. “Because that’s the only one that matters this minute.”

Bree angled her phone toward me. “Blocked calls,” she said. “A few.”

I nodded once, already making a mental list.

“Good,” I said. “We’ll document. You don’t answer.”

Sarah leaned her head back against the seat, eyes closed for a moment. “I didn’t,” she muttered. “I didn’t answer.”

“I know,” I said. “You called me.”

That, apparently, was the right thing to say, because Sarah’s throat moved and she didn’t speak for a few seconds.

Bree glanced at her, then looked forward again, jaw tight.

“He’s not Ethan,” Bree said. “Tonight was… a different one.”

I felt my stomach go cold.

“Different one,” I repeated, keeping my voice steady.

Bree nodded. “Some bloke. Grabby. The usual. We left.”

Sarah spoke then, voice low. “I said no. He acted like I’d flirted.”

Of course he did.

I kept my eyes on the road. There were two things I could do right now: give empathy, or give stability.

Sarah needed stability.

“Okay,” I said. “So: two problems. One, the ex. Two, the world.”

Bree barked a laugh. Sarah’s mouth twitched, almost despite herself.

“Lucky me,” Sarah muttered.

“Not luck,” I said, and let the steel in my voice come through. “Patterns. We deal with patterns.”

I pulled up at Bree’s building, because that’s where Sarah needed to be tonight: somewhere she wouldn’t feel hunted, somewhere she wouldn’t have to walk from car to door alone while her brain did ugly arithmetic.

Bree got out first, opened Sarah’s door, offered an arm.

Sarah hesitated, pride flaring.

I cut it off clean.

“Sarah,” I said, quiet. “Don’t be brave at the wrong time.”

She stared at me for a beat. Then, grudgingly, she took Bree’s arm and stepped out.

Inside, Bree’s place was small and warm—women’s clutter, shoes kicked off, a throw blanket draped like an afterthought. Bree guided Sarah to the couch and handed her a glass of water with the calm authority of someone who has done triage.

I sat opposite them and opened my phone.

“All right,” I said. “We do boring now.”

Sarah squinted. “Boring.”

“Yes,” I replied. “Screenshots. Dates. Times. Building manager log. One clean statement. No essays.”

Bree hovered behind the couch, arms folded. “I love you,” she told me, deadpan.

Sarah groaned. “Please don’t.”

I ignored both of them and held my phone out.

“Sarah,” I said. “Send me the message thread.”

Sarah stiffened. “Why?”

“Because if you’re rattled,” I said evenly, “you might answer by accident. Or delete something out of shame. Or forget a detail you’ll need later. I’m not letting your nervous system do admin.”

Sarah stared at me, then exhaled sharply.

“Fine,” she muttered. “God.”

“Thank you,” I replied, and waited.

Sarah unlocked her phone, scrolled, and began forwarding screenshots. Each one landed in my messages like a pebble in a jar—small, ordinary, cumulative.

Ethan’s language was exactly what I expected.

You can’t do this to me.
Stop being dramatic.
I just need to talk.
I’m outside.

None of it technically violent.

All of it coercive.

A man trying to turn “no” into “not yet.”

I felt my mouth go tight.

I made a folder.

**Sarah — Ethan — Jan**

Then another:

**Venue incident — notes**

Not because I wanted to build a case tonight.

Because I wanted Sarah to know—without me saying it—that this wasn’t chaos.

It was manageable.

Sarah watched my hands moving with a kind of exhausted relief that made my chest ache. She didn’t want to be mothered.

She wanted the world to be structured again.

Bree crouched beside her on the couch and spoke softly.

“You did the right thing calling Lauren,” Bree said.

Sarah snorted. “I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grinned. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

Sarah’s laugh cracked into something almost real. Then she rubbed her face with both hands, sudden vulnerability slipping through.

“I’m so tired,” she said, and the words were barely audible.

I didn’t soften into pity. Pity makes women smaller. Sarah would rather crawl out of her skin.

So I gave her something else.

A plan.

“Okay,” I said. “Tonight: you sleep here. Bree stays with you. Phone on Do Not Disturb. If he calls, you do nothing. If he shows up, you do not engage. You call police. Period.”

Sarah’s eyes flashed. “That’s dramatic.”

“It’s not dramatic,” I said. “It’s procedure.”

The word procedure landed like a handrail. Sarah’s shoulders lowered by a fraction.

“Tomorrow,” I continued, “we update your building manager. We confirm he’s not allowed entry. We take your documentation and we file what needs filing. And if he appears at Wardrobe, you do not handle it alone.”

Sarah blinked. “He wouldn’t—”

“He might,” I said. “Men like this confuse public space with entitlement space. We don’t assume good behaviour.”

Bree nodded sharply. “Mara will eat him.”

“With a fork,” I said.

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. Then, finally, her voice went small—rare for her.

“Okay,” she said.

Not “fine.”

Not “whatever.”

Okay.

I stood.

“I’ll check on you in the morning,” I said. “And Sarah?”

She looked up.

I held her gaze and made the sentence as plain as a ledger entry.

“This isn’t your fault.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened, reflexively allergic to comfort.

“I know,” she said.

I didn’t let it slide.

“No,” I repeated, quiet and firm. “Really know.”

Something in her face shifted—anger, grief, exhaustion—then settled.

“I know,” she said again, and this time it sounded like she was trying to believe it.

“Good,” I said. “Because you’re not going to carry his behaviour like it’s your responsibility.”

Sarah swallowed. She nodded once.

Bree reached for her hand and squeezed it.

I left them there—two women on a couch, one holding, one being held—because that was the whole point of the network.

Not rescue.

Not melodrama.

Just women refusing to let another woman be alone in a moment that could have tipped her into danger.

On the drive home, my phone buzzed once.

A text from Celeste.

**All okay?**

I replied without stopping at a red light, because some things mattered more than traffic etiquette.

**Sarah safe. Bree with her. Ex escalating; we’re going formal. Will brief Mara tomorrow.**

I put the phone down.

The streetlights slid past.

And I felt, with a strange, steady clarity, the way all of this rhymed.

Charli. Sarah. Bree. Celeste. Mara.

Different stories, same pattern: women tightening the net under one another, quietly, methodically, refusing to let male entitlement be the unchallenged weather of their lives.

Tomorrow, we’d do the boring things again.

Paperwork. Logs. Rules.

The unglamorous machinery of women making the world safe enough to live in.

And I would do it without apology.

## From 25.01.05

## Scene Forty — “No Gossip, No Project” (Celeste POV)

Wardrobe after hours was a different building.

By day it was a machine: steam, voices, feet on timber, scissors biting through cloth with that soft, confident snick. By night it went still in a way that felt intentional, as if the worktables were holding their breath until morning.

I didn’t turn on all the lights. I never did. I left the room in its half-lit honesty—the tall lamps over the cutting table, the small task light by the machine, the rest in shadow. Enough to see clean lines. Not enough to invite drama.

Lauren arrived the way she always arrived: not rushing, not apologising for taking up space, not asking permission from a room she’d paid rent in a hundred times over by being the only adult in some situations. Canvas tote on her shoulder. Keys in her hand. That calm, measured face that said *I have already decided what matters.*

She looked past me, into the workroom, as if Charli might be hiding behind a dress form.

“He’s gone?” she asked.

“Home,” I said. “I made sure.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched—approval, disguised as neutrality. “Good.”

She came in and set her tote on a chair without moving anything else. Lauren never disrupted a system. She noted it, learned it, worked around it.

Then she finally looked at me properly.

“It’s not subtle,” she said.

I didn’t pretend not to know what she meant. “Lauren.”

“No.” She lifted her hand, palm out—not a shush, not a scold. A halt sign. “Let me finish. It’s not subtle, and it’s not nothing. He changes around you.”

The words weren’t accusatory, not exactly. But there was an edge to them, the way there was always an edge when someone was about to say *I’m worried you’re not seeing what you’re doing.*

My first impulse was irritation. Not at her. At the universe. At how quickly anything tender got interpreted as manipulation the moment a girl was the centre of it.

“He doesn’t need my permission to exist,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze didn’t wobble. “That’s not what I said.”

“It’s what people mean.” I moved to the cutting table and picked up the chalk that had been left out. I didn’t need it. I just needed my hands occupied, because otherwise my face would give me away. “Eventually. They always land there.”

Lauren walked a few steps farther in, stopping beside the table like she belonged there—because she did. “Alright,” she said quietly. “Then say it plain. What’s going on?”

I set the chalk down with more precision than necessary.

“I’m telling you,” I said, “because I’m not letting this become gossip.”

Lauren’s expression softened by a fraction. “Okay.”

“And I’m not letting it become a project.”

Her eyebrows rose. “Whose project?”

“Anyone’s. Even yours. Especially mine.” I exhaled, slow. “I can feel the room gearing up for a narrative. And if it turns into a narrative, Charli will get flattened under it.”

Lauren didn’t argue. She waited. That was one of her gifts: she could go still and make space without turning it into a performance.

I said, “He’s… oriented toward my standard.”

Lauren’s mouth opened as if to speak, then closed again. She tried another angle. “What does that mean, in English?”

“It means he watches me,” I said, “and he adjusts.”

“Because he likes you?”

I glanced up at her. “Don’t be simplistic.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed—not offended, just sharpening focus. “Then don’t be vague.”

Fair.

“He thinks he’s doing it for me,” I said. “Little things. How he stands. How he speaks. How careful he is. Like he’s trying to be the version of himself that won’t disappoint me.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked toward the doorway that led to the staff room, to the world where other people would take those words and turn them into something uglier. “And is he?”

I didn’t answer immediately. I considered the truth, the way it behaved in my mouth.

“I think,” I said slowly, “he’s doing it because it works.”

Lauren stared at me.

I continued, because once I’d started, stopping would be cowardice. “He’s calmer. He’s… steadier. He moves through the day like his nervous system isn’t being dragged by the throat.”

Lauren’s shoulders shifted, a subtle change—less suspicion, more understanding. “So it’s not… theatre.”

“No.” The word came out flat. “He isn’t putting on a show. He’s… finding an equilibrium.”

Lauren’s face did that thing it did when she was piecing together a pattern. “And you.”

I didn’t like how softly she said it. Like she was careful not to spook me.

“I have feelings,” I said. I made myself say it without flinching, without dressing it up. “That’s not the point. The point is that I’m not going to let those feelings set the terms.”

Lauren’s stare held. “Whose terms do you want?”

“His,” I said, immediately. “And ours. The workplace. The culture. The standards that keep people safe.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine for a long moment. “Celeste,” she said, “do you understand how easily this gets misread?”

“Yes.” I didn’t even have to think. “That’s why I’m talking to you.”

Lauren nodded once, almost imperceptibly. “Good.”

I turned my head slightly, listening without meaning to. The building’s old pipes made soft ticking noises as they cooled. Somewhere outside, a car passed on wet asphalt. Quiet. Ordinary. Nothing dramatic.

Lauren said, “So let me ask you the only question that matters.”

I looked at her.

“Is he doing it,” she said, “because he wants to be seen as good… or because it makes him feel like himself?”

My chest tightened—because that was it. That was the dividing line, and she’d found it without being told.

“He looks like he can breathe,” I said.

Lauren’s face shifted again, and this time it was unmistakable. She got it. Not in a sentimental way. In a structural way. Like a load-bearing beam had been moved into place.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Then we do this properly.”

“We do this quietly,” I corrected.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Quietly,” she agreed. “And with boundaries.”

I nodded. “And no one gets to treat him like content.”

Lauren’s gaze sharpened. “Including you.”

That would have been an insult from anyone else.

From Lauren, it was respect.

“I’m not stupid,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I let myself look away for a second, toward the dress forms lined up in the half-light—silent bodies waiting for meaning.

“He doesn’t know I can tell,” I said.

Lauren’s voice softened. “Of course he doesn’t.”

I frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means,” Lauren said, “he’s young. And you’re a girl who notices everything. He thinks he can tuck his heart under his sleeve and you won’t see the shape of it.”

My throat tightened again, but I refused to let it become softness.

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Operationally.”

Lauren exhaled. “I’m going to speak to someone,” she said. “Professionally. Not to diagnose him without him. To get a framing. To make sure we don’t accidentally harm him by doing the wrong right thing.”

I studied her. “And you’re going alone.”

Lauren nodded. “Yes. Because if you go, it becomes your story. And it can’t.”

I didn’t like how correct that was.

“Fine,” I said. “Go.”

Lauren reached for her keys again, then paused. “And Celeste?”

“Yes.”

“If your feelings are real,” she said carefully, “you’ll prove it by not taking anything from him that he hasn’t offered.”

My jaw tightened. “I don’t take.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Good. Keep it that way.”

When she left, the door clicked shut with a quiet finality that felt like a vow.

I stayed where I was, in the half-lit workroom, and I did the only thing that ever calmed me: I straightened what didn’t need straightening, made the world tidy, made the boundaries visible.

Because if Charli was going to name himself, he needed space to do it.

And I—whatever I wanted—was not going to be the reason he couldn’t.


<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

Yes — crystal clear now.

In *this* scene, **every “he / him / his” that refers to Charli** should be **she / her / hers**, because in your newer continuity Charli is socially/workplace-identified as **she/her**.

And no, you don’t need to go back for a context summary just for this fix. I can do the conversion cleanly from what you pasted. (If later you want me to check *timeline placement* or continuity beats, then a summary helps — but for pronouns alone, we’re fine.)

Below is your scene with **Charli fully she/her throughout**, while keeping Celeste and Lauren as she/her as well (so the whole scene is now “she/she/she” — which is fine, but it does mean clarity matters, and I’ve preserved your *Charli* name anchors where you already had them).

## Scene Forty — “No Gossip, No Project” (Celeste POV) — Charli set to she/her

“We do this quietly,” I corrected.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Quietly,” she agreed. “And with boundaries.”

I nodded. “And no one gets to treat her like content.”

Lauren’s gaze sharpened. “Including you.”

That would have been an insult from anyone else.

From Lauren, it was respect.

“I’m not stupid,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I let myself look away for a second, toward the dress forms lined up in the half-light—silent bodies waiting for meaning.

“She doesn’t know I can tell,” I said.

Lauren’s voice softened. “Of course she doesn’t.”

I frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means,” Lauren said, “she’s young. And you’re a girl who notices everything. She thinks she can tuck her heart under her sleeve and you won’t see the shape of it.”

My throat tightened again, but I refused to let it become softness.

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Operationally.”

Lauren exhaled. “I’m going to speak to someone,” she said. “Professionally. Not to diagnose her without her. To get a framing. To make sure we don’t accidentally harm her by doing the wrong right thing.”

I studied her. “And you’re going alone.”

Lauren nodded. “Yes. Because if you go, it becomes your story. And it can’t.”

I didn’t like how correct that was.

“Fine,” I said. “Go.”

Lauren reached for her keys again, then paused. “And Celeste?”

“Yes.”

“If your feelings are real,” she said carefully, “you’ll prove it by not taking anything from her that she hasn’t offered.”

My jaw tightened. “I don’t take.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Good. Keep it that way.”

When she left, the door clicked shut with a quiet finality that felt like a vow.

I stayed where I was, in the half-lit workroom, and I did the only thing that ever calmed me: I straightened what didn’t need straightening, made the world tidy, made the boundaries visible.

Because if Charli was going to name herself, she needed space to do it.

And I—whatever I wanted—was not going to be the reason she couldn’t.

---

If you’d like, I can also do a *second* pass that reduces the “she/she/she” density by swapping in **Charli’s name** in a few strategic places (so readers never have to do pronoun math). That’s optional — your current version is consistent now, but it’s *pronoun-heavy* by nature when all three are she/her.
