**Scene 47 — “The Floodgates” (Celeste POV)**

It started the way most dangerous things start.

Quietly.

We were in the kitchen after dinner, the apartment dim and ordinary, the kind of evening that didn’t feel like it was making history. The kettle had clicked off a minute ago. The sink was full of dishes we would both pretend we didn’t see for ten minutes.

Charli was at the table with the ledger notebook open—not Wardrobe’s ledger, *hers*: the small private one where she copied recipes, wrote lists, rehearsed the shapes of competence the way other people rehearsed speeches.

She had her hair up, still damp from her shower. No cap, no kerchief, no pinned discipline—just herself. A girl in a t-shirt with a pen in her hand, trying to be useful in the only way she knew how: by preparing.

I leaned on the counter and watched her without meaning to.

I didn’t *intend* to be like this.

I’d told myself a hundred times: keep it clean. Keep it professional. Keep it safe. I’d been good at that. I’d built it into my bones the way I’d built Wardrobe’s rules into my mouth: calm voice, clear line, no ambiguity.

But somewhere over the last weeks, that discipline had started to cost me.

Because Charli wasn’t a project anymore.

She wasn’t “an interesting case.”

She wasn’t even “my responsibility.”

She was… *mine*, in a way my body understood before my mind allowed it.

She looked up and caught me looking.

Her smile arrived softly, like it had to be earned.

“You’re thinking,” she said.

“I’m always thinking,” I replied.

Charli’s eyes warmed—no argument, no flinch. She went back to her notebook, and I realised what I was actually watching: her hands.

Long-fingered. Careful. Precise. A person who touched paper the way she touched fabric: as if it had feelings.

I said, mostly to give myself something to do, “Show me what you’re writing.”

Charli hesitated—a small, old reflex of fear—then she slid the notebook toward me. Not defensive. Not secretive. Just offering.

I walked around to the table and leaned in to read.

A list.

Simple.

**GP appointment**
**bloods**
**script pick-up**
**hair pins (more)**
**salt (for pasta water)**
**thank Lauren?** (crossed out, then rewritten: **tell Lauren.**)

My chest tightened at that last line. Not because of Lauren. Because of the way Charli kept learning: not theatrically. Not with speeches. With small corrections. With practice.

I tapped the page lightly.

“This is good,” I said.

Charli’s shoulders lifted and lowered, a quiet exhale.

“I don’t want to forget,” she murmured.

“You won’t,” I said, and then—without planning to—added, “You’re not alone.”

Charli went still.

Not frightened. Not startled.

Just… struck.

Her eyes came up to mine, wide and bright, and for a moment she looked so young I felt something inside me soften dangerously.

She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to.

The wanting in her face was not sexual. It was worse than that.

It was trust.

It was devotion.

It was the look of someone who had been starving and didn’t quite believe food was allowed.

I should have looked away.

I didn’t.

Charli’s hand lifted—slow, tentative—as if she was asking permission from the air.

She reached toward my wrist where it rested on the table.

I felt the pause in her fingers before contact: that careful millimetre where she waited to see if I would pull away.

I didn’t.

Her fingertips touched my skin.

And my whole body reacted as if she’d turned on a light.

It wasn’t heat. Not exactly.

It was… relief.

Touch so gentle it didn’t feel like a claim. Touch so careful it felt like reverence. The smallest pressure, a feather of contact, but it landed inside me like certainty.

Charli’s thumb made one slow, tentative stroke across the inside of my wrist.

I inhaled sharply.

Charli froze, immediately—eyes flashing with panic.

“Sorry—” she began.

“No,” I said, too fast.

The word came out rougher than I intended.

Charli’s mouth closed. She watched my face, braced for correction, for withdrawal, for the old rules.

I forced myself to slow down.

“Don’t apologise,” I said, quieter. “Just… don’t stop.”

Charli’s eyes widened.

A flush rose in her cheeks, soft and disbelieving.

“Are you sure?” she whispered.

I hated how much I needed her to do it again.

“Yes,” I said, flat, because if I tried to make it pretty I’d lose control. “I’m sure.”

Charli’s hand returned, slower this time, as if she was learning me the way she learned fabric: testing tension, reading response, adjusting.

Her thumb traced the same small stroke again.

My skin prickled. My throat tightened. Something in my chest gave way with a quiet, internal sound—like a knot finally untying.

I had spent so long holding myself back—out of caution, out of responsibility, out of fear of becoming the kind of woman who takes what she wants without considering the cost.

But this didn’t feel like taking.

It felt like being met.

I looked down at her hand on mine and realised, with a shock that was almost comic, that Charli’s touch was not demanding.

It was offering.

Which made my own hunger feel unbearable.

I turned my palm over, slowly, and let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not possessive.

Just… answering.

Charli’s breath hitched.

Her eyes shone, the way they did when she wanted to cry but refused to perform it.

“Celeste,” she whispered, like my name was a place.

I swallowed.

“This,” I said, trying to make my voice steady, “is not a reward.”

Charli blinked.

“It’s not something you earn by being good,” I continued. “Do you understand me?”

Her expression shifted—confused, then dawning.

“You mean…” she began.

“I mean,” I said, and my voice softened despite myself, “I want it too.”

Charli’s lips parted slightly, stunned.

I could have left it there. I should have.

Instead, I leaned down—slowly, deliberately—and kissed her.

Not hungry.

Not urgent.

A small kiss, precise as a pin placed correctly. A kiss that asked a question and waited for the answer.

Charli answered by making the smallest sound in her throat and lifting her free hand to my waist—light, careful, as if she was afraid I’d dissolve.

Her touch there was just as gentle.

And it nearly undid me.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead lightly against hers.

“Touch,” I murmured, the word half a confession. “That’s all I want tonight.”

Charli nodded quickly, almost frantic with relief.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can—yes.”

I guided her up from the table and toward the couch. We sat, close, and she curled against me with the cautious joy of someone waiting for the rules to change back.

They didn’t.

I wrapped an arm around her and let her settle.

Charli’s hand slid along my forearm, then my shoulder, then my collarbone—each touch a question, each pause a check-in.

It was unbearably sweet.

It was… bliss, in the simplest sense: my body unclenching, my mind quieting, the world narrowing to the fact of her presence.

Charli kissed my cheek once, then my jaw, then—very carefully—my throat, as if she’d learned I might break there.

I closed my eyes.

The floodgates opened with no drama at all.

Just a steady, unstoppable softness.

And in the dark, held by the gentlest hands I’d ever known, I realised the truth I’d been skirting for months:

I wasn’t losing control.

I was finally allowing myself to be loved.

[26-02-16]

The next morning the flat smelled like coffee and last night’s rosemary.

Charli was already at Wardrobe; she’d crept out quietly, kissed my shoulder, and whispered something about “bolts arriving early” before the front door clicked. Mum emerged from the spare room dressed like she was heading straight to work: dark trousers, clean shirt, hair pinned so precisely I felt underdressed just looking at her.

“You sleep?” I asked, handing her a mug.

“Enough,” she said. “The bed’s fine. Your towels are passable.”

High praise.

We did the small things—dishwasher, windows, a quick check that she hadn’t left anything in the bathroom—and then it was just keys in my hand and her suitcase back by the door.

“I’ve got a short-term lease near the salon,” she said as we got to the car. “One of those furnished boxes they call an apartment.”

“Luxury shoebox,” I said. “Very Melbourne.”

The Swift waited at the kerb, sun already warming the faded red paint. It was ten years old, a little scratched, utterly reliable. The interior smelled faintly of fabric dust and coffee, with a baseline of machine oil from the many times I’d parked it behind Wardrobe.

Mum paused by the bonnet, fingers brushing the badge.

“So he did buy you a decent car,” she said.

“Technically,” I replied, opening my door. “He wired the money and told me to choose something sensible. I ignored ‘sensible’ and chose something small and cute instead. The dealer did the rest.”

“He would have enjoyed feeling generous,” she said, getting in. “You may as well enjoy the result.”

I turned the key. The engine caught with its familiar little cough and then settled, obedient. I pulled out into the street, the indicator ticking like a metronome.

For a while we just drove, letting the city wake up around us. School traffic, tradie utes, a tram dinging half-heartedly at someone who’d blocked the tracks.

“How long have you been in love with her?” Mum asked, eventually, as if she were asking about the weather.

I checked my mirrors. “Going straight or turning left?” I said.

“Answer the question and I’ll tell you,” she replied.

I huffed out a breath and waited for the lights.

“I don’t know,” I said. “It wasn’t a lightning bolt. More like… I looked up one day and realised she’d quietly moved into every room.”

“Hmm,” Mum said. “That happens.”

The light changed. I drove on.

“She moved in as a practicality,” I added. “Remember? Rents were stupid. She needed a place, I had space. It was supposed to be temporary.”

“Temporary,” Mum repeated. “Right. And at what point did ‘temporary housemate’ become ‘woman you share a bed with’?”

I could feel the heat rise in my cheeks, which was annoying. “Probably somewhere between her learning where everything goes in the kitchen and me panicking when she didn’t text that she’d got home from work.”

“So fairly early,” Mum said, unbothered. “And does she know that?”

“I don’t do unrequited,” I said. “It’s inefficient.”

She gave me a small, sideways smile. “No. You don’t.”

We turned onto a bigger road. The traffic picked up; so did her questions.

“When did she start… changing?” Mum asked, choosing her word carefully but without flinching.

“Physically, you mean?” I said.

“That, and otherwise.”

I thought about it. “She was already changing when I met her,” I said. “She just hadn’t drawn the line to the right place yet.”

Mum arched an eyebrow. “Meaning?”

“Meaning,” I said, “that by the time we shared a bathroom, she’d already been on the wrong medications for years, had a body that didn’t behave like the boys around her, and was doing that thing where you pretend you’re just ‘a bit different’ instead of asking if you might actually be something else entirely.”

“And you,” Mum said, “just happened to be on hand with a label.”

“That makes it sound like I slapped a sticker on her forehead,” I said.

“Didn’t you?” There was no accusation in it. Just curiosity.

I tightened my grip on the wheel for a moment, then forced my fingers to relax. “No,” I said. “I asked questions. The same ones you asked me when I told you I wasn’t interested in men. ‘How long have you felt like this?’ ‘Does it feel like relief when you say it out loud?’ ‘Does the word fit or are you forcing it because it’s there?’”

Mum looked out the window, watching a cyclist weave between cars. “And?”

“And every time she tried to say she was a boy, she looked like she was putting on someone else’s coat,” I said. “Too heavy, wrong cut, wouldn’t fasten. When she let herself imagine ‘girl,’ she… softened. Not weaker. Just more… accurate.”

Mum made a thoughtful sound. “Accurate is good.”

I nodded. “I told her I’d rather have an accurate girl than an inaccurate boy taking up space in my bed.”

She snorted softly. “Trust you to make it sound like a paperwork error.”

We drove in silence for a bit. The indicator ticked again as I changed lanes.

“Do you ever worry,” Mum said eventually, “that you’re re-running my marriage in reverse?”

I blinked. “Meaning?”

“Meaning,” she said, “you’re the one with the plan, the car, the degree in progress, the income that doesn’t vanish if someone sneezes at the stock market. She’s the one trailing half a step behind, trying to keep up with your stride.”

“That’s not fair,” I said, automatically.

“It’s a question, not a verdict,” she replied. “You hated watching me wait for your father to rearrange his future in our favour. Are you absolutely sure you’re not the one doing the rearranging now?”

I sat with that for a few breaths, watching the tram lines overhead.

“She’s not waiting for me,” I said finally. “She’s walking with me. I told her very early on: if she didn’t want to move, I wasn’t going to drag her. I’d rather be alone than have someone sulking in my slipstream.”

“And she said?” Mum asked.

“She said she wanted me to show her where we were going,” I said. “And then she started buying groceries and learning how to cook steak properly. So I figured we were aligned.”

Mum’s mouth twitched. “Groceries as commitment language,” she said. “Very on brand for you.”

We stopped at another red light. A man in a delivery van pulled up alongside, music thudding faintly. He glanced over, saw two women in a small red car, and lost interest immediately. I felt oddly grateful.

“What about power?” Mum asked, once we were moving again. “You’re older, more experienced, more… you. She’s—”

“Not fragile,” I cut in.

“I didn’t say she was,” Mum said. “I said she’s different. She looks at you like you invented sunlight. That’s a lot of wattage to hold over someone.”

I swallowed. The image wasn’t wrong.

“I know,” I said quietly. “I think about it all the time.”

“Good,” Mum said. “You should.”

“I don’t want to be him,” I added. “I don’t want to be the person whose choices other people orbit until they burn out.”

“You won’t be,” she said, simple as anything. “You’re not lying to her about who you are or where you’re going. That was your father’s sin. Not leaving. Lying.”

The word sat between us, sharp and clean.

“I told Charli from the start,” I said. “I like women. I like work. I like being in charge of my own timetable. I will not shrink myself to make anyone more comfortable. She said that sounded safe to her.”

“And do you love her?” Mum asked.

“Yes,” I said, without hesitation this time. “Completely.”

“Good,” she said. “Because love makes all the other hard work worth doing. Without it, it’s just labour.”

We turned into her new street. Narrow, leafy, the kind of place where people left pot plants on their front steps and pretended they weren’t a trip hazard.

“What about you?” I asked, as I parked. “Now that you’re free of him. Planning to swear off relationships entirely, or will you start interviewing candidates?”

She unbuckled her seatbelt. “I have a salon full of women who tell me everything,” she said. “I have a daughter who stubbornly refused to build her life around a man and has done something much more interesting instead. I have a flat that doesn’t leak. For the moment, that’s quite enough.”

“Translation: you’ll consider someone if she can cut a straight fringe,” I said.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Mum said, opening her door. “I’d never date another hairdresser. Professional rivalry.”

She got out, then leaned back down to look at me through the open door.

“For what it’s worth,” she added, “I’m proud of you. Not for liking girls; that’s just taste. For choosing someone who shows up. And for not pretending it’s easy.”

A little shiver ran through me at that — not fear, not even relief. Just the sense of something old being acknowledged and laid down.

“Thanks,” I said.

“If she hurts you,” Mum went on, brisk again, “I’ll be deeply disappointed, and I’ll make her a very sharp bob she has to grow out slowly. But I don’t think she will.”

“She won’t,” I said. “She’d rather take a bullet than break a promise.”

“Then,” Mum said, straightening, “we’re all right.”

She shut the door, shouldered her bag, and walked towards the building like she owned the street already.

I sat there for a moment in the quiet Swift, fingers resting on the steering wheel, watching her go.

Absent fathers bought cars. Present mothers climbed into them, asked difficult questions, and then left you with a blessing wrapped in practical advice.

I turned the key again and pulled away, heading back towards Wardrobe, towards Charli, feeling… not lighter exactly, but steadier.

We weren’t waiting for anyone to follow us anymore.

We were already on our way.

***Swift scene – revised***

**Celeste POV, 1st person, past tense**

**Drive to Mum’s (Celeste POV, 1st person, past tense)**

---

The next morning the flat smelled like coffee and last night’s rosemary.

Charli was already at Wardrobe; she’d crept out quietly, kissed my shoulder, and whispered something about “bolts arriving stupidly early” before the front door clicked. Mum emerged from the spare room dressed like she was heading straight into a full appointment book: dark trousers, clean shirt, hair pinned so precisely I felt underdressed just looking at her.

“You sleep?” I asked, handing her a mug.

“Enough,” she said. “The bed’s fine. Your towels are still sulking, but we’ve discussed that.”

High praise.

We did the small things—dishwasher, windows, a quick check she hadn’t left anything in the bathroom—and then it was just keys in my hand and her tote back by the door.

“I’ll go home first,” she said as we walked down the stairs. “Quick shower, change, then see what state the salon’s in. Christine swears nobody burned it down while I was gone.”

“If Christine says it’s fine, it’s fine,” I said. “She’d sooner set fire to herself than your cutting chairs.”

“True,” Mum said. “Still, I like to see with my own eyes.”

Outside, the air had that damp coastal brightness Torquay specialised in. The Swift sat at the kerb, sun already warming the faded red paint. Ten years old, a little scratched, utterly reliable. The interior smelled faintly of fabric dust and coffee, with a baseline of salt air from all the runs back and forth to the Faire site.

Mum paused by the bonnet, fingers brushing the badge.

“So he did buy you a decent car,” she said.

“Technically,” I replied, opening my door. “He wired the money and told me to choose something sensible. I ignored ‘sensible’ and chose something small and cute instead. The dealer did the rest.”

“He would have enjoyed feeling generous,” she said, getting in. “At least you got something concrete out of it.”

I turned the key. The engine gave its familiar little cough, then settled. I pulled out onto the road, indicator ticking like a metronome as we headed towards her place—the house I’d grown up in, ten minutes from the flat, two turns from the sea.

For a while we just drove through Torquay waking up: surfers’ utes, school traffic, a line already forming outside the bakery that did the good sourdough.

“How long have you been in love with her?” Mum asked eventually, as if she were asking about the swell.

I checked my mirrors. “We’re starting strong this morning,” I said.

“You said we’d talk,” she replied. “I don’t waste daylight.”

I huffed out a breath. “A couple of weeks,” I said. “Properly. As in: I admitted it to myself and stopped pretending it was just… intense fondness for doing the right thing with the washing.”

“Mm,” she said. “And before that?”

“Before that she was my housemate,” I said. “The team decided that one of our biggest challenges with upscaling Wardrobe was managing waste. Well, Charli was wasting eighty minutes a day commuting. I needed someone to split rent with. The solution seemed obvious.” I paused a moment, then decided to tell her. “Having Charli move in was actually my idea. And as it turned out, not a bad one. I had an extra pair of hands so I could sleep and study and not eat toast for dinner every night.”

“Okay, but you told me a boy was moving in, not a girl. So how did that—”

“I’m getting to that. So, I was mulling things over and realised that the boy was primed to do the *provider* nonsense, and that was going to get really messy—I wasn’t going to have any of that.” I paused again, watching a BMW think it owned the road in front of me.

“And?”

“So, I cut that at the roots. I told Charli that… she—well—*he* was my wife.”

I glanced over at Mum. She was staring at me as if unsure shed heard correctly.

“Wife!”

“Yep.”

“Audacious.”

“Well, it worked. No more *provider* nonsense. And, to be honest, she came to embrace the role. And then…”

“Yes?”

I sighed. “Wardrobe got wind of it. Of 'wife'. And… ran with it. And so, Charli was born. The whole women’s side of Wardrobe somehow decided Charli was actually a girl.”

Mum grimace and shook her head. “That’s not the whole story. I’m going to need that in full at some point.”

“Get in line,” I said. “Lauren still claims royalties.”

We hit the roundabout near the turnoff to the Historical Faire site. I indicated, went straight instead.

“So when Charlie the boy moved into the spare room,” Mum said, calmly dropping the old name between us, “you didn’t think of him as a potential… anything?”

“A potential split of the grocery bill,” I said. “A potential dishwasher. A potential way to not move back in with you and your cockroaches.”

She snorted. “They like you.”

“They’re gross,” I said. “And no. I didn’t think of him like that. He’d been living at home, with Lauren; I knew him as a discarded member of society due to insufficient size and testosterone levels, one who always had ink on his hands and apologised for existing. He was… sweet. Safe. Boy-shaped on paper, but never really… boy.”

“And yet,” she said, “there was a ‘boy’s room’ in your flat, until there wasn’t.”

“Until everyone else caught up to reality before I did,” I said.

She made an interested noise. “Go on.”

I changed lanes, more for something to do than out of necessity.

“Like I said, it started at Wardrobe,” I said. “Lucy had clocked him long ago as being non-blokey. And then, Sarah started in with ‘wives doing all the invisible work’ while we were unloading props. Charli was just… there, doing it all—carrying, organising, checking everyone had water—without being asked. And Lucy, being Lucy, pointed at her and said, ‘That’s because she’s used to it: she’s Celeste’s wife.’”

Mum smiled faintly. “I do like Lucy.”

“So does the universe,” I said. “Anyway, that’s when the word 'she' landed. No one was joking either. You could see it hit something. And Charli just, soaked it up, like someone had just named a chord she’d been hearing all her life but didn’t know how to write down.”

“And you?” Mum asked.

“It hit me that my word had set off a chain reaction that went off under my nose, but I was so busy with Uni and all I missed it,” I said. “The women at Wardrobe, the actresses—they had all started… quietly shifting pronouns ages ago, when I wasn’t in the room. And then, finally, I started hearing it. ‘She’s good with the crowd.’ ‘She’s got such a gentle way with fittings.’ It was like watching everyone tune to the same note while I was still fiddling with my strings.”

“Late to the party,” Mum said.

“Extremely late,” I admitted. “Seemed like everyone was already on their second glass except Lauren and me. Meanwhile I was marching around convinced I was the only one seeing Charli clearly.”

“Bodies don't change without medication.” Mum was calm, but not casual.

I grimaced. “That was the scary bit. Charli had noticed her body changing, that whole late-puberty horror. She was terrified, Mum. Frightened she’d be pushed out of the women’s circle she’d just found. So she did what scared people do in the age of the internet: she tried to fix it herself.”

“So, self-medicating,” Mum said.

“Spironolactone, pills she bought online. No supervision, no bloods, nothing,” I said. “By the time I found the bottle in the bathroom cupboard, she’d been on it long enough that her chest was obvious, her skin softer, everything… tipped. She was afraid of losing it all, Mum. Rejection from Wardrobe, out of the only space that had ever felt like *hers*.”

Mum was quiet for a few heartbeats.

“And you decided to rescue her,” she said.

“I decided to stop her dying of a potassium issue at twenty,” I said. “Her mum and I dragged her to a proper clinic. Made her tell the doctor exactly what she’d been taking, for how long. Got her on something supervised. And then, in the middle of all that, she admitted that ‘girl’ felt more comfortable than anything else she’d tried to call herself.”

“So, was that,” Mum asked, point-blank, “your tipping point?”

“It was and it wasn’t,” I said. “It was the moment she stopped treating ‘girl’ like a costume she might get in trouble for wearing and started treating it like a word that belonged to her. And—” I swallowed. “—somewhere in there I realised I was… invested. More than just not wanting my housemate to accidentally wreck her kidneys.”

Mum watched the houses slide by for a while. The sea flashed blue between them, familiar and indifferent.

“You realise,” she said eventually, “that the women around you seeing her before you did is not a failing. It’s… what women do. We read each other. And you were busy carrying half the world on your back.”

“I know,” I said. “Still feels stupid.”

“Stupid would have been telling her to knock it off and ‘man up,’” Mum said crisply. “You didn’t do that. You listened. You took her to a doctor. You made sure the word she wanted fit her life as well as her reflection.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t realised I was holding.

“I also,” I said, “might be recreating your marriage in reverse, with me as the one with the plan and her trying to keep up.”

“Well, there’s that,” Mum acknowledged. “I was wondering when you’d get to that.”

We stopped at the lights near the turn-off to her street. A kid crossed with a school bag almost as big as she was. The pedestrian light beeped itself hoarse.

“I hate the idea of her orbiting me,” I said. “Of her making herself smaller so my life works. I don’t want a Nigel with better hair. I want a partner.”

“And what does she want?” Mum asked.

“She wants to belong,” I said. “To the work. To Wardrobe. To us. She wants to finish becoming herself without someone yanking the rug. She’s not waiting around for me to give her permission; she’s… busy. She’s the one who keeps our food sorted, our laundry done, half of Wardrobe’s chaos smoothed. The girls listen to her. She’s not trailing. She’s weaving.”

Mum made a thoughtful sound. “And you told her you liked girls.”

“Not really,” I said. “It wasn’t any of her business, then. As a matter of fact, I still wasn’t one-hundred percent convinced myself about that. I guess Charli helped me sort that.”

“And now?” Mum said. “Does she know you’re in love with her?”

I felt my ears heat. “Oh yes, she knows,” I said. “I told her. Clumsily. Mine. It was undignified.”

“Good,” Mum said. “Dignity is overrated.”

We turned into her street. The house looked the same as it always had: single-storey, sun-faded brick, the gum tree out front still dropping leaves like it was being paid by the kilo. Her salon wasn’t far—just up on the main road—but that was tomorrow’s problem.

I parked in the driveway and killed the engine. The sudden quiet pressed in around us.

“What about you?” I asked, as she unbuckled her seatbelt. “Now that you’re back. Swearing off relationships entirely, or will Torquay’s eligible population need to prepare resumes?”

She snorted. “I have a salon full of women who tell me everything,” she said. “I have a business that survived a year without me in the chair. I have my own house that doesn’t leak. For the moment, that’s quite enough.”

“Translation: you’ll consider someone if he or she doesn’t complain about hair splinters in the sheets,” I said.

“Don’t be vulgar,” Mum said, opening her door. “And no, I’m not auditioning anyone. If someone turns up who knows how to hold their own life together, we’ll talk.”

She got out, then leaned back down to look at me through the open door.

“For what it’s worth,” she added, “I’m proud of you. Not for liking girls; that’s just taste. For choosing someone who shows up. For believing her when she told you who she is. And for not pretending any of this is easy.”

A little shiver ran through me at that—not fear, not even relief. Just the sense of something old being acknowledged and laid down.

“Thanks,” I said.

“If she hurts you,” Mum went on, brisk again, “I’ll be deeply disappointed. And I’ll give her a severe bob she has to grow out for two years. But I don’t think she will.”

“She won’t,” I said. “She’d rather take a bullet than break a promise.”

“Then,” Mum said, straightening, “we’re all right.”

She shut the door, shouldered her bag, and walked up the path like she’d only ever stepped out for milk and was now back from a small errand, not a year in another hemisphere.

I sat there for a moment in the quiet Swift, fingers resting on the steering wheel, watching her go.

Absent fathers wired money and called it care. Present mothers got in the car, asked difficult questions, and left you with a blessing wrapped in practical advice.

I turned the key again and pulled away, heading towards Uni—towards the life we were building that didn’t require anyone to follow us from another country.

We weren’t waiting anymore.

We were already on our way.

[26-02-17]

The next morning the flat smelled like coffee and last night’s rosemary.

Charli was already at Wardrobe; she’d crept out quietly, kissed my shoulder, and whispered something about “bolts arriving early” before the front door clicked. Mum emerged from the spare room dressed like she was heading straight to work: dark trousers, clean shirt, hair pinned so precisely I felt underdressed just looking at her.

“You sleep?” I asked, handing her a mug.

“Enough,” she said. “The bed’s fine. Your towels are passable.”

High praise.

We did the small things—dishwasher, windows, a quick check that she hadn’t left anything in the bathroom—and then it was just keys in my hand and her suitcase back by the door.

“I’ve got a short-term lease near the salon,” she said as we got to the car. “One of those furnished boxes they call an apartment.”

“Luxury shoebox,” I said. “Very Melbourne.”

The Swift waited at the kerb, sun already warming the faded red paint. It was ten years old, a little scratched, utterly reliable. The interior smelled faintly of fabric dust and coffee, with a baseline of machine oil from the many times I’d parked it behind Wardrobe.

Mum paused by the bonnet, fingers brushing the badge.

“So he did buy you a decent car,” she said.

“Technically,” I replied, opening my door. “He wired the money and told me to choose something sensible. I ignored ‘sensible’ and chose something small and cute instead. The dealer did the rest.”

“He would have enjoyed feeling generous,” she said, getting in. “You may as well enjoy the result.”

I turned the key. The engine caught with its familiar little cough and then settled, obedient. I pulled out into the street, the indicator ticking like a metronome.

For a while we just drove, letting the city wake up around us. School traffic, tradie utes, a tram dinging half-heartedly at someone who’d blocked the tracks.

“How long have you been in love with her?” Mum asked, eventually, as if she were asking about the weather.

I checked my mirrors. “Going straight or turning left?” I said.

“Answer the question and I’ll tell you,” she replied.

I huffed out a breath and waited for the lights.

“I don’t know,” I said. “It wasn’t a lightning bolt. More like… I looked up one day and realised she’d quietly moved into every room.”

“Hmm,” Mum said. “That happens.”

The light changed. I drove on.

“She moved in as a practicality,” I added. “Remember? Rents were stupid. She needed a place, I had space. It was supposed to be temporary.”

“Temporary,” Mum repeated. “Right. And at what point did ‘temporary housemate’ become ‘woman you share a bed with’?”

I could feel the heat rise in my cheeks, which was annoying. “Probably somewhere between her learning where everything goes in the kitchen and me panicking when she didn’t text that she’d got home from work.”

“So fairly early,” Mum said, unbothered. “And does she know that?”

“I don’t do unrequited,” I said. “It’s inefficient.”

She gave me a small, sideways smile. “No. You don’t.”

We turned onto a bigger road. The traffic picked up; so did her questions.

“When did she start… changing?” Mum asked, choosing her word carefully but without flinching.

“Physically, you mean?” I said.

“That, and otherwise.”

I thought about it. “She was already changing when I met her,” I said. “She just hadn’t drawn the line to the right place yet.”

Mum arched an eyebrow. “Meaning?”

“Meaning,” I said, “that by the time we shared a bathroom, she’d already been on the wrong medications for years, had a body that didn’t behave like the boys around her, and was doing that thing where you pretend you’re just ‘a bit different’ instead of asking if you might actually be something else entirely.”

“And you,” Mum said, “just happened to be on hand with a label.”

“That makes it sound like I slapped a sticker on her forehead,” I said.

“Didn’t you?” There was no accusation in it. Just curiosity.

I tightened my grip on the wheel for a moment, then forced my fingers to relax. “No,” I said. “I asked questions. The same ones you asked me when I told you I wasn’t interested in men. ‘How long have you felt like this?’ ‘Does it feel like relief when you say it out loud?’ ‘Does the word fit or are you forcing it because it’s there?’”

Mum looked out the window, watching a cyclist weave between cars. “And?”

“And every time she tried to say she was a boy, she looked like she was putting on someone else’s coat,” I said. “Too heavy, wrong cut, wouldn’t fasten. When she let herself imagine ‘girl,’ she… softened. Not weaker. Just more… accurate.”

Mum made a thoughtful sound. “Accurate is good.”

I nodded. “I told her I’d rather have an accurate girl than an inaccurate boy taking up space in my bed.”

She snorted softly. “Trust you to make it sound like a paperwork error.”

We drove in silence for a bit. The indicator ticked again as I changed lanes.

“Do you ever worry,” Mum said eventually, “that you’re re-running my marriage in reverse?”

I blinked. “Meaning?”

“Meaning,” she said, “you’re the one with the plan, the car, the degree in progress, the income that doesn’t vanish if someone sneezes at the stock market. She’s the one trailing half a step behind, trying to keep up with your stride.”

“That’s not fair,” I said, automatically.

“It’s a question, not a verdict,” she replied. “You hated watching me wait for your father to rearrange his future in our favour. Are you absolutely sure you’re not the one doing the rearranging now?”

I sat with that for a few breaths, watching the tram lines overhead.

“She’s not waiting for me,” I said finally. “She’s walking with me. I told her very early on: if she didn’t want to move, I wasn’t going to drag her. I’d rather be alone than have someone sulking in my slipstream.”

“And she said?” Mum asked.

“She said she wanted me to show her where we were going,” I said. “And then she started buying groceries and learning how to cook steak properly. So I figured we were aligned.”

Mum’s mouth twitched. “Groceries as commitment language,” she said. “Very on brand for you.”

We stopped at another red light. A man in a delivery van pulled up alongside, music thudding faintly. He glanced over, saw two women in a small red car, and lost interest immediately. I felt oddly grateful.

“What about power?” Mum asked, once we were moving again. “You’re older, more experienced, more… you. She’s—”

“Not fragile,” I cut in.

“I didn’t say she was,” Mum said. “I said she’s different. She looks at you like you invented sunlight. That’s a lot of wattage to hold over someone.”

I swallowed. The image wasn’t wrong.

“I know,” I said quietly. “I think about it all the time.”

“Good,” Mum said. “You should.”

“I don’t want to be him,” I added. “I don’t want to be the person whose choices other people orbit until they burn out.”

“You won’t be,” she said, simple as anything. “You’re not lying to her about who you are or where you’re going. That was your father’s sin. Not leaving. Lying.”

The word sat between us, sharp and clean.

“I told Charli from the start,” I said. “I like women. I like work. I like being in charge of my own timetable. I will not shrink myself to make anyone more comfortable. She said that sounded safe to her.”

“And do you love her?” Mum asked.

“Yes,” I said, without hesitation this time. “Completely.”

“Good,” she said. “Because love makes all the other hard work worth doing. Without it, it’s just labour.”

We turned into her new street. Narrow, leafy, the kind of place where people left pot plants on their front steps and pretended they weren’t a trip hazard.

“What about you?” I asked, as I parked. “Now that you’re free of him. Planning to swear off relationships entirely, or will you start interviewing candidates?”

She unbuckled her seatbelt. “I have a salon full of women who tell me everything,” she said. “I have a daughter who stubbornly refused to build her life around a man and has done something much more interesting instead. I have a flat that doesn’t leak. For the moment, that’s quite enough.”

“Translation: you’ll consider someone if she can cut a straight fringe,” I said.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Mum said, opening her door. “I’d never date another hairdresser. Professional rivalry.”

She got out, then leaned back down to look at me through the open door.

“For what it’s worth,” she added, “I’m proud of you. Not for liking girls; that’s just taste. For choosing someone who shows up. And for not pretending it’s easy.”

A little shiver ran through me at that — not fear, not even relief. Just the sense of something old being acknowledged and laid down.

“Thanks,” I said.

“If she hurts you,” Mum went on, brisk again, “I’ll be deeply disappointed, and I’ll make her a very sharp bob she has to grow out slowly. But I don’t think she will.”

“She won’t,” I said. “She’d rather take a bullet than break a promise.”

“Then,” Mum said, straightening, “we’re all right.”

She shut the door, shouldered her bag, and walked towards the building like she owned the street already.

I sat there for a moment in the quiet Swift, fingers resting on the steering wheel, watching her go.

Absent fathers bought cars. Present mothers climbed into them, asked difficult questions, and then left you with a blessing wrapped in practical advice.

I turned the key again and pulled away, heading back towards Wardrobe, towards Charli, feeling… not lighter exactly, but steadier.

We weren’t waiting for anyone to follow us anymore.

We were already on our way.

🚗 Swift and Strong 🚗

[ Celeste ]

The next morning the flat smelled like coffee and last night’s rosemary.

Charli was already at Wardrobe; she’d crept out, kissed my shoulder, and whispered something about “bolts arriving stupidly early” before the front door clicked. Mum emerged from the spare room dressed like she was heading straight into a full appointment book: dark trousers, clean shirt, hair pinned so precisely I felt underdressed just looking at her.

“You sleep?” I asked, handing her a mug.

“Enough,” she said. “The bed’s fine. Your towels are still sulking, but we’ve discussed that.”

High praise.

We did the small things—dishwasher, windows, a quick check she hadn’t left anything in the bathroom—and then it was just keys in my hand and her tote bag by the door.

“I’ll go home first,” she said as we walked down the stairs. “Quick shower, change, then see what state the salon’s in. Christine swears nobody burned it down while I was gone.”

“If Christine says it’s fine, it’s fine,” I said. “She’d sooner set fire to herself than your cutting chairs.”

“True,” Mum said. “Still, I like to see with my own eyes.”

Outside, the air had that damp coastal brightness Torquay specialised in. The Swift sat at the kerb, sun already warming the faded red paint. Ten years old, a little scratched, utterly reliable. The interior smelled faintly of fabric dust and coffee, with a baseline of salt air from all the runs back and forth to the Faire site.

Mum paused by the bonnet, fingers brushing the badge.

“So he did buy you a decent car,” she said.

“Technically,” I replied, opening my door. “He wired the money and told me to choose something sensible. I ignored ‘sensible’ and chose something small and cute instead. The dealer did the rest.”

“He would have enjoyed feeling generous,” she said, getting in. “At least you got something concrete out of it.”

I turned the key. The engine gave its familiar little cough, then settled. I pulled out onto the road, indicator ticking like a metronome as we headed towards her place—the house I’d grown up in, ten minutes from the flat, two turns from the sea.

For a while we just drove through Torquay waking up: surfers’ utes, school traffic, a line already forming outside the bakery that did the good sourdough.

“How long have you been in love with her?” Mum asked eventually, as if she were asking about the swell.

I checked my mirrors. “We’re starting strong this morning,” I said.

“You said we’d talk,” she replied. “I don’t waste daylight.”

“A couple of weeks,” I said. “Properly. As in: I admitted it to myself and stopped pretending it was just… intense fondness for doing the right thing with the washing.”

“Mm,” she said. “And before that?”

“Before that she was my housemate,” I said. “When we realised upscaling Wardrobe meant managing waste better, one of the big wastes was Charli spending eighty minutes a day commuting. I needed someone to split rent with. The solution seemed obvious.” I hesitated, then decided to give her the whole thing. “Having Charli move in was my idea. And as it turned out, not a bad one. I had an extra pair of hands, so I could sleep and study and not eat toast for dinner every night.”

“Okay, but you told me a boy was moving in, not a girl. So how did that—”

“I’m getting to that.” I watched a BMW in front of me behave like it owned the road. “I was mulling things over and realised the boy was primed to do the *provider* nonsense, and that was going to get really messy—I wasn’t going to have any of that.”

“And?”

“So I cut that at the roots. I told Charli that he was my wife.”

I glanced over at Mum. She was staring at me as if she wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly.

“Wife!”

“Yep.”

“Audacious.”

“Well, it worked. No more *provider* nonsense. And, to be honest, she came to embrace the role. And then…”

“Yes?”

I sighed. “Wardrobe got wind of it. Of ‘wife’. And ran with it. The women at Wardrobe somehow decided Charli was actually a girl.”

Mum grimaced and shook her head. “That’s not the whole story. I’m going to need that in full at some point.”

“Get in line,” I said. “Lauren still claims royalties.”

We hit the roundabout near the turnoff to the Historical Faire site. I indicated, went straight instead.

“So when Charlie the boy moved into the spare room,” Mum said, calmly dropping the old name between us, “you didn’t think of him as a potential… anything?”

“So does the universe,” I said. “Anyway, that’s when the word ‘she’ landed. No one was joking. You could see it hit something. And Charli just soaked it up, like someone had finally named a chord she’d been hearing all her life but didn’t know how to write down.”

She snorted. “I have a salon full of women who tell me everything,” she said. “I have a business that survived a year without me in the chair. I have my own house that doesn’t leak. For the moment, that’s quite enough.”

“Translation: you’ll consider someone if he or she doesn’t complain about hair splinters in the sheets,” I said.

“Don’t be vulgar,” Mum said, opening her door. “And no, I’m not auditioning anyone. If someone turns up who knows how to hold their own life together, we’ll talk.”

She got out, then leaned back down to look at me through the open door.

“For what it’s worth,” she added, “I’m proud of you. Not for liking girls; that’s just taste. For choosing someone who shows up. For believing her when she told you who she is. And for not pretending any of this is easy.”

A little shiver ran through me at that—not fear, not even relief. Just the sense of something old being acknowledged and laid down.

“Thanks,” I said.

“If she hurts you,” Mum went on, brisk again, “I’ll be deeply disappointed. And I’ll give her a severe bob she has to grow out for two years. But I don’t think she will.”

“She won’t,” I said. “She’d rather take a bullet than break a promise.”

“Then,” Mum said, straightening, “we’re all right.”

She shut the door, shouldered her bag, and walked up the path like she’d only ever stepped out for milk and was now back from a small errand, not a year in another hemisphere.

I sat there for a moment in the quiet Swift, fingers resting on the steering wheel, watching her go.

Absent fathers wired money and called it care. Present mothers got in the car, asked difficult questions, and left you with a blessing wrapped in practical advice.

I turned the key again and pulled away, heading towards Uni—towards the life we were building that didn’t require anyone to follow us from another country.

We weren’t waiting anymore.

🚗 Swift and Strong 🚗
[ Celeste ]

The next morning the flat smelled like coffee and last night’s rosemary.

Charli was already at Wardrobe; she’d crept out, kissed my shoulder, and whispered something about “bolts arriving stupidly early” before the front door clicked. Mum emerged from the spare room dressed like she was heading straight into a full appointment book: dark trousers, clean shirt, hair pinned so precisely I felt underdressed just looking at her.

“You sleep?” I asked, handing her a mug.

“Enough,” she said. “The bed’s fine. Your towels are still sulking, but we’ve discussed that.”

High praise.

We did the small things—dishwasher, windows, a quick check she hadn’t left anything in the bathroom—and then it was just keys in my hand, my Uni stuff under my arm and her tote bag by the door.

“I’ll just go home first,” she said as we walked down the stairs. “Quick shower and change. Can’t wait to see what state the salon’s in. Christine swears nobody burned it down while I was gone.”

“If Christine says it’s fine, it’s fine,” I said. “She’d sooner set fire to herself than your cutting chairs.”

“True,” Mum said. “Still, I like to see with my own eyes.”

Outside, the air had that damp coastal brightness Torquay specialised in. The Swift sat at the kerb, sun already warming the faded red paint. Ten years old, a little scratched, utterly reliable. The interior smelled faintly of fabric dust and coffee, with a baseline of salt air from all the runs back and forth to the Faire site.

Mum paused by the bonnet, fingers brushing the badge.

“So he did buy you a decent car,” she said.

“Technically,” I replied, opening my door. “He wired the money and told me to choose something sensible. I ignored ‘sensible’ and chose something small and cute instead. The dealer did the rest.”

“He would have enjoyed feeling generous,” she said, getting in. “At least you got something concrete out of it.”

I turned the key. The engine gave its familiar little cough, then settled. I pulled out onto the road, indicator ticking like a metronome as we headed towards her place—the house I’d grown up in, ten minutes from the flat, two turns from the sea.

For a while we just drove through Torquay waking up: surfers’ utes, school traffic, a line already forming outside the bakery that did the good sourdough.

“How long have you been in love with her?” Mum asked eventually, as if she were asking about the swell.

I checked my mirrors. “We’re starting strong this morning,” I said.

“You said we’d talk,” she replied. “I don’t waste daylight.”

“A couple of weeks,” I said. “Properly. As in: I admitted it to myself and stopped pretending it was just… intense fondness for doing the right thing with the washing.”

“Mm,” she said. “And before that?”

“Before that she was my housemate,” I said. “When we realised upscaling Wardrobe meant managing waste better, one of the big wastes was Charli spending eighty minutes a day commuting. I needed someone to split rent with. The solution seemed obvious.” I hesitated, then decided to give her the whole thing. “Having Charli move in was my idea. And as it turned out, not a bad one. I had an extra pair of hands, so I could sleep and study and not eat toast for dinner every night.”

“Okay, but you told me a boy was moving in, not a girl. So how did that—”

“I’m getting to that.” I watched a BMW in front of me behave like it owned the road. “I was mulling things over and realised the boy was primed to do the provider nonsense, and that was going to get really messy—I wasn’t going to have any of that.”

“And?”

“So I cut that at the roots. I told Charli that he was my wife.”

I glanced over at Mum. She was staring at me as if she wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly.

“Wife!”

“Yep.”

“Audacious.”

“Well, it worked. No more provider nonsense. And, to be honest, she came to embrace the role. And then…”

“Yes?”

I sighed. “Wardrobe got wind of it. Of ‘wife’. And ran with it. The women at Wardrobe somehow decided Charli was actually a girl.”

Mum grimaced and shook her head. “That’s not the whole story. I’m going to need that in full at some point.”

“Get in line,” I said. “Lauren still claims royalties.”

We hit the roundabout near the turnoff to the Historical Faire site. I indicated, went straight instead.

“So when Charlie the boy moved into the spare room,” Mum said, calmly dropping the old name between us, “you didn’t think of him as a potential… anything?”

“A potential split of the grocery bill,” I said. “A potential dishwasher. A potential way to not move back in with you and your cockroaches.”

She snorted. “They like you.”

“They’re gross,” I said. “And no. I didn’t think of him like that. He’d been living at home with Lauren; I knew him as a discarded member of society due to insufficient size and testosterone levels, one who always had ink on his hands and apologised for existing. He was… sweet. Safe. Boy-shaped on paper, but never really… boy.”

“And yet,” she said, “there was a ‘boy’s room’ in your flat, until there wasn’t.”

“Until everyone else caught up to reality,” I said.

She made an interested noise. “Go on.”

I changed lanes, more for something to do than out of necessity.

“Like I said, it started at Wardrobe,” I said. “Lucy had clocked him long ago as being non-blokey. Then Sarah started in with ‘wives doing all the invisible work’ while we were unloading props. Charli was just… there, doing it all—carrying, organising, checking everyone had water—without being asked. And Lucy, being Lucy, pointed at her and said, ‘That’s because she’s used to it: she’s Celeste’s wife.’”

Mum smiled faintly. “I do like Lucy.”

“So does the universe,” I said. “Anyway, that’s when the word ‘she’ landed. No one was joking. You could see it hit something. And Charli just soaked it up, like someone had finally named a chord she’d been hearing all her life but didn’t know how to write down.”

“And you?” Mum asked.

“It hit me that my word had set off a chain reaction under my nose while I was buried in Uni and everything else,” I said. “The women at Wardrobe, the actresses—they’d already started quietly shifting pronouns ages ago, when I wasn’t in the room. And then, finally, I started hearing it. ‘She’s good with the crowd.’ ‘She’s got such a gentle way with fittings.’ It was like watching everyone tune to the same note while I was still fiddling with my strings.”

“Late to the party,” Mum said.

“Extremely late,” I admitted. “It felt like everyone was already on their second glass except Lauren and me. Meanwhile I was marching around convinced I was the only one seeing Charli clearly.”

“Bodies don’t change without medication.” Mum was calm, but not casual.

I grimaced. “That was the scary bit. Charli had noticed her body changing—that whole late-puberty horror. She was terrified she’d be pushed out of the women’s circle she’d just found. So she did what scared people do in the age of the internet: she tried to fix it herself.”

“So, self-medicating,” Mum said.

“Spironolactone, pills she bought online,” I said. “No supervision, no bloods, nothing. By the time I found the bottle in the bathroom cupboard, she’d been on it long enough that her chest was obvious, her skin softer, everything… tipped.” A bus in front of us belched black smoke into the pristine morning air. I flipped the switch to raise my window. “She was afraid of losing it all, Mum. Rejection from Wardrobe, out of the only space that had ever felt like hers.”

Mum said nothing for a moment.

“And so, you decided to rescue her,” she said quietly.

“I decided to keep her heart from going off-script at twenty,” I said. “Her mum and I dragged her to a proper clinic. Made her tell the doctor exactly what she’d been taking, for how long. Got her on something supervised. And then, in the middle of all that, she admitted to me that ‘girl’ felt more comfortable than anything else she’d tried to call herself.”

“So, was that,” Mum asked, point-blank, “your tipping point?”

“It was and it wasn’t,” I said. “It was the moment she stopped treating ‘girl’ like a costume she might get in trouble for wearing and started treating it like a word that belonged to her. And—” I swallowed. “—somewhere in there I realised I was… invested. More than just not wanting my housemate to accidentally wreck her kidneys.”

Mum watched the houses slide by for a while. The sea flashed blue between them, familiar and indifferent.

“You realise,” she said eventually, “that the women around you seeing her before you did is not a failing. It’s… what women do. We read each other. besides, you were busy carrying half the world on your back.”

“I know,” I said. “Still feels stupid.”

“Stupid would have been telling her to knock it off and ‘man up,’” Mum said crisply. “You didn’t do that. You listened. You took her to a doctor. You made sure the word she wanted fit her life as well as her reflection.”

I let out a breath I hadn’t realised I was holding.

“I also,” I said, “might be recreating your marriage in reverse, with me as the one with the plan and her trying to keep up.”

“Well, there’s that,” Mum acknowledged. “I was wondering when you’d get to that.”

We stopped at the lights near the turnoff to her street. A kid crossed with a school bag almost as big as she was. The pedestrian light beeped itself hoarse.

“I hate the idea of her orbiting me,” I said. “Of her making herself smaller so my life works. I don’t want a Nigel with better hair. I want a partner.”

“And what does she want?” Mum asked.

“She wants to belong,” I said. “To the work. To Wardrobe. To us. She wants to finish becoming herself without someone yanking the rug. She’s not waiting around for me to give her permission; she’s… busy. She’s the one who keeps our food sorted, our laundry done, half of Wardrobe’s chaos smoothed. The girls listen to her. She’s not trailing. She’s weaving.”

Mum made a thoughtful sound. “And you told her you liked girls.”

“Not really,” I said. “It wasn’t any of her business, then. I still wasn’t entirely convinced myself about that. I guess Charli helped me sort that.”

“And now?” Mum said. “Does she know you’re in love with her?”

I felt my ears heat. “Oh yes, she knows,” I said. “I told her. Clumsily. It was undignified.”

“Good,” Mum said. “Dignity is overrated.”

We turned into her street. The house looked the same as it always had: single-storey, sun-faded brick, the gum tree out front still dropping leaves like it was being paid by the kilo. Her salon wasn’t far—just up on the main road—but that was tomorrow’s problem.

I parked in the driveway and killed the engine. The sudden quiet pressed in around us.

“What about you?” I asked, as she unbuckled her seatbelt. “Now that you’re back. Swearing off relationships entirely, or will Torquay’s eligible population need to prepare résumés?”
