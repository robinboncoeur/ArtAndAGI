[26-01-23]

**Scene 48 — “Unsafe” (Celeste POV)**

The next day at Wardrobe, I walked in wearing my usual face.

Calm. Clear. Adult.

But my body had changed overnight in a way I couldn’t hide from myself: it remembered Charli’s touch.

It wanted it.

Even in the bright clatter of morning, even with steam in the air and Mara’s shears already snicking like punctuation, my skin carried the echo of her fingers the way fabric carries perfume.

Charli arrived ten minutes after me.

She came in quieter than usual, as if she was trying to be respectful of something she didn’t fully understand yet: that intimacy changes gravity.

Her eyes met mine for half a beat, and her mouth softened.

Not a grin.

Not a performance.

Just… a private warmth.

I kept my expression neutral and turned back to the ledger.

We had actresses coming in mid-morning. A fitting schedule. A collar repair. A cap batch that needed tying.

Everything normal.

Which meant everything fragile.

Because Wardrobe isn’t just a workplace. It’s a structure. A shelter. It’s women’s safety engineered into habits.

And safety is not compatible with visible romance.

Not here.

Not yet.

Charli moved to the cap table, began sorting ties, checking angles with her new competence. Mara barked a correction; Charli absorbed it without flinching. Lauren strode through with her clipboard. Sarah looked like she’d slept badly but held her posture like a weapon.

I was grateful for the noise. It kept me composed.

Then—because life loves irony—an actress arrived early, cheerful and loud, bringing the energy of an audience.

“Morning! Oh my god, this place is like a *beehive!*”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “Stand still. Talk later.”

The actress laughed, compliant.

Charli turned to fetch something from the shelf behind her, and she brushed past me in the narrow aisle between tables.

I felt her pause.

I didn’t look up.

Then her fingers—light as breath—touched the back of my hand.

A tiny, secret stroke. A *private* affection.

It lasted less than a second.

It was enough.

Because my body reacted before my mind could stop it: a small shiver under my skin, a tightening in my throat, a pulse spike that made me suddenly aware of my own mouth.

It was a human response.

Which is exactly why it was dangerous.

Charli’s eyes flicked up to my face, bright with that same hopeful devotion from last night, and she smiled—small, pleased—because she’d felt my reaction and interpreted it as permission.

I held very still.

Across the room, Sarah’s gaze snapped toward us.

Not jealous.

Not judging.

Alert.

She had the instincts of a woman who knows what men—and gossip—do with information.

And two tables away, the actress’s eyes slid over us with curiosity.

The wrong kind.

A glance too long. A faint tilt of the mouth. Interest.

Data being collected.

I felt my stomach go cold.

Charli didn’t see any of that. She was still living in the softness of last night, still floating in the relief of being wanted.

She reached—without thinking—and tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

A gesture so gentle, so domestic, so *girlfriend*, it might as well have been an announcement.

The room didn’t stop.

But the temperature changed.

Sarah’s posture sharpened.

Lauren’s head lifted.

Mara’s eyes flicked up, brief and hard.

And the actress smiled like she’d just found a delicious new subplot.

I turned my head slowly and looked at Charli.

Not angry.

Not cruel.

But my expression was enough.

Charli’s face drained of colour.

Her hand fell away as if it had been burned.

I leaned closer—not to soften it, but to keep it private.

“Not here,” I said, low.

Charli’s eyes widened in horror.

“I—” she began.

“Not here,” I repeated, firmer. “Never at work. Do you understand me?”

Charli swallowed hard.

“Yes,” she whispered.

Her voice trembled. Her eyes shone.

She looked like someone who had just realised she’d walked into traffic.

I straightened and turned back to the ledger.

The actress chirped, oblivious or pretending to be. “Sorry—am I early?”

Lauren answered smoothly, saving the moment like she saved everything.

“You’re early,” Lauren said pleasantly. “But we’ll take you. Fitting room, please.”

The actress followed Lauren, still smiling.

Still storing.

Charli stood frozen at the cap table, hands hovering, afraid to touch anything.

I didn’t look at her again.

Not because I didn’t want to.

Because if I did, I might soften.

And softness at the wrong time is how women get hurt.
