**Scene 49 — “Consequences” (Celeste POV)**

I waited until lunch.

Not because I wanted to punish her with time.

Because if I spoke too soon, my voice would carry the wrong emotion.

I needed to be the adult.

And—this was the new part—I needed to be the adult while my body still wanted her hands on my skin.

That was the discipline now.

After lunch, I sent Charli a single message.

**Back room. Five minutes.**

No emoji. No softness. Structure.

Charli arrived exactly on time, of course.

She stood just inside the door like a schoolgirl, shoulders tight, hands clasped in front of her as if her fingers couldn’t be trusted.

Her eyes were red-rimmed. She’d tried not to cry. She’d failed. Quietly.

I didn’t comment on it.

I leaned against the table and kept my face calm.

“What happened this morning,” I said, “was unsafe.”

Charli flinched.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“No,” I said, and held up a hand. “Not that word. You don’t apologise to make yourself feel smaller. You listen.”

Charli’s mouth closed. She nodded once, hard.

I continued, steady.

“Wardrobe is a women’s workplace. It is a safe space by design. That design depends on two things: privacy and clarity.”

Charli stared at the floor, breathing shallowly.

“You touched me in a way that signalled intimacy,” I said. “In front of staff. In front of a client.”

Charli’s throat moved. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to signal—”

“I know,” I said, and my voice softened *one notch* because it was true. “But intent is not the point.”

Her head lifted slightly, eyes wet.

“The point,” I continued, “is consequences. In a room like ours, intimacy becomes currency for other people. Gossip. Leverage. Narratives. And women pay for that.”

Charli’s face crumpled, not theatrically—just honest pain.

“I didn’t think,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said again. “That’s why we’re talking.”

I pushed off the table and stepped closer—not to comfort her, but to anchor her with fact.

“This is not me rejecting you,” I said, very clearly. “This is me protecting you. And protecting Wardrobe.”

Charli’s eyes snapped up.

“You’re… not…?” Her voice broke.

I held her gaze.

“No,” I said. “I’m not.”

She exhaled shakily, as if she’d been holding her breath since morning.

Then the devotion returned—too fast, too eager—and she stepped forward like she wanted to touch me to confirm it.

I stopped her with a small gesture.

Charli froze.

I let the silence do its work.

“This is part of being a woman in a women’s space,” I said. “You don’t get to let your feelings spill wherever they want. You learn where it’s safe.”

Charli nodded rapidly, tears slipping now.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can. I will.”

“Good,” I said.

Then I delivered the consequence, clean and boring, like policy.

“For the next two weeks,” I said, “you and I behave at work as we always have. Professional. No private signals. No touches. No looks that linger. We don’t feed anyone a story.”

Charli’s face tightened in fear.

Two weeks must have sounded like exile.

I watched her carefully.

“This is not punishment,” I added, because I meant it. “It’s training. It’s protection. It’s a reset.”

Charli swallowed.

“Yes,” she whispered, and I could see her trying to be brave.

“And,” I continued, “if you feel the urge to touch me at work, you redirect it into craft.”

Charli blinked.

I nodded toward the shelves.

“Pins,” I said. “Ties. Tension. You put your devotion into the work. That is how women survive in public.”

Charli’s breath shuddered.

“Yes,” she said again, steadier this time. “I understand.”

I held her gaze for a long beat, then—because I am not cruel—I gave her one truthful softness.

“Last night,” I said quietly, “was real.”

Charli’s eyes filled again, but this time the tears looked like relief.

“And it will continue,” I added. “At home. After hours. Where it is safe.”

Charli nodded, trembling.

“Yes,” she breathed. “I’ll be good.”

I sighed—small, controlled.

“Don’t say ‘good’ like that,” I said. “Say ‘careful.’”

Charli swallowed, corrected herself.

“I’ll be careful.”

“Better,” I said.

I stepped back and opened the door.

“Now,” I said, returning to the adult voice, “wash your face. Fix your posture. Go back out there. You’re not in trouble. You’re learning.”

Charli wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand, nodded, and turned to go.

At the doorway she paused—hesitated—then looked back at me with a question in her eyes.

Not asking for touch.

Asking for certainty.

I gave her a small nod.

The kind that says: *We are still us. Just not here.*

Charli exhaled and went back into Wardrobe.

I closed the door and stood alone in the back room for a moment longer than necessary, letting the ache in my chest settle into something I could carry.

Because this was the new truth:

I wanted her.

I wanted her touch.

And I would still choose the standards that kept her safe.

Even when it hurt.

Especially when it hurt.

---

If you like, the next scene can be the *evening after this consequence talk* — where Charli, determined to “be careful,” becomes **almost comically** cautious… and Celeste has to guide her back into softness: *“Careful doesn’t mean distant.”* That’s a gorgeous way to show Celeste’s floodgates staying open **in the correct place**. 💛

---

[ Celeste ]

By the time I got home, my brain felt like it had been put through a blender labelled *critical theory*.

The flat was warm, lights on low. I could hear the fan in the bathroom and the faint clink of plates in the kitchen. Charli’s music was on — not loud, just a piano thing from some obscure YouTube channel she’d found. Normally, that sound meant safe: home, food, her.

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my shoes.

“Hey, woman,” I called. “Tell me you made something that didn’t come from a packet.”

“I did,” she said, appearing in the kitchen doorway with a tea towel over one shoulder. “Sort of.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach anything behind her eyes.

The table was set. Chicken tray-bake, salad, the good olive oil. Exactly the kind of sensible, comforting dinner she’d default to when she knew I’d be late. I kissed her cheek as I passed, automatically. Her skin flinched under my mouth in a way most people wouldn’t have noticed.

I noticed.

“You okay?” I asked, pulling out my chair.

“Yeah,” she said too quickly. “Just tired. Long day.”

I sat. So did she. We ate.

It wasn’t that she was silent. That would have been easier to read. She asked about lectures, and I gave her the condensed version — debates, one professor who still thought “woman” was a theoretical category, the usual. She laughed in the right places, nodded in the right places.

But her fork kept missing her mouth by a fraction, like she wasn’t entirely in the room.

“Nothing interesting happen at Wardrobe?” I asked at one point, topping up her water.

She froze for half a second. It was so small you could have filed it under cutlery adjustment and moved on. Then she shrugged.

“New fabric delivery,” she said. “Sarah liked the wool for the Les Mis coats. Mara yelled at a spreadsheet. The usual.”

She left something out. I could feel the gap like a draught.

“Okay,” I said, letting it slide — for the moment. “We’ll talk coat cuts later. I have Opinions.”

After dinner she insisted on doing the dishes, which was not suspicious in itself — she liked the small, contained task of it — but she refused my offer to help with a quick, brittle, “I’ve got it, it’s fine.”

Fine. The most useless word in the language.

I showered, changed into an old T-shirt and shorts, and curled up on the couch with my laptop, pretending to look at an article while watching her move around the kitchen. Her shoulders were up. Her movements were too careful.

When she finally came to the couch, she didn’t tuck herself in under my arm the way she normally did. Instead, she perched at the far end, legs tucked under her, arms folded tightly across her chest as if she were cold.

We watched something forgettable on Netflix for twenty minutes. Or rather, Netflix talked at us while both of us stared somewhere a few inches in front of our faces.

This was ridiculous.

I shut the laptop and muted the TV.

“Okay,” I said. “Talk to me. What’s going on?”

She startled, eyes flicking to me and away again. “Nothing. I’m just—”

“Don’t say tired,” I cut in. “You’re behaving like I did something wrong or you did something wrong, and neither of those things magically appear out of ‘long day.’”

Her throat worked. “I don’t want to… make it a big deal,” she said.

“Too late,” I said, more sharply than I meant to. “We’re already in the ‘weird distance on the couch’ zone. That counts as a big deal in a flat with one bedroom.”

She flinched, just a little. My stomach tightened. This was not going the way I wanted it to.

“Did I do something?” I asked, forcing my voice softer. “Say something? Forget something?”

“No,” she said quickly. “You’ve been at lectures. You haven’t done anything.”

“Then what?” I pushed. “You’re coiled like a spring. You pulled away when I kissed you. You keep looking at me like you’re waiting for me to… I don’t know. Burst into flames. I can’t fix what I don’t know about, Charli.”

Her fingers dug into the fabric of her leggings. She stared at the blank TV screen.

“I just need a bit of space,” she whispered.

Something old and hard in me flared at that. The ghost of nights listening to my mother try to pry information out of a man who insisted everything was fine right up until he announced his next unilateral decision.

Space. Silence. Delay.

I took a slow breath, trying not to let that ghost drive.

“Space from *what*?” I asked. “Me? Us? The world? Dinner? Because I’m not psychic. If you’ve had a bad day, I want to know. That’s literally part of the job description.”

“I know,” she said. Her eyes were shiny now. “I just… don’t want to be… weak.”

Ah.

“Being honest about something crap that happened isn’t weak,” I said. “Withholding information so I can walk straight into it with both feet is not strength, it’s sabotage.”

The words came out harsher than they sounded in my head.

She recoiled like I’d slapped her.

“I’m not trying to sabotage anything,” she said, voice cracking. “I’m just— I’m trying to… handle it.”

“Handle *what*, Charli?” My own patience snapped. “There is a line between resilience and shutting down. You can’t keep me out and then punish me for not magically knowing what’s wrong.”

Her face crumpled. She shrank back into the corner of the couch, arms coming up around herself like armour.

“I’m not— I’m not punishing you,” she stammered. “I just… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”

“Then when?” I demanded. “Tomorrow? Next week? After it’s festered so long you can’t tell if you’re angry at me or at yourself or at someone else entirely? That’s not how we do this, Charli. We don’t train resilience by—”

I stopped.

That wasn’t my line.

That was Mara’s, thrown at Sarah in the early days when Wardrobe had nearly eaten her alive.

*We don’t train resilience by ambush.*

And here I was, ambushing.

Charli was fully curled now, knees to chest, breathing shallow. Any thought I’d had about maybe closing the gap between us, touching her, smoothing it over with physical closeness — idiotic. Her whole body was broadcasting NO.

The damage was done, at least for the evening.

“Fine,” I said, standing up because sitting there watching her flinch was suddenly unbearable. “Have your space. I’m going to do some reading.”

I grabbed my laptop and retreated to the bedroom like a coward.

---

An hour later, the article on my screen still hadn’t got past the second paragraph. Every time I got to the word “subjectivity,” my brain swapped in *Charli*, and everything else dissolved.

I could hear the TV through the wall again, low. The occasional fizz of a text notification. Her, breathing.

My phone buzzed on the bedside table.

**SARAH**:

> Just flagging something before it eats you both.
> Your girl had a run-in with the QLD rep this arvo.
> Hand on her back, too close, all that fun.
> I intervened, he apologised (grudgingly). She shook it off *out loud* but not in her eyes.
> She wouldn’t let me call you; said you were busy.
> Maybe go gentle.
> Mara says: “we don’t train resilience by ambush.” xx

For a second, everything in me went very, very still.

The image appeared in my mind already complete: the loading bay, Charli in that pale blue caraco, someone’s hand where it had absolutely no right to be. Her brittle little smile at dinner. The way she’d flinched when I kissed her cheek.

And then, right on top of it, my own voice, cool and righteous: *You can’t keep me out and then punish me…*

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Celeste, you idiot.”

I texted back.

**ME**:

> Thank you.
> I was an idiot.
> Will fix if not too late.
> (Tell Mara she’s right. Again. Obviously.)

Sarah’s reply was almost instant.

**SARAH**:

> She’s always right, it’s very annoying.
> You’re not an idiot, you’re just ahead of the curve.
> Trauma brains take longer. Don’t sprint them.

I put the phone down and scrubbed both hands over my face.

Nigel’s ghost was laughing somewhere — that part of me that had learned silence as danger and now treated any lack of immediate disclosure as betrayal. I had promised myself I would never be the person someone else had to tiptoe around with a wound.

And there I was, all heavy boots and impatience.

I went back to the lounge.

The TV was still playing something; Charli wasn’t watching it. She was sitting exactly where I’d left her, knees hugged to her chest, eyes fixed on a blank patch of wall. She looked smaller than I’d seen her in a long time.

I turned the TV off with the remote. The sudden quiet made both of us flinch.

“Charli,” I said softly. “Can I sit?”

She nodded, eyes flicking to me and away again.

I sat at the other end of the couch, leaving a deliberate stretch of space between us. No reaching, no touching. Just there.

“I got a text from Sarah,” I said. “About what happened with the Queensland rep.”

Her whole body jolted. Her hands flew up to her face.

“She didn’t— I told her not to bother you,” she gasped. “It was— it wasn’t— I mean, she dealt with it, it’s fine, I should have—”

“Stop,” I said, gently but firmly. “You didn’t do anything wrong. She did exactly what she should have done, which was make sure I wasn’t blundering around in the dark like an idiot. Which I was.”

“You’re not an idiot,” she whispered, from behind her hands.

“I am when I expect you to behave like someone who hasn’t just had her boundaries steamrolled in a loading bay,” I said. “I came home and saw you shutting down and instead of thinking, *maybe something happened*, my brain went straight to *why won’t she tell me, I deserve full access.* That is… not my proudest moment.”

Her fingers parted a little. I could see her eyes through the gap, wet and wary.

“I didn’t want to be… dramatic,” she said. “It was just a hand. Sarah sorted it. I thought if I made a fuss you’d think I was—”

“Weak?” I supplied.

She nodded, miserably.

I took a breath.

“I do want you to tell me when something like that happens,” I said, carefully. “Not because I want to control your processing, but because I can’t stand the idea of you going through it alone ten metres away from me while I complain about lecture slides.”

She winced. “I know. I just… felt stupid. I smiled. I didn’t say ‘don’t touch me.’ I froze. What if he thought— I mean, maybe it was my fault for being outside in costume and—”

“No,” I said, the word coming out sharper than I meant. “Absolutely not. Stop right there.”

She flinched, but she stopped.

“You did nothing wrong,” I said again, forcing my voice level. “You were at work, in your workplace, doing your job, in clothes we put you in. He chose to treat you like scenery. That’s on him. Not on your smile, not on your costume, not on your courtesy.”

“But I should have—”

“You should have been able to take a fabric delivery without someone turning you into a prop,” I snapped. Then caught myself. “Sorry. I’m not angry at you. I’m angry on your behalf and I’m bad at modulating that.”

She let out a shaky laugh that wasn’t really a laugh.

“I just keep thinking,” she said, voice small, “Sarah handled it so well. Calm. Firm. Like she wasn’t… scared. I should be like that by now. You’d have told him off in three languages. I just stood there and let my brain turn into soup.”

And there it was. The heart of it.

She felt like she’d failed some invisible womanhood exam.

Something in my chest twisted hard enough to hurt.

“Oh, Charli,” I said. “No. This is not a ‘should by now’ situation. You’re not… defective because your nervous system did what nervous systems do under threat.”

“I’m tired of being… the one who shakes afterwards,” she said. “I want to be someone who doesn’t freeze. Someone like you. Or Mara. Or Sarah. You all seem so—”

“Trained?” I offered. “Practised?”

She nodded.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “We are. Because we had to be. Because we’ve had years of this. Decades. You haven’t. You didn’t grow up being taught to scan every room for exits and hands. You were busy trying to survive being misread in other ways.”

She blinked at that.

“And instead of remembering that,” I went on, “I walked in tonight and basically told you off for not bouncing back on my schedule. I used my own baggage — the Nigel-shaped stuff — as an excuse to demand answers you weren’t ready to give. That’s on me.”

The words felt like gravel in my mouth. But they were true.

Her eyes filled again. “I don’t want you to feel bad,” she said. “You just… wanted to understand.”

“I *do* feel bad,” I said. “Because I scared you more when you were already scared. Because I made this about my need to know instead of your need to feel safe. Because I became the person I promised myself I wouldn’t be — the one someone else has to tiptoe around when they’re hurt.”

My throat burned. To my own surprise, my eyes stung.

I looked away, pressed the heel of my hand to my face, and realised, with a small shock, that I was crying.

It wasn’t pretty. It wasn’t cinematic. It was just… tears, sudden and hot, spilling over before I’d decided whether I was allowed them.

“I’m sorry,” I managed. “I am so, so sorry, Charli. You did nothing wrong. I should have led with ‘are you okay’ and shut up long enough to actually listen. Instead I came in with a checklist and a deadline. Can you forgive me?”

There was a long pause.

Then I felt the cushion dip. She moved, slowly, inching along the couch until her knee bumped my thigh.

“Hey,” she said softly. “Don’t cry. You’re allowed to get it wrong sometimes. You’re not… him.”

The pronoun landed with a thud between us.

“I know,” I said. “But sometimes I can feel… the echo. The part of me that wants clean answers on my timetable because I’ve seen what happens when women wait too long for men to speak. And if I’m not careful, I point that impatience at the wrong person.”

“Me,” she said.

“Yeah,” I said, voice cracking. “You. The one person I should be making it easier for.”

She hesitated, then reached out and took my hand. Her fingers were still a bit cold, but there was intent in the movement. Her choice.

“I should have told you,” she said quietly. “Not because I owe you a performance, but because… I don’t want to carry that sort of thing by myself anymore. I just… didn’t have the words yet. My brain was still stuck on ‘it wasn’t that bad’ and ‘I’m overreacting.’”

“And I should have given you the time to find them,” I said. “Instead of trying to drill them out of you like a dentist from hell.”

She huffed a wet little laugh. “That’s a terrible image.”

“I contain multitudes,” I said.

We sat there for a moment, side by side, fingers laced, matching breaths.

“Can we…” she started, then faltered. “Can we just… not… be physical tonight? I mean, not in a… sex way. I don’t want you to feel rejected. I just… my skin feels… wrong.”

“Of course,” I said immediately. “We can do as much or as little as you want. We can sleep back-to-back, we can sleep holding hands, we can put a pillow fort between us like we’re twelve at a sleepover. Whatever feels safest.”

She nodded, shoulders lowering a fraction.

“Could we…” she said, cheeks pinking, “maybe just… cuddle? Clothes on. Lights off. No… expectations. I don’t want to push you away, I just… need you to be… very obviously on my side.”

“I am always on your side,” I said. “Even when I’m being a clumsy idiot, I am on your side.”

“Okay,” she whispered. “Then… cuddle would be nice.”

I squeezed her hand. “Done.”

As we stood up to go to bed, she paused.

“Celeste?”

“Mm?”

“Next time something like that happens,” she said, “I’ll… try to tell you sooner. Even if it’s messy. Even if I don’t have all the words. I don’t want to… freeze you out.”

I nodded. “And next time I see you doing the goldfish stare on the couch, I will start with, ‘I love you, something looks off, do you want to tell me about it now, later, or never?’ in that order. No drills. No ultimatums.”

She smiled, a real one this time. “Deal.”

In bed, we lay on our sides facing each other, foreheads almost touching, breathing the same small pocket of air. No rush, no agenda. Just two women in a too-small bed, trying to unlearn old reflexes and build new ones.

At some point in the dark, with her fingers curled in the fabric of my T-shirt like an anchor, a thought came and settled in my chest:

*Resilience isn’t the speed at which you stop hurting. It’s the certainty that next time, you won’t be alone.*

We were, slowly and clumsily, getting there. Together.

By the time I got home, my brain felt like it had been put through a blender labelled *organisation behaviour*.

The flat was warm, lights on gentle. I could hear the fan in the bathroom and the faint clink of plates in the kitchen. Charli’s music was on—not loud, just some string serenade from an obscure YouTube channel she’d found. Normally, that sound meant safe: home, food, her.

After dinner she insisted on doing the dishes, which was not suspicious in itself—she liked the small, contained task of it—but she refused my offer to help with a quick, brittle, “I’ve got it, it’s fine.”

Fine. Seasoned with an off tone, it didn’t mean it.

I showered, changed into an old T-shirt and shorts, and curled up on the couch with my laptop, pretending to look at an article while watching her move around the kitchen. Her shoulders were up. Her movements were too careful. Braced.

When she finally came to the couch, she didn’t tuck herself in under my arm the way she normally did. Instead, she perched at the far end, legs tucked under her, arms folded tightly across her chest as if she were cold.

“Don’t say tired,” I cut in. “You’re behaving like I did something wrong or you did something wrong, and neither of those things fit in a ‘long day’ folder.”

Her throat worked.“I don’t want to… make it a big deal.”

“Too late,” I said, more sharply than I meant to. “We’re already in the ‘weird distance on the couch’ zone. That counts as a big deal in a flat with only two bedrooms.”

She flinched a little. My stomach tightened. This was not going the way I wanted it to. Deep breath.

“Did I do something?” I asked, forcing my voice softer. “Say something? Forget something?”

“No,” she said quickly. “It’s… nothing to do with you. You haven’t done anything.”

“Then *what*?” I pushed. “You pulled away when I kissed you. You’re coiled up over there like a spring. You keep looking at me like you’re about to… I don’t know. Burst into flames?” I pused my lips, huffed. “I can’t fix what I don’t know about, Charli.”

Her fingers dug into the fabric of her leggings. She stared at the blank TV screen.

“I just… need a bit of time,” she whispered.

Something old and hard in me flared at that. The ghost of nights listening to my mother try to pry information out of a man who insisted everything was fine right up until he announced his next unilateral decision.

Time. Silence. Delay.

I took a slow breath, trying not to let that ghost drive.

“Time for *what*?” I asked. “To figure us out? To digest dinner? Because I’m not psychic. If you’ve had a bad day, I want to know. That’s literally part of the job description.”

“I know,” she said. Her eyes were shiny now. “I just… don’t want to be… weak.”

Ah.

“Being honest about something crap that happened isn’t weak,” I said. “Withholding information so I can walk straight into it with both feet is not strength, it’s sabotage.”

The words came out harsher than they sounded in my head.

She recoiled like I’d slapped her.

“Handle *what*, Charli?” My own patience snapped. “There is a line between resilience and shutting down. You can’t keep me out and then punish me for not magically knowing what’s wrong.”

Her face crumpled. She shrank back into the corner of the couch, arms coming up around herself like armour.

“I’m not— I’m not punishing you,” she stammered. “It… it’s just… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”

“Then when?” I demanded. “Tomorrow? Next week? After it’s festered so long you can’t tell if you’re angry at me or at yourself or at someone else entirely? That’s not how we do this, Charli. We don’t train resilience by—”

I stopped.

That wasn’t even my line. It was Mara’s, thrown at Sarah in the early days when Wardrobe had nearly eaten her alive.

*We don’t train resilience by ambush.*

And here I was, *ambushing.*

Charli was fully curled now, knees to chest, breathing shallow. Any thought I’d had about maybe closing the gap between us, touching her, smoothing it over with physical closeness—idiotic. Her whole body was broadcasting NO.

The damage was done, at least for the evening.

“Fine,” I said, standing up because sitting there watching her shrink was increasingly unbearable. “Take all the time you need. I need to do some reading.”

I grabbed my laptop and retreated to the bedroom, feeling like a coward.

An hour later, the article on my screen still hadn’t got past the second paragraph. Every time I got to the word “subjectivity,” my brain swapped in *Charli*, and everything else dissolved.

I could hear the TV through the wall again, barely. The occasional fizz of a text notification. Her, breathing.

My phone buzzed on the bedside table.

**SARAH**:

> Might want to go gentle.
> Remember Mara? we don’t train resilience by ambush.
> xx

For a second, everything in me went very, very still. I closed my eyes, couldn’t breath.

The image appeared in my mind as if on a screen: the loading bay, Charli in that pale cocoa caraco, someone’s hand where it had absolutely no right to be. Her brittle little smile at dinner. The way she’d cringed when I kissed her cheek.

And then, right on top of it, my own voice, cool and righteous: *You can’t keep me out and then punish me…*

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Celeste, you idiot.”

I texted back.

**ME**:

> Thank you.
> I was an idiot.
> Will fix if not too late.
> Mara was right. Again. Obviously.

Sarah’s reply was almost instant.

**SARAH**:

> She’s always right, it’s very annoying.
> You’re not an idiot, you’re just ahead of the curve.
> Trauma brains take longer. Can’t sprint them.

I put the phone down and scrubbed both hands over my face.

Nigel’s ghost was laughing somewhere—that part of me that had learned silence as danger and now treated any lack of immediate disclosure as betrayal. I had promised myself I would never be the person someone else had to tiptoe around with a wound.

And there I was, all combat boots and impatience.

I went back to the lounge.

The TV was still playing something; Charli wasn’t watching it. She was sitting exactly where I’d left her, knees hugged to her chest, eyes fixed on a blank patch of wall. She looked smaller than I’d seen her in a long time.

I turned the TV off with the remote. The sudden quiet made her start. She glanced at me, then back at the floor.

“Charli,” I said softly. “Can I sit?”

Her nod was barely perceptible, eyes flicking to me and away again.

I carefully setttled at the other end of the couch, leaving a deliberate stretch of space between us. Trying to telegraph safety. *Just here.*

“I um— got a text from Sarah just now,” I said. “About what happened with the Queensland rep.”

Her whole body jolted. Her hands flew up to her face.

“She didn’t— I *asked* her not to bother you with that,” she gasped. “It was— it wasn’t— I mean, Sarah *dealt* with it, it’s fine, I should have—”

“Please stop, Charli,” I said, gently but firmly. “Sarah did exactly what she should have done, which was make sure I wasn’t blundering around in the dark like an idiot. Which I was.”

“You’re not an idiot,” she whispered, from behind her hands.

“I am when I expect you to behave like someone who hasn’t just had her boundaries steamrolled in a loading bay,” I said. “I came home and saw you shutting down and instead of thinking, *maybe this wasn’t about me*, my brain went straight to *why won’t she tell me, she knows I love her, I deserve full access.*” My breath came out hard. “Not my proudest moment.”

Her fingers parted a little. I could see her eyes through the gap, wet and wary.

“I just didn’t want to be… dramatic,” she said. “It was just a hand. Sarah sorted it. I thought if I made a fuss you’d think I was—”

“Weak?” I supplied softly.

She nodded, miserably.

I took a breath.

“Charli, I do want you to tell me when something like that happens,” I said, carefully. “Not because I want to control your processing, but because I can’t stomach the idea of you going through it alone ten metres away from me while I piss and moan about lecture slides.”

She winced. “I know you do. It all just… felt so stupid. I was stupid. I smiled. I didn’t say ‘don’t touch me.’ I froze. What if he thought— I mean, maybe it was my fault for being outside in costume and—”

“No,” I said, the word coming out sharper than I meant. “Absolutely not. *Please.* Stop right there.”

She twitched, but she stopped.

“*You* did nothing wrong,” I said again, forcing my voice level. “*You* were at work, in your workplace, doing *your* job, in clothes we put *you* in. He chose to treat *you* like scenery. That’s on *him*. Not on your smile, not on your costume, not on your courtesy.”

“But perhaps I should have—”

“You should have been able to take a fabric delivery without someone turning you into a prop,” I snapped. Then caught myself. “Sorry. I’m not angry *at* you. I’m angry *for* you, and I’m bad at modulating that.”

She let out a shaky laugh that wasn’t really a laugh.

“I just keep thinking,” she said, voice small, “Sarah handled it so well. Calm. Firm. Like she wasn’t… scared. I know I should be like that by now. You’d have told him off every which way but sunday. And I just stood there like a doofus and let my brain turn into soup.”

A light came on. This was the heart of it. She felt like she’d failed some unwritten womanhood exam.

Something in my chest twisted hard enough to hurt.

“Oh, Charli,” I said. “No. This is not a ‘should by now’ situation. You’re not… defective because your nervous system did what nervous systems do under threat.”

“I’m tired of being… the one who shakes into pieces and leaving you trying to reassemble me,” she said. “I want to be someone who doesn’t freeze. Someone like you. Or Mara. Or Sarah. You all seem so—”

“Competent?” I offered. “Practised?”

She nodded.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “We are, unfortunately. Because we *have* to be. Because we’ve had years of this. Some of us—decades. You haven’t. You didn’t grow up being taught to scan every room for exits and hands. You were busy trying to survive being misread in other ways.”

She blinked at that.

“And instead of remembering that key difference in lived experience,” I went on, “I walked in tonight and basically told you off for not bouncing back on my schedule.” My face froze for a moment. The next words felt like gravel in my mouth. I exhaled. “Truth is, I was using old Nigel-shaped baggage as an excuse to demand answers you weren’t ready to give. That’s on me.”

Her eyes filled again.“I don’t want you to feel bad, Celeste,” she said.

“I *do* feel bad,” I said. “Because I scared you more when you were already scared. Because I made this about me—*my* need to know instead of *your* need to feel safe. Because I became the person I promised myself I would never be—the one someone else has to tiptoe around when they’re hurt.”

My throat burned. To my own surprise, my eyes stung.

I looked away, pressed the heel of my hand to my face, and realised, with a small shock, that I was crying.

It wasn’t pretty. I don’t do tears.

And here they were… tears, sudden and hot, spilling over before I’d decided whether I could allow them.

“I’m sorry,” I managed. “I am so, so sorry, Charli. I should have led with ‘are you okay’ and shut up long enough to actually listen. Instead I came in with a checklist and a deadline. Can you forgive me?”

There was a long pause.

Then I felt the cushion dip. She moved, slowly, inching along the couch until her knee bumped my thigh.

“Hey,” she said softly. “Don’t cry. You’re allowed to get it wrong sometimes. You’re not… anything like… him.”

The 'N'-shaped name, shortened to a pronoun, landed with a thud between us.

“I know that,” I sniffed. “But sometimes I can feel… the echo. The part of me that wants clean answers on my timetable because I’ve seen what happens when women wait too long for men to decide. It’s too easy to point that impatience at the wrong person.”

I very gently, very tentatively reached out and touched her cheek.

“Like… you.” My voice cracked. “The one person I should be making it easier for.”

She hesitated, then reached up and covered my hand with hers. Her fingers were still a bit cold, but there was warmth in her intent. Her choice. Our hands fell, entwined.

“I should have told you,” she said quietly. “And I didn’t because… well, there’s no good reason, really. I don’t want to carry that sort of thing by myself anymore. It’s just that I… didn’t have the words yet. My brain was still stuck on ‘it wasn’t that bad’ and ‘I’m overreacting.’”

“And I should have given you the time to find them,” I said. “Instead of trying to drill them out of you like a dentist from hell.”

She huffed a wet little laugh. “That’s a terrible image.”

“I live in terrible images,” I said.

We sat there for a moment, side by side, fingers laced, matching breaths.

Her breathing changed. I glanced at the slight frown on her face.

“Can we…” she started, then faltered. “Can we just… not… be physical tonight? I mean, not in a… sex way. I don’t want you to feel rejected. I just… my skin feels… wrong.”

“Of course,” I said immediately, squeezing her fingers. “We do as much or as little as you want and need. We can sleep back-to-back, we can sleep holding hands, we can put a pillow fort between us like we’re twelve at a sleepover. Whatever feels safest for you.”

She huffed, shoulders lowering a fraction.

“Could we…” she said, cheeks pinking, “maybe just… cuddle tonight, then? No… expectations.”

“Cuddling would be perfect,” I said. “Even though you’ll have to cuddle a clumsy idiot, I’m afraid.”

“All I want is you holding me,” she whispered.

I squeezed her hand again. “Done.”

As we stood up to go to bed, she paused.

“Celeste?”

“Mm?”

“Next time something like that happens,” she said, “I’ll… definitely tell you sooner. Even if it’s messy. Even if I don’t have all the words. I don’t ever want to… freeze you out.”

I nodded. “And next time I see you doing the goldfish stare on the couch, I will start with, ‘I love you, something looks off, do you want to tell me about it now, later, or never?’ in that order. No drills. No ultimatums.”

She smiled, a real one this time. “Deal.”

In bed, we lay on our sides facing each other, foreheads almost touching, breathing the same small pocket of air. No rush, no agenda. Just two women in a too-small bed, trying to unlearn old reflexes and build new ones.

At some point in the dark, with her fingers curled in the fabric of my T-shirt like an anchor, a thought came and settled in my chest:

*Resilience isn’t the speed at which you stop hurting. It’s the certainty that next time, you won’t be alone.*

We were, slowly and clumsily, getting there. Together.

🖤 Resilience by Ambush 💞

[ Celeste ]

By the time I got home, my brain felt like it had been put through a blender labelled *organisational behaviour*.

The flat was warm, lights on soft. I could hear the fan in the bathroom and the faint clink of plates in the kitchen. Charli’s music was on—not loud, just some string serenade from an obscure YouTube channel she’d found. Normally, that sound meant safe: home, food, her.

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my shoes.

“Hey, woman,” I called. “Tell me you made something that didn’t come from a packet.”

“I did,” she said, appearing in the kitchen doorway with a tea towel over one shoulder. “Sort of.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach anything behind her eyes. It didn’t last.

The table was set. Chicken tray bake, salad, the good olive oil. Exactly the kind of sensible, comforting dinner she’d default to when she knew I’d be late. I kissed her cheek as I passed, automatically. Her skin flinched under my mouth in a way most people wouldn’t have noticed.

I noticed.

“You okay?” I asked, pulling out my chair.

“Yeah,” she said too quickly. “Just tired. Long day.”

I sat. So did she. We ate.

It wasn’t that she was silent. That would have been easier to read. She asked about lectures, and I gave her the condensed version—debates, one professor who still thought “woman” was a theoretical category, the usual. She laughed in the right places, nodded in the right places.

But her fork kept missing her mouth by a fraction, like she wasn’t entirely in the room.

“Anything interesting happen at Wardrobe?” I asked at one point, topping up her water.

She froze for half a second. It was so small you could have filed it under cutlery adjustment and moved on. Then she shrugged.

“New fabric delivery,” she said. “Sarah liked the wool for the Les Mis coats. Mara yelled at a spreadsheet. The usual.”

She’d left something out. I could feel the gap like a draught.

“Okay,” I said, letting it slide—for the moment. “We’ll talk coat cuts later. I have Opinions.”

After dinner she insisted on doing the dishes, which was not suspicious in itself—she liked the small, contained task of it—but she brushed off my offer to help with a quick, brittle, “I’ve got it, it’s fine.”

*Fine*, seasoned with that off tone, did not mean it.

I showered, changed into an old T-shirt and shorts, and curled up on the couch with my laptop, pretending to look at an article while watching her move around the kitchen. Her shoulders were up. Her movements were too careful. Braced.

When she finally came to the couch, she didn’t tuck herself in under my arm the way she normally did. Instead, she perched at the far end, legs tucked under her, arms folded tightly across her chest as if she were cold.

We watched something forgettable on Netflix for twenty minutes. Or rather, Netflix talked at us while both of us stared somewhere a few inches in front of our faces.

This was ridiculous.

I shut the laptop and muted the TV.

“Okay,” I said. “Talk to me. What’s going on?”

She startled, eyes flicking to me and away again. “Nothing. I’m just—”

“Don’t say tired,” I cut in. “You’re behaving like I did something wrong or you did something wrong, and neither of those things fit in a ‘long day’ folder.”

Her throat worked.

“I don’t want to… make it a big deal.”

“Too late,” I said, more sharply than I meant to. “We’re already in the ‘weird distance on the couch’ zone. That counts as a big deal in a flat with only two bedrooms.”

She flinched. My stomach tightened. This was not going the way I wanted it to. Deep breath.

“Did I do something?” I asked, forcing my voice softer. “Say something? Forget something?”

“No,” she said quickly. “It’s… nothing to do with you. You haven’t done anything.”

“Then *what*?” I pushed. “You pulled away when I kissed you. You’re coiled up over there like a spring. You keep looking at me like you’re about to… I don’t know. Burst into flames?” I pursed my lips, huffed. “I can’t fix what I don’t know about, Charli.”

Her fingers dug into the fabric of her leggings. She stared at the blank TV screen.

“I just… need a bit of time,” she whispered.

Something old and hard in me flared at that. The ghost of nights listening to my mother try to pry information out of a man who insisted everything was fine right up until he announced his next unilateral decision.

Time. Silence. Delay.

I took a slow breath, trying not to let that ghost drive.

“Time for *what*?” I asked. “To figure us out? To digest dinner? Because I’m not psychic. If you’ve had a bad day, I want to know. That’s literally part of the job description.”

“I know,” she said. Her eyes were shiny now. “I just… don’t want to be… weak.”

Ah.

“Being honest about something crap that happened isn’t weak,” I said. “Withholding information so I can walk straight into it with both feet is not strength, it’s sabotage.”

The words came out harsher than they’d sounded in my head.

She recoiled like I’d slapped her.

“I’m not trying to sabotage anything,” she said, voice cracking. “I’m just— I’m trying to… handle it.”

“Handle *what*, Charli?” My own patience snapped. “There is a line between resilience and shutting down. You can’t keep me out and then punish me for not magically knowing what’s wrong.”

Her face crumpled. She shrank back into the corner of the couch, arms coming up around herself like armour.

“I’m not— I’m not punishing you,” she stammered. “It… it’s just… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”

“Then when?” I demanded. “Tomorrow? Next week? After it’s festered so long you can’t tell if you’re angry at me or at yourself or at someone else entirely? That’s not how we do this, Charli. We don’t train resilience by—”

I stopped.

That wasn’t even my line. It was Mara’s, thrown at Sarah in the early days when Wardrobe had nearly eaten her alive.

*We don’t train resilience by ambush.*

And here I was, *ambushing.*

Charli was fully curled now, knees to chest, breathing shallow. Any thought I’d had about maybe closing the gap between us, touching her, smoothing it over with physical closeness—idiotic. Her whole body was broadcasting NO.

The damage was done, at least for the evening.

“Fine,” I said, standing up because sitting there watching her shrink was increasingly unbearable. “Take all the time you need. I need to do some reading.”

I grabbed my laptop and retreated to the bedroom, feeling like a coward.

---

An hour later, the article on my screen still hadn’t got past the second paragraph. Every time I got to the word “subjectivity,” my brain swapped in *Charli*, and everything else dissolved.

I could barely hear the TV through the wall. The occasional fizz of a text notification. Her, breathing.

My phone buzzed on the bedside table.

**SARAH**:

> Just flagging something before it eats you both.
> Your girl had a run-in with the QLD rep this arvo.
> Hand on her back, too close, all that fun.
> I intervened, he apologised (yeah, right). She shook it off with her mouth but not her eyes.
> She wouldn’t let me call you; said you were too busy.
> Might want to go gentle.
> Remember Mara? we don’t train resilience by ambush.
> xx

For a second, everything in me went very, very still. I closed my eyes, couldn’t breathe.

The image appeared in my mind as if on a screen: the loading bay, Charli in that pale cocoa caraco, someone’s hand where it had absolutely no right to be. Her brittle little smile at dinner. The way she’d cringed when I kissed her cheek.

And then, right on top of it, my own voice, cool and righteous: *You can’t keep me out and then punish me…*

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Celeste, you idiot.”

I texted back.

**ME**:

> Thank you.
> I was an idiot.
> Will fix if not too late.
> Mara was right. Again. Obviously.

Sarah’s reply was almost instant.

**SARAH**:

> She’s always right, it’s very annoying.
> You’re not an idiot, you’re just ahead of the curve.
> Trauma brains take longer. Can’t sprint them.

I put the phone down and scrubbed both hands over my face.

Nigel’s ghost was laughing somewhere—that part of me that had learned silence as danger and now treated any lack of immediate disclosure as betrayal. I had promised myself I would never be the person someone else had to tiptoe around with a wound.

And there I was, all combat boots and impatience.

*Fine*, seasoned with that off tone, did not mean it.

I showered, changed into an old T-shirt and shorts, and curled up on the couch with my laptop, pretending to look at an article while watching her move around the kitchen. Her shoulders were up. Her movements were too careful. Braced.

When she finally came to the couch, she didn’t tuck herself in under my arm the way she normally did. Instead, she perched at the far end, legs tucked under her, arms folded tightly across her chest as if she were cold.

We watched something forgettable on Netflix for twenty minutes. Or rather, Netflix talked at us while both of us stared somewhere a few inches in front of our faces.

This was ridiculous.

I shut the laptop and muted the TV.

“Okay,” I said. “Talk to me. What’s going on?”

She startled, eyes flicking to me and away again. “Nothing. I’m just—”

“Don’t say tired,” I cut in. “You’re behaving like I did something wrong or you did something wrong, and neither of those things fit in a ‘long day’ folder.”

Her throat worked.

“I don’t want to… make it a big deal.”

“Too late,” I said, more sharply than I meant to. “We’re already in the ‘weird distance on the couch’ zone. That counts as a big deal in a flat with only two bedrooms.”

She flinched. My stomach tightened. This was not going the way I wanted it to. Deep breath.

“Did I do something?” I asked, forcing my voice softer. “Say something? Forget something?”

“No,” she said quickly. “It’s… nothing to do with you. You haven’t done anything.”

“Then *what*?” I pushed. “You pulled away when I kissed you. You’re coiled up over there like a spring. You keep looking at me like you’re about to… I don’t know. Burst into flames?” I pursed my lips, huffed. “I can’t fix what I don’t know about, Charli.”

Her fingers dug into the fabric of her leggings. She stared at the blank TV screen.

“I just… need a bit of time,” she whispered.

Something old and hard in me flared at that. The ghost of nights listening to my mother try to pry information out of a man who insisted everything was fine right up until he announced his next unilateral decision.

Time. Silence. Delay.

I took a slow breath, trying not to let that ghost drive.

“Time for *what*?” I asked. “To figure us out? To digest dinner? Because I’m not psychic. If you’ve had a bad day, I want to know. That’s literally part of the job description.”

“I know,” she said. Her eyes were shiny now. “I just… don’t want to be… weak.”

Ah.

“Being honest about something crap that happened isn’t weak,” I said. “Withholding information so I can walk straight into it with both feet is not strength, it’s sabotage.”

The words came out harsher than they’d sounded in my head.

She recoiled like I’d slapped her.

“I’m not trying to sabotage anything,” she said, voice cracking. “I’m just— I’m trying to… handle it.”

“Handle *what*, Charli?” My own patience snapped. “There is a line between resilience and shutting down. You can’t keep me out and then punish me for not magically knowing what’s wrong.”

Her face crumpled. She shrank back into the corner of the couch, arms coming up around herself like armour.

“I’m not— I’m not punishing you,” she stammered. “It… it’s just… I don’t want to talk about it right now.”

“Then when?” I demanded. “Tomorrow? Next week? After it’s festered so long you can’t tell if you’re angry at me or at yourself or at someone else entirely? That’s not how we do this, Charli. We don’t train resilience by—”

I stopped.

That wasn’t even my line. It was Mara’s, thrown at Sarah in the early days when Wardrobe had nearly eaten her alive.

*We don’t train resilience by ambush.*

And here I was, *ambushing.*

Charli was fully curled now, knees to chest, breathing shallow. Any thought I’d had about maybe closing the gap between us, touching her, smoothing it over with physical closeness—idiotic. Her whole body was broadcasting NO.

The damage was done, at least for the evening.

“Fine,” I said, standing up because sitting there watching her shrink was increasingly unbearable. “Take all the time you need. I need to do some reading.”

I grabbed my laptop and retreated to the bedroom, feeling like a coward.

---

An hour later, the article on my screen still hadn’t got past the second paragraph. Every time I got to the word “subjectivity,” my brain swapped in *Charli*, and everything else dissolved.

I could barely hear the TV through the wall. The occasional fizz of a text notification. Her, breathing.

My phone buzzed on the bedside table.

**SARAH**:

> Just flagging something before it eats you both.
> Your girl had a run-in with the QLD rep this arvo.
> Hand on her back, too close, all that fun.
> I intervened, he apologised (yeah, right). She shook it off with her mouth but not her eyes.
> She wouldn’t let me call you; said you were too busy.
> Might want to go gentle.
> Remember Mara? we don’t train resilience by ambush.
> xx

For a second, everything in me went very, very still. I closed my eyes, couldn’t breathe.

The image appeared in my mind as if on a screen: the loading bay, Charli in that pale cocoa caraco, someone’s hand where it had absolutely no right to be. Her brittle little smile at dinner. The way she’d cringed when I kissed her cheek.

And then, right on top of it, my own voice, cool and righteous: *You can’t keep me out and then punish me…*

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Celeste, you idiot.”

I texted back.

**ME**:

> Thank you.
> I was an idiot.
> Will fix if not too late.
> Mara was right. Again. Obviously.

Sarah’s reply was almost instant.

**SARAH**:

> She’s always right, it’s very annoying.
> You’re not an idiot, you’re just ahead of the curve.
> Trauma brains take longer. Can’t sprint them.

I put the phone down and scrubbed both hands over my face.

Nigel’s ghost was laughing somewhere—that part of me that had learned silence as danger and now treated any lack of immediate disclosure as betrayal. I had promised myself I would never be the person someone else had to tiptoe around with a wound.

And there I was, all combat boots and impatience.

I went back to the lounge.

The TV was still playing something; Charli wasn’t watching it. She was sitting exactly where I’d left her, knees hugged to her chest, eyes fixed on a blank patch of wall. She looked smaller than I’d seen her in a long time.

I turned the TV off with the remote. The sudden quiet made her start. She glanced at me, then back at the floor.

“Charli,” I said softly. “Can I sit?”

Her nod was barely perceptible, eyes flicking to me and away again.

I carefully settled at the other end of the couch, leaving a deliberate stretch of space between us. Trying to telegraph safety. *Just here.*

“I, um… got a text from Sarah just now,” I said. “About what happened with the Queensland rep.”

Her whole body jolted. Her hands flew up to her face.

“She didn’t— I *asked* her not to bother you with that,” she gasped. “It was— it wasn’t— I mean, Sarah *dealt* with it, it’s fine, I should have—”

“Please stop, Charli,” I said, gently but firmly. “Sarah did exactly what she should have done, which was make sure I wasn’t blundering around in the dark like an idiot. Which I was.”

“You’re not an idiot,” she whispered, from behind her hands.

“I am when I expect you to behave like someone who hasn’t just had her boundaries steamrolled in a loading bay,” I said. “I came home and saw you shutting down and instead of thinking, *maybe this wasn’t about me*, my brain went straight to *why won’t she tell me, she knows I love her, I deserve full access.*” My breath came out hard. “Not my proudest moment.”

Her fingers parted a little. I could see her eyes through the gap, wet and wary.

“I just didn’t want to be… dramatic,” she said. “It was just a hand. Sarah sorted it. I thought if I made a fuss you’d think I was—”

“Weak?” I supplied softly.

She nodded, miserably.

I took a breath.

“Charli, I do want you to tell me when something like that happens,” I said, carefully. “Not because I want to control your processing, but because I can’t stomach the idea of you going through it alone ten metres away from me while I whinge about lecture slides.”

She winced. “I know you do. It all just… felt so stupid. I was stupid. I smiled. I didn’t say ‘don’t touch me.’ I froze. What if he thought— I mean, maybe it was my fault for being outside in costume and—”

“No,” I said, the word coming out sharper than I meant. “Absolutely not. *Please.* Stop right there.”

She twitched, but she stopped.

“*You* did nothing wrong,” I said again, forcing my voice level. “*You* were at work, in your workplace, doing *your* job, in clothes we put *you* in. He chose to treat *you* like scenery. That’s on *him*. Not on your smile, not on your costume, not on your courtesy.”

“But perhaps I should have—”

“You should have been able to take a fabric delivery without someone turning you into a prop,” I snapped. Then caught myself. “Sorry. I’m not angry *at* you. I’m angry *for* you, and I’m bad at modulating that.”

She let out a shaky laugh that wasn’t really a laugh.

“I just keep thinking,” she said, voice small, “Sarah handled it so well. Calm. Firm. Like she wasn’t… scared. I know I should be like that by now. You’d have told him off every which way but Sunday. And I just stood there like a doofus and let my brain turn into soup.”

A light came on. This was the heart of it. She felt like she’d failed some unwritten womanhood exam.

Something in my chest twisted hard enough to hurt.

“Oh, Charli,” I said. “No. This is not a ‘should by now’ situation. You’re not… defective because your nervous system did what nervous systems do under threat.”

“I’m tired of being… the one who shakes into pieces and leaving you trying to reassemble me,” she said. “I want to be someone who doesn’t freeze. Someone like you. Or Mara. Or Sarah. You all seem so—”

“Competent?” I offered. “Practised?”

She nodded.

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “We are, unfortunately. Because we *have* to be. Because we’ve had years of this. Some of us—decades. You haven’t. You didn’t grow up being taught to scan every room for exits and hands. You were busy trying to survive being misread in other ways.”

She blinked at that.

“And instead of remembering that key difference in lived experience,” I went on, “I walked in tonight and basically told you off for not bouncing back on my schedule.” My face went stiff. The next words felt like gravel in my mouth. I exhaled. “Truth is, I was using old Nigel-shaped baggage as an excuse to demand answers you weren’t ready to give. That’s on me.”

Her eyes filled again.

“I don’t want you to feel bad, Celeste,” she said.

“I *do* feel bad,” I said. “Because I scared you more when you were already scared. Because I made this about me—*my* need to know—instead of *your* need to feel safe. Because I became the person I promised myself I would never be—the one someone else has to tiptoe around when they’re hurt.”

My throat burned. To my own surprise, my eyes stung.

I looked away, pressed the heel of my hand to my face, and realised, with a small shock, that I was crying.

It wasn’t pretty. I don’t do tears.

And here they were—sudden and hot, spilling over before I’d decided whether I could allow them.

“I’m sorry,” I managed. “I am so, so sorry, Charli. I should have led with ‘are you okay’ and shut up long enough to actually listen. Instead I came in with a checklist and a deadline. Can you forgive me?”

There was a long pause.

Then I felt the cushion dip. She moved, slowly, inching along the couch until her knee bumped my thigh.

“Hey,” she said softly. “Don’t cry. You’re allowed to get it wrong sometimes. You’re not… anything like… him.”

The N-shaped name, shortened to a pronoun, landed with a thud between us.

“I know that,” I sniffed. “But sometimes I can feel… the echo. The part of me that wants clean answers on my timetable because I’ve seen what happens when women wait too long for men to decide. It’s too easy to point that impatience at the wrong person.”

I very gently, very tentatively reached out and touched her cheek.

“Like… you.” My voice cracked. “The one person I should be making it easier for.”

She hesitated, then reached up and covered my hand with hers. Her fingers were still a bit cold, but there was warmth in her intent. Her choice. Our hands fell, entwined.

“I should have told you,” she said quietly. “And I didn’t because… well, there’s no good reason, really. I don’t want to carry that sort of thing by myself anymore. It’s just that I… didn’t have the words yet. My brain was still stuck on ‘it wasn’t that bad’ and ‘I’m overreacting.’”

“And I should have given you the time to find them,” I said. “Instead of trying to drill them out of you like a dentist from hell.”

She huffed a wet little laugh. “That’s a terrible image.”

“I live in terrible images,” I said.

We sat there for a moment, side by side, fingers laced, matching breaths.

Her breathing changed. I glanced at the slight frown on her face.

“Can we…” she started, then faltered. “Can we just… not… be physical tonight? I mean, not in a… sex way. I don’t want you to feel rejected. I just… my skin feels… wrong.”

“Of course,” I said immediately, squeezing her fingers. “We do as much or as little as you want and need. We can sleep back-to-back, we can sleep holding hands, we can put a pillow fort between us like we’re twelve at a sleepover. Whatever feels safest for you.”

She huffed, shoulders lowering a fraction.

“Could we…” she said, cheeks pinking, “maybe just… cuddle tonight, then? No… expectations.”

“Cuddling would be perfect,” I said. “Even though you’ll have to cuddle a clumsy idiot, I’m afraid.”

“All I want is you holding me,” she whispered.

I squeezed her hand again. “Done.”

As we stood up to go to bed, she paused.

“Celeste?”

“Mm?”

“Next time something like that happens,” she said, “I’ll… definitely tell you sooner. Even if it’s messy. Even if I don’t have all the words. I don’t ever want to… freeze you out.”

I nodded. “And next time I see you doing the goldfish stare on the couch, I will start with, ‘I love you, something looks off, do you want to tell me about it now, later, or never?’ in that order. No drills. No ultimatums.”

She smiled, a real one this time. “Deal.”

In bed, we lay on our sides facing each other, foreheads almost touching, breathing the same small pocket of air. No rush, no agenda. Just two women in a too-small bed, trying to unlearn old reflexes and build new ones.

At some point in the dark, with her fingers curled in the fabric of my T-shirt like an anchor, a thought came and settled in my chest:

*Resilience isn’t the speed at which you stop hurting. It’s the certainty that next time, you won’t be alone.*

We were, slowly and clumsily, getting there. Together.

🖤 Resilience by Ambush 💞
[ Celeste ]

By the time I got home, my brain felt like it had been put through a blender labelled organisational behaviour.

The flat was warm, lights on soft. I could hear the fan in the bathroom and the faint clink of plates in the kitchen. Charli’s music was on—not loud, just some string serenade from an obscure YouTube channel she’d found. Normally, that sound meant safe: home, food, her.

I dropped my bag by the door and kicked off my shoes.

“Hey, woman,” I called. “Tell me you made something that didn’t come from a packet.”

“I did,” she said, appearing in the kitchen doorway with a tea towel over one shoulder. “Sort of.”

She smiled, but it didn’t reach anything behind her eyes. And it didn’t last.

The table was set. Chicken tray bake, salad, the good olive oil. Exactly the kind of sensible, comforting dinner she’d default to when she knew I’d be late. I kissed her cheek as I passed, automatically. Her skin flinched under my mouth in a way most people wouldn’t have noticed.

I noticed.

“You okay?” I asked, pulling out my chair.

“Yeah,” she said too quickly. “Just tired. Long day.”

I sat. So did she. We ate.

It wasn’t that she was silent. That would have been easier to read. She asked about lectures, and I gave her the condensed version—debates, one professor who still thought “woman” was a theoretical category, the usual. She laughed in the right places, nodded in the right places.

But her fork kept missing her mouth by a fraction, like she wasn’t entirely in the room.

“Anything interesting happen at Wardrobe?” I asked at one point, topping up her water.

She froze for half a second. It was so small you could have filed it under cutlery adjustment and moved on. Then she shrugged.

“New fabric delivery,” she said. “Sarah liked the wool for the Les Mis coats. Mara yelled at a spreadsheet. The usual.”

She’d left something out. I could feel the gap like a draught.

“Okay,” I said, letting it slide—for the moment. “We’ll talk coat cuts later. I have Opinions.”

After dinner she insisted on doing the dishes, which was not suspicious in itself—she liked the small, contained task of it—but she brushed off my offer to help with a quick, brittle, “I’ve got it, it’s fine.”

Fine, seasoned with that off tone, did not mean it.

I showered, changed into an old T-shirt and shorts, and curled up on the couch with my laptop, pretending to look at an article while watching her move around the kitchen. Her shoulders were up. Her movements were too careful. Braced.

When she finally came to the couch, she didn’t tuck herself in under my arm the way she normally did. Instead, she perched at the far end, legs tucked under her, arms folded tightly across her chest as if she were cold.

We watched something forgettable on Netflix for twenty minutes. Or rather, Netflix talked at us while both of us stared somewhere a few inches in front of our faces.

She flinched. My stomach tightened. This was not going the way I wanted it to. Deep breath.

“Did I do something?” I asked, forcing my voice softer. “Say something? Forget something?”

“No,” she said quickly. “It’s… nothing to do with you. You haven’t done anything.”

“Then what?” I pushed. “You pulled away when I kissed you. You’re coiled up over there like a spring. You keep looking at me like you’re about to… I don’t know. Burst into flames?” I pursed my lips, huffed. “I can’t fix what I don’t know about, Charli.”

Her fingers dug into the fabric of her leggings. She stared at the blank TV screen.

“I just… need a bit of time,” she whispered.

Time. Silence. Delay.

I took a slow breath, trying not to let that ghost drive.

“Time for what?” I asked. “To figure us out? To digest dinner? Because I’m not psychic. If you’ve had a bad day, I want to know. That’s literally part of the job description.”

“I know,” she said. Her eyes were shiny now. “I just… don’t want to be… weak.”

Ah.

“Being honest about something crap that happened isn’t weak,” I said. “Withholding information so I can walk straight into it with both feet is not strength, it’s sabotage.”

I stopped.

That wasn’t even my line. It was Mara’s, thrown at Sarah in the early days when Wardrobe had nearly eaten her alive.

We don’t train resilience by ambush.

And here I was, ambushing.

Charli was fully curled now, knees to chest, breathing shallow. Any thought I’d had about maybe closing the gap between us, touching her, smoothing it over with physical closeness—idiotic. Her whole body was broadcasting NO.

I could barely hear the TV through the wall. The occasional fizz of a text notification. Her, breathing.

My phone buzzed on the bedside table.

Sarah:

Just flagging something before it eats you both.

Your girl had a run-in with the QLD rep this arvo.

Hand on her back, too close, all that fun.

I intervened, he apologised. Yeah, right. She shook it off with her mouth but not her eyes.

She wouldn’t let me call you; said you were too busy.

Might want to go gentle.

Remember Mara? we don’t train resilience by ambush.

xx

For a second, everything in me went very, very still. I closed my eyes, couldn’t breathe.

The image appeared in my mind as if on a screen: the loading bay, Charli in that pale cocoa caraco, someone’s hand where it had absolutely no right to be. Her brittle little smile at dinner. The way she’d cringed when I kissed her cheek.

And then, right on top of it, my own voice, cool and righteous: You can’t keep me out and then punish me…

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Celeste, you idiot.”

I texted back.

Me:

Thank you.

I was an idiot.

Will fix if not too late.

Mara was right. Again. Obviously.

Sarah’s reply was almost instant.

Sarah:

She’s always right, it’s very annoying.

You’re not an idiot, you’re just ahead of the curve.

Trauma brains take longer. Can’t sprint them.

I put the phone down and scrubbed both hands over my face.

Nigel’s ghost was laughing somewhere—that part of me that had learned silence as danger and now treated any lack of immediate disclosure as betrayal. I had promised myself I would never be the person someone else had to tiptoe around with a wound.

I very gently, very tentatively reached out and touched her cheek.

“Like… you.” My voice cracked. “The one person I so want to be making life easier for.”

She hesitated, then reached up and covered my hand with hers. Her fingers were still a bit cold, but there was warmth in her eyes. And forgiveness.



Our hands fell, entwined.

“I should have told you,” she said quietly. “And I didn’t because… well, there’s no good reason, really. It’s just that I… didn’t have the words yet. My brain was still stuck on ‘it wasn’t that bad’ and ‘I’m overreacting.’” She swallowed. “But I don’t want to carry that sort of thing by myself anymore.”

“Look, I should have given you the time to find the words,” I said. “Instead of trying to drill them out of you like a dentist from hell.”

She huffed a wet little laugh. “That’s a terrible image.”

“I live in terrible images,” I said.

We sat there for a moment, side by side, fingers laced, matching breaths.

Her breathing changed. I glanced at the slight frown on her face.

“Can we…” she started, then faltered. “Can we just… not… be physical tonight? I mean, not in a… sex way. I just don’t want you to feel rejected. My skin still feels… wrong.”

“Of course,” I said immediately, squeezing her fingers. “We do as much or as little as you want and need. We can sleep back-to-back, we can sleep holding hands, we can put a pillow fort between us like we’re twelve at a sleepover. Whatever feels safest for you.”

She huffed, shoulders lowering a fraction.

“Could we…” she said, cheeks pinking, “maybe… cuddle tonight, then?”

“Cuddling would be perfect,” I said. “Even though you’ll have to cuddle a clumsy idiot, I’m afraid.”

“All I want is you holding me,” she whispered.

I squeezed her hand again. “Done.”

As we stood up to go to bed, she paused.

“Celeste?”

“Mm?”

“Next time something like that happens,” she said, “I’ll… definitely tell you sooner. Even if it’s messy. Even if I don’t have all the words. I don’t ever want to… freeze you out.”

I nodded. “And next time I see you doing the goldfish stare on the couch, I will start with, ‘I love you, something looks off, do you want to tell me about it now, later, or never?’ in that order. No drills. No ultimatums.”

She smiled, a real one this time. “Deal.”

In bed, we lay on our sides facing each other, foreheads almost touching, breathing the same small pocket of air. No rush, no agenda. Just two women in a too-small bed, trying to unlearn old reflexes and build new ones.

At some point in the dark, with her fingers curled in the fabric of my T-shirt like an anchor, a thought came and settled in my chest:

Resilience isn’t the speed at which you stop hurting. It’s the certainty that next time, you won’t be alone.

We were, slowly and clumsily, getting there. Together.
