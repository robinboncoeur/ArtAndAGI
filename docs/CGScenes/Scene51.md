**Scene 49 — “Consequences” (Celeste POV)**

I waited until lunch.

Not because I wanted to punish her with time.

Because if I spoke too soon, my voice would carry the wrong emotion.

I needed to be the adult.

And—this was the new part—I needed to be the adult while my body still wanted her hands on my skin.

That was the discipline now.

After lunch, I sent Charli a single message.

**Back room. Five minutes.**

No emoji. No softness. Structure.

Charli arrived exactly on time, of course.

She stood just inside the door like a schoolgirl, shoulders tight, hands clasped in front of her as if her fingers couldn’t be trusted.

Her eyes were red-rimmed. She’d tried not to cry. She’d failed. Quietly.

I didn’t comment on it.

I leaned against the table and kept my face calm.

“What happened this morning,” I said, “was unsafe.”

Charli flinched.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“No,” I said, and held up a hand. “Not that word. You don’t apologise to make yourself feel smaller. You listen.”

Charli’s mouth closed. She nodded once, hard.

I continued, steady.

“Wardrobe is a women’s workplace. It is a safe space by design. That design depends on two things: privacy and clarity.”

Charli stared at the floor, breathing shallowly.

“You touched me in a way that signalled intimacy,” I said. “In front of staff. In front of a client.”

Charli’s throat moved. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to signal—”

“I know,” I said, and my voice softened *one notch* because it was true. “But intent is not the point.”

Her head lifted slightly, eyes wet.

“The point,” I continued, “is consequences. In a room like ours, intimacy becomes currency for other people. Gossip. Leverage. Narratives. And women pay for that.”

Charli’s face crumpled, not theatrically—just honest pain.

“I didn’t think,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said again. “That’s why we’re talking.”

I pushed off the table and stepped closer—not to comfort her, but to anchor her with fact.

“This is not me rejecting you,” I said, very clearly. “This is me protecting you. And protecting Wardrobe.”

Charli’s eyes snapped up.

“You’re… not…?” Her voice broke.

I held her gaze.

“No,” I said. “I’m not.”

She exhaled shakily, as if she’d been holding her breath since morning.

Then the devotion returned—too fast, too eager—and she stepped forward like she wanted to touch me to confirm it.

I stopped her with a small gesture.

Charli froze.

I let the silence do its work.

“This is part of being a woman in a women’s space,” I said. “You don’t get to let your feelings spill wherever they want. You learn where it’s safe.”

Charli nodded rapidly, tears slipping now.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can. I will.”

“Good,” I said.

Then I delivered the consequence, clean and boring, like policy.

“For the next two weeks,” I said, “you and I behave at work as we always have. Professional. No private signals. No touches. No looks that linger. We don’t feed anyone a story.”

Charli’s face tightened in fear.

Two weeks must have sounded like exile.

I watched her carefully.

“This is not punishment,” I added, because I meant it. “It’s training. It’s protection. It’s a reset.”

Charli swallowed.

“Yes,” she whispered, and I could see her trying to be brave.

“And,” I continued, “if you feel the urge to touch me at work, you redirect it into craft.”

Charli blinked.

I nodded toward the shelves.

“Pins,” I said. “Ties. Tension. You put your devotion into the work. That is how women survive in public.”

Charli’s breath shuddered.

“Yes,” she said again, steadier this time. “I understand.”

I held her gaze for a long beat, then—because I am not cruel—I gave her one truthful softness.

“Last night,” I said quietly, “was real.”

Charli’s eyes filled again, but this time the tears looked like relief.

“And it will continue,” I added. “At home. After hours. Where it is safe.”

Charli nodded, trembling.

“Yes,” she breathed. “I’ll be good.”

I sighed—small, controlled.

“Don’t say ‘good’ like that,” I said. “Say ‘careful.’”

Charli swallowed, corrected herself.

“I’ll be careful.”

“Better,” I said.

I stepped back and opened the door.

“Now,” I said, returning to the adult voice, “wash your face. Fix your posture. Go back out there. You’re not in trouble. You’re learning.”

Charli wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand, nodded, and turned to go.

At the doorway she paused—hesitated—then looked back at me with a question in her eyes.

Not asking for touch.

Asking for certainty.

I gave her a small nod.

The kind that says: *We are still us. Just not here.*

Charli exhaled and went back into Wardrobe.

I closed the door and stood alone in the back room for a moment longer than necessary, letting the ache in my chest settle into something I could carry.

Because this was the new truth:

I wanted her.

I wanted her touch.

And I would still choose the standards that kept her safe.

Even when it hurt.

Especially when it hurt.

---

If you like, the next scene can be the *evening after this consequence talk* — where Charli, determined to “be careful,” becomes **almost comically** cautious… and Celeste has to guide her back into softness: *“Careful doesn’t mean distant.”* That’s a gorgeous way to show Celeste’s floodgates staying open **in the correct place**. 💛

[26-02-16] (written on 16th)

[ Sarah ]

The first thing that told me something was wrong was the silence.

Not actual silence — we never got that at Wardrobe — but a wrong-shaped pocket of quiet cutting through the usual noise: irons, chatter, the whirr of the overlocker, Charli’s little humming when she thought nobody could hear.

The humming had stopped.

I was at the pressing station, flattening a sleeve head that had decided to be clever, when the sound from the loading area went thin. A man’s laugh. Charli’s voice, light and pitched up half a notch higher than usual.

No.

I put the iron down, face-first on the rest. It hissed like it disapproved. I stepped away anyway.

From the workroom you could see the loading bay through the long glass door: a rectangle of outside light, the back of the van, the courier signing off. And just beyond, near the stacked calico rolls — Charli.

She was in the new caraco test: pale blue, pinned at the back with glass-headed pins so we could mark the seams properly. Petticoat, short gown, fichu. Hair up in that messy knot Celeste liked, the one that made her look like she’d just stepped out of an 18th-century painting and into our carpark.

And next to her: a young bloke in a company polo, clipboard under one arm, leaning much too far into her space.

He had that Queensland tradie look — sun-lean, confident, tan line where his sunnies usually sat. Good teeth, good skin, good posture. The kind of man who’d never had to think too hard about his body in relation to other people’s.

His hand was on the back of her caraco, fingers spread, “admiring the cut.”

Charli’s smile had gone brittle. The set of her shoulders was wrong: forward, curved, shrinking herself away even as she stood still.

There it was. The little snap in my spine.

I didn’t think about it; I moved. Through the workroom, past the cutting table, out the glass door into the loading bay, where the light was harsher and the air smelled of dust and diesel and new fabric.

“Everything all right out here?” I asked, cheerfully, which for me was usually a warning.

Charli’s eyes flicked to me. Too quick. Too relieved.

“Fine,” she said. Too fast. “We’re just— uh—”

“Talking about fabric,” the bloke cut in. His hand was still on the back of her gown. “I was just saying how soft this is. Real nice.” His thumb rubbed a little circle into the silk at her shoulder blade as if to prove his point.

I felt my jaw go tight.

“Hands off the sample, please,” I said, still in that bright, customer-facing tone. “Those pins bite.”

He glanced at me properly then, taking in the apron, the chalk, the way I was standing. Deciding if I counted.

“Relax,” he said, letting his hand slide down an inch before he took it away. That inch was enough to brush the small of Charli’s back on the way. “We’re just having a chat. Aren’t we, love?”

Charli made a small, strangled sound that might have been agreement.

And that — more than the hand, more than the “love” — was what did it. That tiny, automatic appease-reflex she had when men pushed past her boundaries.

I stepped closer, into his line of sight, between him and the door back to the workroom. Not touching, just… there.

“We appreciate the shipment being on time,” I said. “And the order. Truly. But you don’t touch my staff. Not the samples, not the women in them.”

He laughed again, but there was a new edge to it now. “Your staff,” he said. “Right. I thought this was, like, a fun place. Everyone keeps telling us how ‘immersive’ it is. I’m just getting into the spirit, yeah?”

“Here’s the thing,” I said. “The spirit is optional. Consent isn’t.”

His smile slipped, just a fraction. “You’re overreacting.”

“Am I.” I let the words sit, flat and calm. “You’re from the Queensland group, aren’t you? The one putting through the multi-season hire? We’ve seen the spreadsheets.”

He straightened a bit at that. Men like him had radar for the word “big account.”

“Well, yeah,” he said. “Which is why I’m here. Making sure you lot are up to delivering. We’re bringing you business, you know?”

“You are,” I agreed. “But you’re not bringing it to my staff’s backs.”

His eyes narrowed. “Come on. I just touched the fabric.”

“You touched the woman inside it,” I said. “Without asking. While she was doing her job. That’s not flirting. That’s you testing how much of our goodwill you can spend before anyone says anything.”

He opened his mouth, shut it again. I watched him process “said out loud” like it was a language he hadn’t expected us to know.

From the corner of my eye, I saw the courier slink towards his van, papers signed, not wanting any part of this.

“Look,” the bloke said, shifting his weight. “Maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I’m Mick. We’re going to be working together for months, so how about we all take a breath and not make this a *thing*, yeah?”

“It is already a thing,” I said. “But here’s your lucky day: you get a reset. You step back, you apologise to Charli, and you remember that costumed women are not part of the attractions. They’re the ones making sure your attractions don’t fall apart on stage.”

His jaw worked. Apologise, or lose face. Lose face, or potentially lose the good relationship with the strange, highly competent women making the very expensive clothes his bosses had signed off on.

“You’re serious,” he said.

“Very,” I replied. “And if you’d like to take it up with management, I can fetch Mara. She’s much less patient than I am.”

That landed. Men always underestimate Mara until she’s in front of them, all height and clipped vowels and ledger numbers.

He swallowed.

Then — slowly, like it hurt — he turned to Charli.

“Sorry,” he said. It came out gruff, not gracious. “Didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

Charli blinked, as if the words were something she had to translate. “Okay,” she said. Her hands were twisting in the folds of her petticoat. “Thank you.”

I filed that away for later: we were going to have a talk about “okay” not being mandatory.

I gave him a thin smile. “Great. Now that we’ve done the basic human decency part of the meeting, we can move on to the fabric.”

He shifted his clipboard, defensive. “Like I said, we’re happy so far. The samples look good. Our people were impressed with the first batch. We just want to make sure you can scale.”

“We can,” I said. “What we can’t do is work with people who treat our staff like set dressing. You bring respect, we’ll bring miracles. Otherwise, there are other companies who’d be thrilled to take your slot.”

The words hung there between us: we don’t need you enough to eat this.

He looked back at the rolls of cloth, then at the open bay door, the glimpses of the workroom beyond — women moving with purpose, the controlled chaos of it, the confidence.

Something shifted behind his eyes. Not enlightenment, not yet. Just the realisation that this particular game wasn’t going to play the way he was used to.

“Right,” he said finally. “Message received.”

“Good,” I said. “Charli, do you want to finish the check-in form? Or shall I?”

She drew in a breath, straightened her shoulders inside the caraco, and reached for the clipboard.

“I can do it,” she said. Her voice was steadier now. “It’s my order.”

“That’s my girl,” I said, and stepped just enough aside that she had room, but not so far he could slip back in.

We went through the rest — signatures, quantities, boring details — in a crisp, professional rhythm. Mick kept his hands strictly to himself. When it was done, he gave a short nod that wasn’t quite respectful yet but was heading in that direction.

“I’ll let the office know everything arrived,” he said. “We’ll need those first fittings in two weeks.”

“You’ll have them,” I said. “Assuming nothing unexpected touches my staff in the meantime.”

He winced at that, faintly, but didn’t argue. “See you at the next drop, then.”

He climbed into the van, started the engine, and drove off.

Only when the sound of it faded did I turn to Charli.

She’d gone a little grey around the edges, the way she did after fittings that got too intense or crowds that pressed too close. Her hands were trembling just enough to make the pins quiver in the back of the caraco.

“Come on,” I said, gentler now. “Inside. Before I have to explain to Celeste why you passed out in the loading bay in her favourite jacket.”

She gave a weak huff of a laugh and let me herd her back through the glass door.

Once it was shut behind us, the workroom noise wrapped around us again — safe, familiar. The girls looked up, clocked the look on my face, and then, importantly, didn’t crowd. They trusted I’d handle it and loop them in later.

I steered Charli over to a stool near the pressing station and sat her down.

“You did nothing wrong,” I said, directly. “Start there.”

Her eyes filled, stupidly fast. “I should’ve said something sooner,” she whispered. “I just… froze. And then I thought if I smiled he’d go away, but he didn’t, and—”

“And that is exactly why men like that pick women like you,” I cut in, not unkindly. “Because you’re polite and you were working and you were pinned into a jacket that doesn’t even have proper sleeves yet, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with. That’s on him. Not you.”

She blinked harder. One tear made a reckless dash anyway.

“I don’t want to make trouble,” she said. “What if they cancel the order?”

“Then they cancel the order,” I said. “We will survive. I am never going to ask you to trade your safety for a contract.”

She looked up at me as if I’d just announced we’d decided to work in zero gravity.

“Really?” she said.

“Yes, really,” I replied. “This is Wardrobe. We make women feel like they belong in their clothes and in their lives. That starts with the women who sew the hems.”

She let out a shaky breath. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” I said. “Next time someone puts a hand on you without asking, you say ‘Don’t touch me’ in your rehearsal voice. And if your throat closes, you make eye contact with whoever’s nearest and we will do the rest. Understood?”

She nodded. “Understood.”

“And, Charli?” I added.

“Mm?”

“You know that thing where you call yourself ‘a trouble’ every time someone else behaves badly?”

She winced. “Yes.”

“Retire it,” I said. “We’ve got enough mending to do without unpicking that as well.”

That got me a ghost of a real smile.

“Okay,” she said. “I’ll… try.”

“Good girl,” I said, and picked up my iron again, letting the hiss of steam mark the end of the conversation, for now.

Outside, somewhere between here and Queensland, a man was rehearsing a story in which he’d been unfairly told off by a bunch of intense women in a costume shop.

Inside, we were getting on with the work.

From the workroom you could see the loading bay through the long glass door: a rectangle of outside light, the back of the van, the courier signing off. And just beyond, near the stacked calico rolls—Charli.

She was in the new caraco test: light cocoa, pinned at the back with glass-headed pins so we could mark the seams properly. Petticoat, short gown, fichu. Hair up in that messy knot Celeste liked, the one that made her look like she’d just stepped out of an 18th-century painting and into our carpark.

His hand was on the back of her caraco, fingers spread, “admiring the cut.”

Charli’s smile had gone, fullstop. The set of her shoulders was wrong: forward, curved, shrinking herself away even as she stood still.

There it was. The little snap in my spine.

**[Sarah – loading bay scene]**

The first thing that told me something was wrong was the silence.

Not actual silence—we never got that at Wardrobe—but a wrong-shaped pocket of quiet in the usual noise: irons hissing, chatter, the whirr of the overlocker, Charli’s little humming when she thought nobody could hear.

I was at the pressing station, flattening a sleeve head that had decided to be clever, when the sound from the loading area went thin. A man’s laugh. Charli’s voice, light and pitched up half a notch higher than usual.

No.

I put the iron down, face-first on the rest. It hissed like it disapproved.

From the workroom you could see the loading bay through the long glass door: a rectangle of outside light, the back of the van, the courier signing off. And just beyond, near the stacked calico rolls—Charli.

She was in the new caraco test: light cocoa, pinned at the back with glass-headed pins so we could mark the seams properly. Petticoat, short gown, fichu. Hair up in that messy knot Celeste liked, the one that made her look like she’d just stepped out of an 18th-century painting and into our carpark.

“Everything all right out here?” I asked, cheerfully—which for me was usually a warning.

Charli’s eyes flicked to me. Too quick. Too relieved.

“Um—fine,” she said. Too fast. “We’re just—uh—”

“Talking about fabric,” the bloke cut in. His hand was still on the back of her gown. “I was just saying how soft this is. Real nice.” His thumb rubbed a little circle into the silk at her shoulder blade as if to prove his point.

My jaw went tight.

“Hands off the sample, please,” I said, still in that bright, customer-facing tone. “Those pins bite.”

He glanced at me properly then, taking in the apron, the chalk, the way I was standing. Deciding if I counted.

“Relax,” he said, letting his hand slide down an inch before he took it away. That inch was enough to brush the small of Charli’s back on the way. “We’re just having a chat. Aren’t we, love?”

Charli made a small, strangled sound that could have been anything but agreement.

And that—more than the hand, more than the “love”—was what did it. That tiny, automatic appease-reflex she had when men pushed past her boundaries.

I stepped closer, into his line of sight, between him and the door back to the workroom. Not touching, just… there.

“We appreciate the shipment being on time,” I said. “And the order. Truly. But you don’t touch my staff. Not the samples, not the women in them.”

He laughed again, but there was a new edge to it now. “Your staff,” he said. “Right. I thought this was, like, a fun place. Everyone keeps telling us how ‘immersive’ it is. I’m just getting into the spirit, yeah?”

“Here’s the thing,” I said. “The spirit is optional. Consent isn’t.”

His smile slipped, just a fraction. “You’re overreacting.”

“Am I.” I let the words sit, flat and calm. “You’re from the Queensland group, aren’t you? The one putting through the multi-season hire? We’ve seen the spreadsheets.”

He straightened a bit at that. Men like him have radar for the words *big account*.

“Well, yeah,” he said. “Which is why I’m here. Making sure you lot are up to delivering. We’re bringing you business, you know?”

“You are,” I agreed. “But you’re not bringing it to my staff’s backs.”

His eyes narrowed. “Come on. I just touched the fabric.”

“You touched the woman inside it,” I said. “Without asking. While she was doing her job. That’s not flirting. That’s you testing how much of our goodwill you can spend before anyone says anything.”

He opened his mouth, shut it again. I watched him process “said out loud” like it was a language he hadn’t expected us to know.

From the corner of my eye, I saw the courier slink towards his van, papers signed, not wanting any part of this.

“Look,” the bloke said, shifting his weight. “Maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I’m Mick. We’re going to be working together for months, so how about we all take a breath and not make this a *thing*, yeah?”

“It is already a thing,” I said. “But here’s your lucky day: you get a reset. You step back, you apologise to Charli, and you remember that costumed women are not part of the attractions. They’re the ones making sure your attractions don’t fall apart on stage.”

His jaw worked. Apologise, or lose face. Lose face, or potentially lose the good relationship with the strange, highly competent women making the very expensive clothes his bosses had signed off on.

“You’re serious.”

“Very,” I replied, steady. “And if you’d like to take it up with management, I can fetch Mara. She’s much less patient than I am.”

That landed. Men always underestimated Mara until she was in front of them, all height and clipped vowels and ledger numbers.

He swallowed.

Then—slowly, like it cost him something—he turned to Charli.

“Sorry,” he said. It came out gruff, not gracious. “Didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”

Charli blinked, as if the words were something she had to translate. “Okay,” she said. Her hands were twisting in the folds of her petticoat. “Thank you.”

I filed that away for later: we were going to have a talk about “okay” not being mandatory.

I gave him a thin smile. “Great. Now that we’ve done the basic human decency part of the meeting, we can move on to the fabric.”

He shifted his clipboard, defensive. “Like I said, we’re happy so far. The samples look good. Our people were impressed with the first batch. We just want to make sure you can scale.”

“We can,” I said. “What we can’t do is work with people who treat our staff like set dressing. You bring respect, we’ll bring miracles. Otherwise, there are other companies who’d be thrilled to take your slot.”

The words hung there between us: *we don’t need you enough to eat this.*

He looked back at the rolls of cloth, then at the open bay door, the glimpses of the workroom beyond—women moving with purpose, the controlled chaos of it, the confidence.

Something shifted behind his eyes. Not enlightenment, not yet. Just the realisation that this particular game wasn’t going to play the way he was used to.

“Right,” he said finally. “Message received.”

“Good,” I said. “Charli, do you want to finish the check-in form? Or shall I?”

She drew in a breath, straightened her shoulders inside the caraco, and reached for the clipboard.

“I can do it,” she said. Her voice was steadier now.

“That’s my girl,” I said, and stepped just enough aside that she had room, but not so far he could slip back in.

We went through the rest—signatures, quantities, boring details—in a crisp, professional rhythm. Mick kept his hands strictly to himself. When it was done, he gave a short nod that wasn’t quite respectful yet but was heading in that direction.

“I’ll let the office know everything arrived,” he said. “We’ll need those first fittings in two weeks.”

“You’ll have them,” I said. “Assuming nothing unexpected touches my staff in the meantime.”

He winced at that, faintly, but didn’t argue. “See you at the next drop, then.”

He climbed into the van, started the engine, and drove off.

Only when the sound of it faded did I turn to Charli.

She’d gone a little grey around the edges, the way she did after fittings that got too intense or crowds that pressed too close. Her hands were trembling just enough to make the pins quiver in the back of the caraco.

“Come on,” I said, gentler now. “Inside. Before I have to explain to Celeste why you passed out in the loading bay in her favourite jacket.”

She gave a weak huff of a laugh and let me herd her back through the glass door.

Once it was shut behind us, the workroom noise wrapped around us again—safe, familiar. The girls looked up, clocked the look on my face, and then, importantly, didn’t crowd. They trusted I’d handle it and loop them in later.

I steered Charli over to a stool near the pressing station and sat her down.

“You did nothing wrong,” I said, directly. “Let’s start there.”

Her eyes filled, stupidly fast. “I should’ve said something sooner,” she whispered. “I just… froze. And then I thought if I smiled he’d go away, but he didn’t, and—”

“And that is exactly why men like that pick women like you,” I cut in, not unkindly. “Because you’re polite and you were working and you were pinned into a jacket that doesn’t even have proper sleeves yet, and he wanted to see how much he could get away with. That’s on him. Not you.”

She blinked harder. One tear made a reckless dash anyway.

“I don’t want to make trouble,” she said. “What if they cancel the order?”

“Then they cancel the order,” I said. “We will survive. Neither Mara nor anyone here would ever ask you to trade your safety for a contract.”

She looked up at me as if I’d just announced we’d decided to work in zero gravity.

“But—” she said.

“No buts, Charli,” I replied. “This is Wardrobe. Women here feel safe—like they belong in their clothes and in their lives. That starts with the women who sew the hems.”

She let out a shaky breath. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” I said. “Next time someone puts a hand on you without asking, you say ‘Don’t touch me’ in your rehearsal voice. And if your throat closes, you make eye contact with whoever’s nearest and we will do the rest. Understood?”

She nodded. “Understood.”

“And, Charli? You know that thing where you call yourself ‘a trouble’ every time someone else behaves badly?”

She winced and looked down. Dipped her head.

“Retire it,” I said. “We’ve got enough mending to do without unpicking that as well.”

That got me a ghost of a real smile.

“Okay,” she said. “I’ll… try.”

“Good girl,” I said, and picked up my iron again, letting the hiss of steam mark the end of the conversation, for now.

Outside, somewhere between here and Queensland, a man was rehearsing a story in which he’d been unfairly told off by a bunch of intense women in a costume shop.

Inside, we were getting on with the work.

The first thing that told me something was wrong was the silence.

Not actual silence—we never got that at Wardrobe—but a wrong-shaped pocket of quiet in the usual noise: irons hissing, chatter, the whirr of the overlocker, Charli’s little humming when she thought nobody could hear. I had heard her earlier, outside, in the loading area.

The humming had stopped.

I was at the pressing station, flattening a sleeve head that had decided to be clever, when the sound from the loading area went thin. A man’s laugh. Charli’s voice, light and pitched up half a notch higher than usual.

No.

I put the iron down, face-first on the rest. It hissed like it disapproved.

From the workroom you could see the loading bay through the long glass door: a rectangle of outside light, the back of the van, the courier signing off. And just beyond, near the stacked calico rolls—Charli.

She was in the new caraco test: light cocoa, pinned at the back with glass-headed pins so we could mark the seams properly. Petticoat, short gown, fichu. Hair up in that messy knot Celeste liked, the one that made her look like she’d just stepped out of an 18th-century painting and into our carpark.

And next to her: a young bloke wearing a cheap company business suit and a confident grin, clipboard under one arm, leaning much too far into her space.

He had that Queensland tradie-come-good look—sun-lean, confident, tan line where his sunnies usually sat. Good teeth, good skin, good posture. The kind of man who’d never had to think too hard about his body in relation to other people’s.

His hand was on the back of her caraco, fingers spread, “admiring the cut.”

Charli’s smile had gone, full stop. The set of her shoulders was wrong: forward, curved, shrinking herself away even as she stood still.

It set off a little snap in my spine.

I didn’t think about it; I moved. Through the workroom, past the cutting table, out the glass door into the loading bay, where the light was harsher and the air smelled of dust and diesel and new fabric.

“Everything all right out here?” I asked, cheerfully—which for me was usually a warning.

Charli’s eyes flicked to me. Too quick. Too relieved.

“Um—fine,” she said. Too fast. “We’re just—uh—”

“Talking about fabric,” the bloke cut in, still grinning. His hand was still on the back of her gown. “I was just saying how soft this is. Real nice.” His thumb rubbed a little circle into the silk at her shoulder blade as if to prove his point.

Charli made a small, strangled sound that could have been anything but agreement.

“We can,” I said. “What we can’t do is work with people who treat our staff like set dressing. You bring respect, we’ll bring miracles. Otherwise, there are other companies who’d be thrilled to take your custom.”

The words hung there between us.

We don’t need you enough to eat this.
