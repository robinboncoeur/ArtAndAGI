**Scene 28 — “Ours” (Sarah POV)**

The thing about a pronoun shift, when it’s real, is you don’t notice it after a while.

It becomes like the hum of the fridge. Present. Constant. You only notice it when it stops.

A week passes. Then another. The Faire girls keep drifting through for fittings, repairs, re-pins, last-minute panics. Wardrobe is a tide pool of women—skirts lifted, hair pinned, laughter breaking like sunlight through steam.

And Charli is in the middle of it more and more.

Not like she’s performing. Not like she’s begging.

Just… included.

It starts with the little things. The things blokes never notice because they don’t do them.

Tahlia offers her a hair tie without asking why she needs it. Lucy slides a spare thimble across the table when Charli’s fingers are raw from hand-stitching. Someone hands her lip balm. Someone else asks, casually, “Want half my banana?” like it’s nothing.

And Charli takes these offerings the way a starving person takes bread: politely, carefully, trying not to be greedy.

She still apologises too much. Still asks permission for space that’s already been given.

But she’s laughing more. Not big laughs. Little ones. The kind that escape before you can stop them.

One afternoon, we’re fitting a gown on one of the actresses—tall girl, strong shoulders, the kind who fills a room without making noise. She’s wriggling into the bodice and swearing under her breath, and Charli is behind her with the pins, calm as a nurse.

The actress catches her eye in the mirror and says, “You’re the one Sarah called ‘our girl’, yeah?”

Charli freezes. Just for a second.

I did call her that. Without thinking. *Our girl.* Like it was obvious. Like it was fact.

I watch Charli’s reflection. Her mouth parts, that old instinct rising—the correction, the apology, the retreat.

Then she looks at the actress’s face, at Lucy’s steady hands, at Tahlia’s grin, at me leaning on the doorframe with my feral British attitude.

And she lets the moment pass.

“Yeah,” she says. Soft. “I’m… I’m her.”

The actress smiles, bright and uncomplicated. “Good. Can you tell Mara her underarm seam hates me?”

Charli snorts—an actual snort—and the room warms with it.

After, when the actress leaves, Charli lingers by the kettle while I make tea. The building is quieter. Celeste and Lauren are upstairs in some meeting about schedules, budgets, the big external stuff. The kind of stuff that makes you forget the small internal revolutions happening on the floor.

Charli stands with her hands clasped, as if she’s waiting to be dismissed.

“You can sit,” I tell her. “You’re not on trial.”

She perches on the edge of a stool anyway, as if comfort might be confiscated if she relaxes too much.

I pour tea, push a mug toward her. She wraps her hands around it like it’s heat in liquid form.

“Sarah?” she says.

“Mmm?”

“I… I like it,” she says, barely audible. Then she looks down at the mug, as if embarrassed by wanting something. “When you… when you call me that.”

It takes me a second to realise what “that” is, because she won’t name it. She never names things directly if she can help it.

“She,” I say, plain. “You mean.”

Charli’s throat moves. She nods once.

I make a noncommittal noise, like I’m considering the weather, because if I treat it like sacred, she’ll flinch. If I treat it like nothing, she can breathe.

“Course you do,” I say. “It’s nicer than being shoved into ‘mate’ and ‘champ’ by every bloke with a mouth.”

Her smile is tiny, but real. Then she goes serious again.

“I didn’t… I didn’t want to make it weird,” she says.

“Oh, love,” I reply, and I keep my voice light because if I let it go too soft I’ll feel it in my teeth. “The weird bit was us dancing around it like we were carrying a tray of champagne. We should’ve stopped tiptoeing ages ago.”

Charli’s eyes lift to mine. There’s something in them—hope, and fear, and the exhaustion of living as a question mark.

“It feels,” she says slowly, searching for words that won’t get her punished, “like… I’m not outside.”

That hits, and I hate that it hits, because she shouldn’t have had to earn “inside” by being gentle enough to tolerate.

But I don’t do speeches. I do what Wardrobe does: I make it *real* by making it ordinary.

“Well,” I say, taking a sip of tea, “you’re not. And if anyone tries to put you back out, they’ll have to go through me. Which is, frankly, a terrible life choice.”

A laugh escapes her. She covers it with her hand like she’s embarrassed to be happy.

Over the next days the language spreads the way nicknames spread. Not as a demand. As a habit.

The Faire girls adopt it quickest, because theatre women understand roles and respect them. They also understand what it means to choose someone into your circle, and they don’t need a committee meeting to do it.

“She’s the one who saved the sleeve.”
“Ask her—she’ll know.”
“Give it to her, she’s careful.”

It becomes a kind of membership badge: *she* means “safe with us,” “one of us,” “ours.”

And Charli responds to that “ours” the way a person responds to oxygen after holding their breath too long.

She starts joining us for lunch without hovering at the edges. Starts listening less like she’s studying us and more like she belongs in the conversation. Starts offering opinions—small ones at first.

When Lucy complains about men’s pockets being everywhere while women’s clothing is expected to pretend you don’t need to carry objects, Charli says, quietly, “I never understood why it’s… allowed.”

Allowed.

The word is so telling it nearly makes me choke on my tea. As if she’s lived her whole life waiting for permission to exist in a body that doesn’t apologise.

Tahlia nudges her. “That’s because you’re not a bloke,” she says, breezy. Not cruel. Not teasing. Like it’s obvious.

Charli’s cheeks go pink again. She looks down. But she doesn’t fight it.

Not anymore.

And then, because bodies always pick the worst time to be bodies, the late puberty thing starts nipping at the edges.

It’s small at first—voice cracking when she’s tired, a heaviness in her jaw she can feel in the mirror even if no one else can see it yet, a sudden coarseness in her skin that makes her flinch when she touches her own cheek.

She begins watching herself the way you watch a seam you know is under strain. Testing it. Fearing the tear.

I catch her once, staring at a photo on someone’s phone—one of the Faire girls, laughing, hair blown loose, all shoulders and confidence. Charli’s expression is hungry in the gentlest possible way, like she’s looking at a life she’s been allowed to visit but not keep.

Later, I hear her in the bathroom, running the tap too long. That old trick: drowning your own thoughts in water noise.

When she comes back, she’s smiling too brightly. Doing that thing she does—trying to be agreeable enough that no one examines her too closely.

But I see her hands shaking, just slightly, when she reaches for pins.

And that’s when I understand the danger.

Not danger from us. We’re steady. We’re the safe part.

The danger is *her fear of losing the belonging* she’s finally found.

Because in Charli’s mind, I think this friendship is conditional. Conditional on softness. On not becoming “blokey.” On not changing in ways she can’t control.

And if she believes that—if she believes she could be pushed back outside—then of course she would start trying to manage it.

Of course she would.

Not because anyone asked her to. Not because Celeste or Lauren told her what to do. They’re busy upstairs with the big scaffolding of the operation. They haven’t even noticed the language shift taking root below them, like a new vine choosing the wall.

Charli is doing it because she’s terrified of waking up one morning and hearing “he” again—hearing the door close.

So she begins, quietly, privately, to “take the edge off.”

No one says the word “anti-androgen” out loud in the room. Not yet. Not to me. Not to anyone.

But I recognise the shape of secrecy. The way someone guards their bag. The way they avoid eating something in front of you. The way they disappear for ten minutes and return with their mouth rinsed and their eyes a bit too bright.

I don’t confront her. Not immediately. Because I’m not stupid.

If I corner her, she’ll retreat into shame, and shame is where bad decisions thrive.

Instead, I do what women do when we’re protecting someone: I close ranks softly. I keep her close. I make “ours” feel unconditional.

I let the pronouns do their quiet work. I let the friendships deepen. I let the room keep speaking the truth of her.

Because if she’s going to make risky choices out of fear, the first thing she needs is to stop feeling afraid she can be unchosen.

And here—downstairs, where the steam rises and the fabric whispers and the girls pass each other hair ties like vows—

She is chosen.

Whether Celeste and Lauren have clocked it yet or not.

[26-01-21]

**Scene 28 — “Society Has Decided” (Celeste POV)**

*(Three months later)*

Three months changes a room.

Not the bones of it—Mara’s worktables still bore the same scars, the same old pinpricks and iron-sheen and chalk ghosts that never quite wash out. But the *rhythm* had shifted. There was less scrambling. Fewer panicked rearrangements. More quiet, confident repetition—tools being reached for without looking, hands moving as if the day had already been rehearsed.

Wardrobe had become what I’d always wanted it to be:

A place where women did difficult things without drama.

The morning steam rose in slow sheets from the irons. Someone had left a spool of linen thread on the windowsill to warm. A kettle clicked, then settled into a soft hiss. And under all of it was the sound I’d come to associate with safety: the snick of Mara’s scissors, unhurried and certain.

Charli arrived early—again—and this time I didn’t think *why does she do that?* I simply let it be what it was: her ritual. Her way of entering the day gently, before the day could look at her too hard.

She moved through the room with the ease of someone who knew the rules without having to recite them.

Bag on the hook. Hands washed thoroughly. Apron on. Hair pinned back.

She was at the long table when I came in, smoothing a length of white linen as if she was calming an animal. She lifted her head when I approached and gave me a smile that didn’t try to vanish immediately.

That was new.

Not big. Not theatrical.

Just… there.

Something in my chest loosened, the way it does when a person you care about begins to look less like they’re bracing for impact and more like they’re living.

“You’re early,” I said, as if it was a complaint.

“I like the quiet,” she replied.

Her voice had steadied over the months. Still soft, still careful—but with less apology in it.

Lucy was already at the cutting table, coffee in hand, unimpressed with the universe. Tahlia was humming without meaning to, pulling tape measures into line. Sarah was perched on her usual stool like she’d been born there, boot heel hooked on the rung, expression set to *I am merely observing your civilisation, you little ferals.*

The Faire girls had been drifting through more and more often. Not just for fittings and repairs, but because Wardrobe had become a gravitational point—a women’s room, in the truest sense: the kind where you could be tired, sharp, messy, brilliant, and not have to explain any of it.

That drift had changed Charli too.

It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a montage.

It was simply the accumulation of being treated as safe and wanted.

Her laugh came easier now. She didn’t hover on the edges during lunch anymore. She’d started joining in the conversations—small remarks at first, then a dry little observation that made Lucy bark out something almost like amusement. She’d begun to look at the other women without that constant flinch of anticipation.

And this morning—this morning—she looked *happy*.

Mara appeared behind me without fanfare. She didn’t greet anyone. She simply put a garment bundle on the table with the quiet brutality of a fact being placed in evidence.

“Shift,” she said.

Charli’s hands stilled.

“Mine?” she asked, as if she wasn’t sure she’d earned the right to claim it.

Mara’s expression didn’t change. “Designed by you. Sewn by you. Corrected by you. Washed three times. Pressed. If it fails, we learn.”

Charli exhaled, the way someone exhales when they’re handed responsibility instead of kindness.

“Right,” she murmured. “Right.”

She unwrapped it carefully. White linen, fine but strong. Period-correct in cut and gusset placement. Underarm shaping that actually respected movement instead of pretending bodies didn’t have shoulders.

The work was… good.

Not perfect. Not yet.

But good in a way that made my throat tighten unexpectedly. It wasn’t just the garment. It was the quiet fact that Charli had begun to build something—*make something*—instead of merely surviving.

Mara made a small gesture toward the stays hanging nearby—the latest iteration, the one we’d been refining for weeks.

“Put them on,” she said. “Over the shift.”

Charli’s cheeks flushed, reflexive.

Tahlia was already turning away—deliberately casual, giving her privacy without making it a performance. Lucy didn’t look up at all, which was Lucy’s way of saying, *I don’t sexualise you. I’m here for the seams.*

Sarah, though—Sarah’s eyes flicked over with that sharp British amusement.

“Oh, go on then,” she said. “Try on your armour, love.”

Charli shot her a look that was half mortified and half… fond. That, too, was new.

She stepped behind the screen. The room didn’t pause; it simply adjusted around her, as if this was normal. Because it was.

I heard the soft rustle of linen. The tiny tug and shift of fabric settling against skin. Then the measured movements of someone lacing stays with care rather than panic.

When she stepped out again, it was like seeing the argument come together.

The shift sat correctly at her shoulders. The neckline was modest, period-true. The sleeves ended at the right point, linen cuff whispering against her wrists. And the stays—

The stays held.

Not brutally. Not theatrically.

They held the way good engineering holds: firm in the right places, forgiving in the right places, allowing movement rather than forbidding it.

Charli stood very still for a moment, as if she was waiting for the world to contradict what she felt.

“Walk,” Mara ordered.

Charli walked.

She didn’t mince. She didn’t swagger. She simply moved—small, careful steps at first, then with growing confidence as her body realised it was permitted to exist inside this structure without being punished.

“Raise your arms,” Mara said.

Charli did, slowly.

The underarm gussets behaved. The stays flexed the way they were meant to. No tugging, no glaring strain lines.

“Turn,” Mara said.

Charli turned.

And that was when I saw it again.

That subtle fullness in her chest.

The first time I’d noticed it—three months ago, on her first day—it had been a flicker of curiosity. A question I didn’t ask aloud. A softness beneath her shirt that didn’t quite fit the story the world would have told about a boy arriving for work.

Then again when she moved in with me. In the morning, in the half-light, when she’d pulled on a t-shirt and I’d caught the shape for a second and filed it away like a strange line in a ledger.

Now, under a shift and stays designed to *reveal structure*, it was unmistakable.

Not exaggerated. Not obscene. Not a spectacle.

Just… present.

The kind of body truth you can’t unsee once you see it.

My mind did what it always did: it reached for explanations. Stress. Weight fluctuation. Posture. The way stays redistribute silhouette. The way linen catches light. The way my own expectations might be colouring perception.

And then another part of me—the part that understood Wardrobe’s quiet rules—said:

Stop trying to argue the body out of what it is.

Charli stood there, cheeks pink, hands at her sides like she wasn’t sure what to do with them. And I saw, suddenly, not just a “boy learning women’s work,” but a person whose body had been quietly, steadily contradicting the world’s categories long before we ever named anything.

Tahlia circled her, professional. “Looks better,” she said.

Lucy pointed with her coffee. “Shoulder line’s good. No bunching.”

Sarah tilted her head, considering Charli like she was a painting that had finally come into focus.

Then—because Sarah is Sarah—she said it.

“Honestly,” she remarked, loud enough for the room, “it’s a bit unfair how well Celeste’s wife is turning out.”

Charli froze.

The room didn’t.

Lucy let out a short sound—half laugh, half scoff. “Wife,” she repeated, as if tasting it. “Yeah, okay. That tracks.”

Tahlia grinned. “It does, though.”

One of the Faire girls—Bree, tall and bright-eyed—walked in mid-sentence and immediately clocked the tableau: Charli in shift and stays, the women circling, Mara’s expression like a judge in a courtroom of cloth.

Bree’s face lit. “Oh my God,” she said, delighted. “She looks *correct*.”

I felt something inside me stop.

She.

Bree hadn’t hesitated. She hadn’t checked. She hadn’t looked to me for permission.

She had simply… said it.

As if it was obvious.

As if it had been obvious for weeks.

Lucy didn’t flinch. Tahlia didn’t flinch. Sarah’s mouth quirked—satisfied, almost smug, like she’d just nudged a domino and watched it fall exactly as expected.

Charli’s eyes widened. Her breath caught.

And then—crucially—she didn’t correct anyone.

Not a twitch of protest. Not a nervous laugh. Not a frantic, “I’m not—”

She just stood there, chest rising and falling, as if she was listening to the word land inside her body and deciding it didn’t hurt.

Bree stepped closer, hands hovering near the stays without touching. “Can she lift her arms again?” she asked, already speaking like Charli was a collaborative object in the room rather than an anomaly.

“She can,” Mara said.

Charli lifted her arms.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “She’s going to be a menace. I love her.”

Charli’s face went incandescent. But under the embarrassment was something else.

A glow. A quiet basking.

The kind you see when someone has been chosen into a circle they never thought would open for them.

Sarah leaned back on her stool, satisfied. “Right,” she said, as if concluding a minor administrative matter. “We can stop tiptoeing now.”

There it was again—Sarah’s line—this time not as provocation but as relief. A declaration that the awkwardness was over, not because we’d argued it into submission, but because the room had decided not to treat Charli like a fragile question anymore.

Tahlia reached out and adjusted a lace end with practised fingers. “Looks good, Charli,” she said.

Not Charlie.

Charli.

Sans e.

Just… done.

No announcement. No trumpet. Not even a pause.

Like it had always been waiting.

Charli blinked fast, as if tears were an option she was trying not to allow herself. “It’s—” she started. “It’s fine.”

Lucy snorted. “It’s not fine, it’s better than fine. Don’t insult your own work.”

Charli’s mouth did something—an attempt at a smile that became a real one when she realised nobody was going to punish her for it.

I stood there, watching, trying to keep my face neutral.

Because inside, something complicated was happening.

I had used the word wife—internally, privately, as a way of naming function. The role. The support. The way Charli fit into my life not as romance, not as a fantasy, but as infrastructure.

I had thought it was harmless. A private shorthand.

I hadn’t realised it was also… a seed.

A framing.

A story the room could take up and make real.

And of course it did.

Because women are not stupid about language. We understand what words do. We understand that the right word, used repeatedly in the right room, can make a person stop feeling like they’re trespassing.

I had not planned this.

But I had, unmistakably, contributed to the conditions that made it inevitable.

Bree was still chattering—something about rehearsal tonight, something about whether Charli could come and see the dress run, something about chips afterward. The other Faire girls nodded along, already folding Charli into their social calendar as if she belonged there by law.

Charli’s answer came too quickly. “I can,” she said, eager, and then she checked herself, as if she’d revealed too much want. “If that’s… if that’s okay.”

Tahlia rolled her eyes fondly. “Of course it’s okay. She’s coming.”

She.

Again.

And again Charli didn’t resist.

I found myself looking at her profile—the softened line of her cheek, the quiet fullness at her chest held neatly by stays, the way she stood among women as if she’d finally stopped expecting to be ejected.

Three months ago she’d looked like she was surviving.

Now she looked like she was… blooming.

I felt a sharp little pang of pride, quickly followed by something else: a sober recognition.

This wasn’t a private experiment anymore. It wasn’t even a Wardrobe matter.

It was social now.

The women had decided.

Society—*our* society, the only one that mattered inside these walls—had decided.

And there was no going back from that.

Sarah’s eyes met mine across the room. Her gaze was bright, knowing.

She didn’t say *told you so*—Sarah has better manners than that, in her own feral way.

But her expression said: *Well? Are you going to pretend you didn’t hear it?*

I didn’t pretend.

I let my face soften into something like acceptance. Maybe even approval.

Because what else could I do?

Correct them? Reopen the question? Drag Charli back into uncertainty because I hadn’t personally authorised the outcome?

No.

That would be cruelty dressed up as prudence.

If the room was giving her belonging, the only ethical response was to protect it.

I stepped forward and adjusted a stray lace end at her waist, careful not to make it intimate. Just practical. Just part of the work.

“Looks good,” I said. “You’ve improved the line.”

Charli looked up at me, eyes wide with that old fear—fear of being told she’d imagined too much. Fear of being punished for wanting.

And I gave her what she needed: steadiness.

Not a speech. Not a romance.

Just a fact.

“You’re doing well,” I said.

Her shoulders dropped a fraction, relief moving through her like warmth.

Bree bounced on her toes. “So she’s coming tonight, yeah?”

Charli’s mouth opened—eager, then cautious.

Lucy answered for her, flat and final. “She’s coming.”

Sarah smiled, satisfied.

And Mara, as if bored by the entire human dimension, tapped the table once.

“Enough talking,” she said. “More work.”

The room obeyed, laughing as it did.

And Charli—Charli laughed too.

Not small this time.

Real.

As if the word *she* had stopped being a risk and started being a home.

If you want, the *next* scene can be a short Lauren POV fragment where she first hears “she” in passing and doesn’t react outwardly—just a slow, internal recalibration. That sets up the longer arc you described: Lauren’s true reconciliation arriving later, when she becomes instrumental in getting Charli proper care.

Also: if you’d like the “secret sorrow” thread preserved here (the late-puberty fear), we can add one subtle beat right near the end—Lucy clocking a shadow in Charli’s expression when someone mentions photos, or mirrors, or “getting dolled up,” and Lucy casually handing her a snack or nudging her into the group, like a quiet *we’ve got you*, even if nobody knows what they’re protecting her from yet.

**Scene 28 — “Society Has Decided” (Celeste POV)**

*(Three months later)*

Scene 28
✨ Society Has Decided ✨
[Celeste]

Three months changes a room.

Not the bones of it. Mara’s worktables still bore the same scars, the same old pinpricks and iron: sheen and chalk ghosts that never quite wash out. But the *rhythm* had shifted. There was less scrambling. Fewer panicked rearrangements. More quiet, confident repetition—tools being reached for without looking, hands moving as if the day had been rehearsed.

Wardrobe had become what I’d always wanted it to be: a place where women did difficult things without drama.

The morning steam rose in slow sheets from the irons. Someone had left a spool of linen thread on the windowsill to warm. A kettle clicked, then settled into a soft hiss. And under all of it was the sound I’d come to associate with safety: the snick of Mara’s scissors, unhurried and certain.

Charli arrived early—again—and this time I didn’t think *why does he do that?* I simply let it be what it was: his ritual. His way of entering the day gently, before the day could look at him too hard.

He moved through the room with the ease of someone who knew the rules without having to recite them.

Bag on the hook. Hands washed thoroughly. Apron on. Hair pinned back.

He was at the long table when I came in, smoothing a length of white linen as if he was calming an animal. He lifted his head when I approached and gave me a smile that didn’t try to vanish immediately.

That was new.

Not big or theatrical.

Just... there.

Something in me eased, the way it does when a person you care about begins to look less like they’re bracing for impact and more like they’re living.

“You’re early,” I said, as if it was a complaint.

“I like the quiet.”

His voice had steadied over the months. Soft, but a different sort of soft; careful, but with less apology in it.

Lucy was already at the cutting table, coffee in hand, unimpressed with the universe. Tahlia was humming without meaning to, pulling tape measures into line. Sarah was perched on her usual stool like she’d been born there, boot heel hooked on the rung, expression set to *I am merely observing your civilisation, you little ferals*.

The Faire girls had been drifting through more and more often. Not just for fittings and repairs, but because Wardrobe had become a gravitational point: a women’s room, in the truest sense, the kind where you could be tired, sharp, messy, brilliant, and not have to explain any of it.

That drift had changed Charli too.

The accumulation of being treated as safe and wanted allowed his laugh to come easier now. He didn’t hover on the edges during lunch anymore: he’d started joining in the conversations. Small remarks at first, then a dry little observation that made Lucy bark out something almost like amusement. He had begun to look at the other women without that constant flinch of anticipation.

And this morning—this morning—he looked *happy*.

Mara appeared behind me without fanfare. She didn’t greet anyone. She simply put a garment bundle on the table with the quiet brutality of a fact being placed in evidence.

“Chemise.”

Charli’s hands stilled.

“Mine?”

Mara’s expression didn’t change, simply a short nod. “Designed by you. Sewn by you. Corrected by you. Washed three times. Pressed. If it fails, we learn.”

Charli exhaled, the way someone exhales when they’re handed responsibility instead of kindness.

“Right,” he murmured. “Right.”

He unwrapped it carefully. White linen, fine but strong, period-correct in cut and gusset placement. Underarm shaping that actually respected movement instead of pretending bodies didn’t have shoulders.

The work was... classic Charli. Not perfect, not yet, but good in a way that made my throat tighten unexpectedly. It wasn’t just the garment. It was the quiet fact that Charli had begun to build something—*make something*—instead of merely surviving.

Mara made a small gesture toward the stays hanging nearby: the latest iteration, the one we’d been refining for weeks.

“Put them on,” she said. “Over the chemise.”

Charli’s cheeks flushed briefly, reflexive. Tahlia was already turning back to her work: deliberately casual, giving him privacy without making it a performance. Lucy didn’t look up at all, which was Lucy’s way of saying, *I don’t need to inspect you: I’m here for the seams.*

Sarah, though—Sarah’s eyes flicked over with that sharp British amusement.

“Oh, go on then,” she said. “Try on your armour, love.”

Charli shot her a look that was half abashed and half... fond. That, too, was new. He stepped behind the screen. The room didn’t pause; it simply went on around him. I heard the soft rustle of linen. The tiny tug and shift of fabric settling against skin. 

"Ready to be strapped in?" Sarah called in to him.

"Yes, please."

The measured movements of someone lacing stays with care followed. When they stepped out again, it was like seeing the argument come together.

The chemise sat correctly at his shoulders. The neckline was modest, period-true. The sleeves ended at the right point, linen cuff whispering against his wrists. And the stays—

The stays held.

Not brutally or theatrically. They held the way good engineering holds: firm in the right places, forgiving in the right places, allowing movement rather than forbidding it. Charli stood very still for a moment, as if he was waiting for the world to contradict what he felt.

“Walk,” Mara ordered.

Charli walked: small, careful steps at first, then with growing confidence as his body realised it was permitted to exist inside this structure without being punished.

“Raise your arms,” Mara said.

Charli did, slowly.

The underarm gussets behaved. The stays flexed the way they were meant to. No tugging, no glaring strain lines.

“Turn.”

Charli turned. And that was when I saw it again.

That fullness in the chest.

The first time I’d noticed it—three months ago, on his first day—it had been a flicker of curiosity. A question I didn’t ask aloud. A softness beneath the t-shirt that didn’t quite fit the story the world would have told about a boy arriving for work.

Then, again when he moved in with me. In the morning, in the half-light, when he’d pulled on a t-shirt and I’d caught the shape for a second and filed it away like a strange line in a ledger.

Now, under a chemise and stays designed to *reveal structure*, it was unmistakable. Not exaggerated or a spectacle. Just... undeniably there. A swelling. The kind of body truth you can’t unsee once you see it.

My mind did what it always did: it reached for explanations. Stress. Weight fluctuation. Posture. The way stays redistribute silhouette. The way linen catches light. The way my own expectations might be colouring perception.

And then another part of me, the part that understood Wardrobe’s quiet rules, said: *stop trying to argue the body out of what it is*.

Charli stood there, cheeks pink, hands at his sides like he wasn’t sure what to do with them. And I saw, suddenly, not just a “boy learning women’s work,” but a person whose body had been quietly, steadily contradicting the world’s categories long before we ever named anything.

Tahlia circled him, professional, not looking at him but at the clothing.

“Looks better.”

Lucy pointed with her coffee. “Shoulder line’s good. No bunching.”

Sarah tilted her head, considering Charli like she was a painting that had finally come into focus.

Then, because Sarah is Sarah, she said it.

“Honestly,” she remarked, loud enough for the room, “it’s a bit unfair how well Celeste’s wife is turning out.”

Charli looked at Sarah with furrowed brow, puzzled.

The room, however, wasn’t puzzled. Quite the opposite.

Lucy let out a short half laugh

“Wife,” she repeated, as if tasting it. “Yeah, okay. That tracks.”

Tahlia grinned. “It does, too, doesn't it?”

One of the Faire girls, Bree, tall and bright-eyed, walked in mid-sentence and immediately clocked the tableau: Charli in chemise and stays, the women circling, Mara’s expression like a judge in a courtroom of cloth.

Bree’s face lit. “Oh my God,” she said, delighted. “She looks like a *proper actress*.”

I felt something inside me stop.

She.

Bree hadn’t hesitated. She hadn’t checked. She hadn’t looked to me for permission.

She had simply... said this *word*. Like, it was just already there, had been there for ages, as if it was obvious, as if it had been obvious for months.

And then I noticed: Lucy didn’t flinch. Tahlia didn’t flinch. Sarah’s mouth quirked—satisfied, almost smug, like she’d just nudged a domino and watched it fall exactly as expected.

And Charli—Charli didn’t correct anyone. Not a twitch of protest. Not a nervous laugh. Not a frantic, “I’m not—”

**She** just stood there with a soft smile for Bree, chest rising and falling, as if she was listening to the word land inside her body and was content that it didn’t hurt. Bree stepped closer, hands hovering near the stays without touching.

“Can she lift her arms again?” she asked, speaking like Charli was a collaborator.

“She can,” Mara said.

Charli lifted her arms.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “She’s going to be a menace. I love her.”

Charli’s face was incandescent. A glow. A quiet basking. The kind you see when someone has been chosen into a circle they never thought would open for them.

Sarah was looking at my face with a knowing smile. She leaned back on her stool with a satisfied sigh.

“Right,” she said, as if concluding a minor administrative matter. “We can stop tiptoeing now.”

There it was: a declaration that the awkwardness was over, because now, I knew what they'd known for a long time. Tahlia reached out and adjusted a lace end with practised fingers. 

“Looks good, Charli.”

Charli glanced at me and blinked fast, as if tears were an option she was trying not to allow herself.

“It’s—” she started. “It’s fine.”

Lucy snorted. “It’s not fine, it’s better than fine. Don’t insult your own work.”

Charli’s mouth did something new—a smile, a real, a *radiant* one. I stood there, watching, trying to keep my face neutral, because inside, something complicated was happening.

I had been using the word 'wife' internally, privately: as a way of naming function. The role. The support. The way Charli fit into my life not as romance, not as a fantasy, but as infrastructure.

I had thought it was precise. Accurate. The only possible term for it. But, a *private* shorthand.

I hadn’t realised it was also... a seed.

A framing.

A story the room could detect, acknowledge, take up and make real. Which, of *course* it did. Because women are not stupid about language. We understand what words do. We understand that the right word, used repeatedly in the right room, can make a person stop feeling like they’re trespassing.

I could not have forseen this. I certainly had not *planned* this. But I had, unmistakably, contributed to the conditions that made it inevitable.

Bree was still chattering: something about rehearsal tonight, something about whether Charli could come and see the dress run, something about chips afterward. The other Faire girls nodded along, already folding Charli into their social calendar as if she belonged there by law.

Charli’s answer came too quickly. “Sure, I can do,” she said, eager, and then she checked herself, as if she’d revealed too much want. “If that’s... if that’s okay.”

Tahlia rolled her eyes fondly. “Of course it’s okay. You’re coming, girlfriend.”

"Absolutely, she is!" Lucy agreed.

*She*.

*Again*.

And again Charli, flowing with it. Soft smile, shy, natural, surrounded by friends. I found myself looking at her profile: the softened line of her cheek, the quiet fullness at her chest held neatly by stays, the way she stood among her women friends as if she’d finally stopped expecting to be ejected.

Three months ago she’d looked like she was on the outside looking in. Now she was... blooming.

I felt a sharp little pang of pride, quickly followed by something else: a sober recognition. This wasn’t a private experiment anymore. It wasn’t even a Wardrobe matter. It was social.

The women had decided.

Society—*our* society, the only one that mattered inside these walls—had decided.

And there was no going back from that.

Sarah’s eyes met mine across the room. Her gaze was bright, knowing. She didn’t say *told you so*—Sarah has better manners than that, in her own feral way—but her expression said as clearly as if she was shouting through a megaphone:

*Well? Are you going to pretend you didn’t hear it?*

I pursed my lip and gave her a wry smile. I didn’t intend to pretend. I let my face soften into something like acceptance. Maybe even approval.

What else could I do? Correct them? Reopen the question? Drag Charli back into uncertainty because I hadn’t personally supervised and authorised an outcome I'd actually had a large part in founding?

No.

That would be cruelty dressed up as prudence.

If the room was giving her *belonging*, the only ethical response was to protect that belonging. I stepped forward and adjusted a stray lace end at her waist, careful not to make it intimate, just practical. Just part of the work.

“Looks good,” I said to softly with what I hoped was a reassuring smile. “You’ve improved the line.”

Charli looked up at me, eyes wide and swallowing hard. That old fear—fear of being punished for wanting. And so I gave her what she needed: steadiness. Just... a fact.

“You’re doing well.”

Her shoulders dropped a fraction. Relief seemed to flow through her like warmth.

Bree bounced on her toes. “So she’s coming tonight, yeah?”

Charli’s mouth opened—eager, then cautious.

Lucy answered for her, flat and final. “Of *course* she’s coming.”

Sarah smiled, satisfied.

And Mara, as if bored by the entire human dimension, tapped the table once.

“Enough talking,” she said. “More work.”

The room obeyed, laughing as it did.

And Charli—Charli laughed too. Not small this time: a real laugh. A first, for her. And for me.

It was as if the word *she* had stopped being a risk and started being a home.
