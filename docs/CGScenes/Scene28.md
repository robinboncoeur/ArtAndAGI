**Scene 28 — “Society Has Decided” (Celeste POV)**

*(Three months later)*

Scene 28
✨ Society Has Decided ✨
[Celeste]

Three months changes a room.

Not the bones of it. Mara’s worktables still bore the same scars, the same old pinpricks and iron: sheen and chalk ghosts that never quite wash out. But the *rhythm* had shifted. There was less scrambling. Fewer panicked rearrangements. More quiet, confident repetition—tools being reached for without looking, hands moving as if the day had been rehearsed.

Wardrobe had become what I’d always wanted it to be: a place where women did difficult things without drama.

The morning steam rose in slow sheets from the irons. Someone had left a spool of linen thread on the windowsill to warm. A kettle clicked, then settled into a soft hiss. And under all of it was the sound I’d come to associate with safety: the snick of Mara’s scissors, unhurried and certain.

Charli arrived early—again—and this time I didn’t think *why does he do that?* I simply let it be what it was: his ritual. His way of entering the day gently, before the day could look at him too hard.

He moved through the room with the ease of someone who knew the rules without having to recite them.

Bag on the hook. Hands washed thoroughly. Apron on. Hair pinned back.

He was at the long table when I came in, smoothing a length of white linen as if he was calming an animal. He lifted his head when I approached and gave me a smile that didn’t try to vanish immediately.

That was new.

Not big or theatrical.

Just... there.

Something in me eased, the way it does when a person you care about begins to look less like they’re bracing for impact and more like they’re living.

“You’re early,” I said, as if it was a complaint.

“I like the quiet.”

His voice had steadied over the months. Soft, but a different sort of soft; careful, but with less apology in it.

Lucy was already at the cutting table, coffee in hand, unimpressed with the universe. Tahlia was humming without meaning to, pulling tape measures into line. Sarah was perched on her usual stool like she’d been born there, boot heel hooked on the rung, expression set to *I am merely observing your civilisation, you little ferals*.

The Faire girls had been drifting through more and more often. Not just for fittings and repairs, but because Wardrobe had become a gravitational point: a women’s room, in the truest sense, the kind where you could be tired, sharp, messy, brilliant, and not have to explain any of it.

That drift had changed Charli too.

The accumulation of being treated as safe and wanted allowed his laugh to come easier now. He didn’t hover on the edges during lunch anymore: he’d started joining in the conversations. Small remarks at first, then a dry little observation that made Lucy bark out something almost like amusement. He had begun to look at the other women without that constant flinch of anticipation.

And this morning—this morning—he looked *happy*.

Mara appeared behind me without fanfare. She didn’t greet anyone. She simply put a garment bundle on the table with the quiet brutality of a fact being placed in evidence.

“Chemise.”

Charli’s hands stilled.

“Mine?”

Mara’s expression didn’t change, simply a short nod. “Designed by you. Sewn by you. Corrected by you. Washed three times. Pressed. If it fails, we learn.”

Charli exhaled, the way someone exhales when they’re handed responsibility instead of kindness.

“Right,” he murmured. “Right.”

He unwrapped it carefully. White linen, fine but strong, period-correct in cut and gusset placement. Underarm shaping that actually respected movement instead of pretending bodies didn’t have shoulders.

The work was... classic Charli. Not perfect, not yet, but good in a way that made my throat tighten unexpectedly. It wasn’t just the garment. It was the quiet fact that Charli had begun to build something—*make something*—instead of merely surviving.

Mara made a small gesture toward the stays hanging nearby: the latest iteration, the one we’d been refining for weeks.

“Put them on,” she said. “Over the chemise.”

Charli’s cheeks flushed briefly, reflexive. Tahlia was already turning back to her work: deliberately casual, giving him privacy without making it a performance. Lucy didn’t look up at all, which was Lucy’s way of saying, *I don’t need to inspect you: I’m here for the seams.*

Sarah, though—Sarah’s eyes flicked over with that sharp British amusement.

“Oh, go on then,” she said. “Try on your armour, love.”

Charli shot her a look that was half abashed and half... fond. That, too, was new. He stepped behind the screen. The room didn’t pause; it simply went on around him. I heard the soft rustle of linen. The tiny tug and shift of fabric settling against skin. 

"Ready to be strapped in?" Sarah called in to him.

"Yes, please."

The measured movements of someone lacing stays with care followed. When they stepped out again, it was like seeing the argument come together.

The chemise sat correctly at his shoulders. The neckline was modest, period-true. The sleeves ended at the right point, linen cuff whispering against his wrists. And the stays—

The stays held.

Not brutally or theatrically. They held the way good engineering holds: firm in the right places, forgiving in the right places, allowing movement rather than forbidding it. Charli stood very still for a moment, as if he was waiting for the world to contradict what he felt.

“Walk,” Mara ordered.

Charli walked: small, careful steps at first, then with growing confidence as his body realised it was permitted to exist inside this structure without being punished.

“Raise your arms,” Mara said.

Charli did, slowly.

The underarm gussets behaved. The stays flexed the way they were meant to. No tugging, no glaring strain lines.

“Turn.”

Charli turned. And that was when I saw it again.

That fullness in the chest.

The first time I’d noticed it—three months ago, on his first day—it had been a flicker of curiosity. A question I didn’t ask aloud. A softness beneath the t-shirt that didn’t quite fit the story the world would have told about a boy arriving for work.

Then, again when he moved in with me. In the morning, in the half-light, when he’d pulled on a t-shirt and I’d caught the shape for a second and filed it away like a strange line in a ledger.

Now, under a chemise and stays designed to *reveal structure*, it was unmistakable. Not exaggerated or a spectacle. Just... undeniably there. A swelling. The kind of body truth you can’t unsee once you see it.

My mind did what it always did: it reached for explanations. Stress. Weight fluctuation. Posture. The way stays redistribute silhouette. The way linen catches light. The way my own expectations might be colouring perception.

And then another part of me, the part that understood Wardrobe’s quiet rules, said: *stop trying to argue the body out of what it is*.

Charli stood there, cheeks pink, hands at his sides like he wasn’t sure what to do with them. And I saw, suddenly, not just a “boy learning women’s work,” but a person whose body had been quietly, steadily contradicting the world’s categories long before we ever named anything.

Tahlia circled him, professional, not looking at him but at the clothing.

“Looks better.”

Lucy pointed with her coffee. “Shoulder line’s good. No bunching.”

Sarah tilted her head, considering Charli like she was a painting that had finally come into focus.

Then, because Sarah is Sarah, she said it.

“Honestly,” she remarked, loud enough for the room, “it’s a bit unfair how well Celeste’s wife is turning out.”

Charli looked at Sarah with furrowed brow, puzzled.

The room, however, wasn’t puzzled. Quite the opposite.

Lucy let out a short half laugh

“Wife,” she repeated, as if tasting it. “Yeah, okay. That tracks.”

Tahlia grinned. “It does, too, doesn't it?”

One of the Faire girls, Bree, tall and bright-eyed, walked in mid-sentence and immediately clocked the tableau: Charli in chemise and stays, the women circling, Mara’s expression like a judge in a courtroom of cloth.

Bree’s face lit. “Oh my God,” she said, delighted. “She looks like a *proper actress*.”

I felt something inside me stop.

She.

Bree hadn’t hesitated. She hadn’t checked. She hadn’t looked to me for permission.

She had simply... said this *word*. Like, it was just already there, had been there for ages, as if it was obvious, as if it had been obvious for months.

And then I noticed: Lucy didn’t flinch. Tahlia didn’t flinch. Sarah’s mouth quirked—satisfied, almost smug, like she’d just nudged a domino and watched it fall exactly as expected.

And Charli—Charli didn’t correct anyone. Not a twitch of protest. Not a nervous laugh. Not a frantic, “I’m not—”

**She** just stood there with a soft smile for Bree, chest rising and falling, as if she was listening to the word land inside her body and was content that it didn’t hurt. Bree stepped closer, hands hovering near the stays without touching.

“Can she lift her arms again?” she asked, speaking like Charli was a collaborator.

“She can,” Mara said.

Charli lifted her arms.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “She’s going to be a menace. I love her.”

Charli’s face was incandescent. A glow. A quiet basking. The kind you see when someone has been chosen into a circle they never thought would open for them.

Sarah was looking at my face with a knowing smile. She leaned back on her stool with a satisfied sigh.

“Right,” she said, as if concluding a minor administrative matter. “We can stop tiptoeing now.”

There it was: a declaration that the awkwardness was over, because now, I knew what they'd known for a long time. Tahlia reached out and adjusted a lace end with practised fingers. 

“Looks good, Charli.”

Charli glanced at me and blinked fast, as if tears were an option she was trying not to allow herself.

“It’s—” she started. “It’s fine.”

Lucy snorted. “It’s not fine, it’s better than fine. Don’t insult your own work.”

Charli’s mouth did something new—a smile, a real, a *radiant* one. I stood there, watching, trying to keep my face neutral, because inside, something complicated was happening.

I had been using the word 'wife' internally, privately: as a way of naming function. The role. The support. The way Charli fit into my life not as romance, not as a fantasy, but as infrastructure.

I had thought it was precise. Accurate. The only possible term for it. But, a *private* shorthand.

I hadn’t realised it was also... a seed.

A framing.

A story the room could detect, acknowledge, take up and make real. Which, of *course* it did. Because women are not stupid about language. We understand what words do. We understand that the right word, used repeatedly in the right room, can make a person stop feeling like they’re trespassing.

I could not have forseen this. I certainly had not *planned* this. But I had, unmistakably, contributed to the conditions that made it inevitable.

Bree was still chattering: something about rehearsal tonight, something about whether Charli could come and see the dress run, something about chips afterward. The other Faire girls nodded along, already folding Charli into their social calendar as if she belonged there by law.

Charli’s answer came too quickly. “Sure, I can do,” she said, eager, and then she checked herself, as if she’d revealed too much want. “If that’s... if that’s okay.”

Tahlia rolled her eyes fondly. “Of course it’s okay. You’re coming, girlfriend.”

"Absolutely, she is!" Lucy agreed.

*She*.

*Again*.

And again Charli, flowing with it. Soft smile, shy, natural, surrounded by friends. I found myself looking at her profile: the softened line of her cheek, the quiet fullness at her chest held neatly by stays, the way she stood among her women friends as if she’d finally stopped expecting to be ejected.

Three months ago she’d looked like she was on the outside looking in. Now she was... blooming.

I felt a sharp little pang of pride, quickly followed by something else: a sober recognition. This wasn’t a private experiment anymore. It wasn’t even a Wardrobe matter. It was social.

The women had decided.

Society—*our* society, the only one that mattered inside these walls—had decided.

And there was no going back from that.

Sarah’s eyes met mine across the room. Her gaze was bright, knowing. She didn’t say *told you so*—Sarah has better manners than that, in her own feral way—but her expression said as clearly as if she was shouting through a megaphone:

*Well? Are you going to pretend you didn’t hear it?*

I pursed my lip and gave her a wry smile. I didn’t intend to pretend. I let my face soften into something like acceptance. Maybe even approval.

What else could I do? Correct them? Reopen the question? Drag Charli back into uncertainty because I hadn’t personally supervised and authorised an outcome I'd actually had a large part in founding?

No.

That would be cruelty dressed up as prudence.

If the room was giving her *belonging*, the only ethical response was to protect that belonging. I stepped forward and adjusted a stray lace end at her waist, careful not to make it intimate, just practical. Just part of the work.

“Looks good,” I said to softly with what I hoped was a reassuring smile. “You’ve improved the line.”

Charli looked up at me, eyes wide and swallowing hard. That old fear—fear of being punished for wanting. And so I gave her what she needed: steadiness. Just... a fact.

“You’re doing well.”

Her shoulders dropped a fraction. Relief seemed to flow through her like warmth.

Bree bounced on her toes. “So she’s coming tonight, yeah?”

Charli’s mouth opened—eager, then cautious.

Lucy answered for her, flat and final. “Of *course* she’s coming.”

Sarah smiled, satisfied.

And Mara, as if bored by the entire human dimension, tapped the table once.

“Enough talking,” she said. “More work.”

The room obeyed, laughing as it did.

And Charli—Charli laughed too. Not small this time: a real laugh. A first, for her. And for me.

It was as if the word *she* had stopped being a risk and started being a home.
