**Scene 44 — “Not a Blanket” (Sarah POV)**

I told myself I was going out for a drink because I deserved one.

Because I’d done the adult thing with Carl. Because I’d been honest. Because I hadn’t caved to guilt or panic or habit.

All true.

Also, because I’d just opened the back of my own mental closet and found a teenage crush still sitting there, perfectly preserved, like ski gear with the tags still on.

I didn’t want to think about it.

So I chose the oldest strategy in the book: blunt the edges.

I went out alone, which is something I almost never do now, because I am not a romantic and I am not daft.

But I wasn’t looking for romance.

I was looking for noise. For anonymity. For the comforting blur of strangers who didn’t know my history or my rules.

I picked a bar that wasn’t *my* bar.

A place with warm lighting and too much bass and stools that stuck to the backs of your thighs when you stood up. A place where people came to forget themselves in public, together.

I ordered a drink and watched the bartender make it. I’m not stupid.

I took it to a table near the wall, back against something solid, because old habits are not the enemy—they’re a form of intelligence.

For the first half hour, it worked.

The drink eased the tightness in my chest. The noise kept my brain from spiralling. I scrolled my phone and pretended I was just waiting for a friend.

No one bothered me.

I should have left then.

I didn’t.

Because when you’ve spent your whole life being competent, it feels obscene to admit that you’re rattled by a memory from Year Ten. It feels weak to say: *I think I might want something different from my life.*

So I ordered another.

Still watching. Still careful. Still “fine.”

I told myself I’d go after that one. I even stood up once, like I meant it.

Then someone bumped into my table and apologised, and I sat back down because the apology made the world feel briefly civil again.

Another drink.

I was still coherent. Still upright. Still me.

And then… it happened.

Not dramatically. Not like the movies.

Just a wrongness—sudden and unmistakable—like my body had stepped on a stair that wasn’t there.

My stomach rolled. The room tilted, not pleasantly. My skin went hot and then cold, as if someone was adjusting my temperature with a remote. My tongue felt thick. My hands stopped feeling like mine.

I blinked hard. Once. Twice.

*No,* my brain said, sharp and furious. *No, no, no.*

I looked down at my glass.

Half-full. Nothing obvious. Nothing to point to and say *that*.

I tried to stand and my legs said, *absolutely not.*

Panic rose in me—fast, animal.

Not shame.

Not sadness.

Pure survival.

I grabbed my phone and fumbled it once, twice, before it unlocked.

The screen swam.

I could have called the police.

I could have called Bree.

I could have called… anyone.

But the only thought that mattered was this:

*Call the woman who does not ask questions first.*

Lauren.

My thumb hit her name. The phone went to my ear. The ringing sounded far away.

Then her voice, immediate, clear.

“Sarah?”

Something in my chest cracked with relief so sharp it almost hurt.

“Lauren,” I managed. My voice sounded wrong to my own ears—too careful, too slow. “I—I’m not right.”

Lauren didn’t panic. She didn’t do the “what did you do?” tone.

“Where are you?” she asked, calm as a seatbelt.

I forced the address out. I had to look at the menu board behind the bar to read the street name because my brain couldn’t hold it.

“Okay,” Lauren said. “Listen to me. Are you with anyone?”

“No.”

“Can you get outside?”

I glanced toward the door. It looked miles away.

“I—I think so.”

“Good,” she said. “Stand up slowly. Don’t finish your drink. Take your phone and your bag. Go straight out the front. Sit where you can be seen. I’m coming.”

“Okay,” I whispered.

“Sarah,” Lauren said, and her voice sharpened just enough to cut through the fog, “you’re doing brilliantly. Keep breathing. I’ll be there in minutes.”

Minutes.

It sounded like a lifetime.

I stood up carefully, one hand gripping the table until my knuckles went white. The room swayed. I waited until it settled.

I left the glass exactly where it was, because something in me—some last shred of angry competence—wanted it left behind like evidence, even if I didn’t know what I’d prove.

I moved toward the door.

Someone brushed past me and I flinched so hard my heart stuttered. I kept going anyway, because I am not prey and I am not staying.

The night air hit my face like a slap.

It should have helped.

It didn’t.

It made the nausea worse.

I stumbled to a low wall near the entrance and sat down. I pressed my palms against my thighs, anchoring myself. The world was too bright and too loud and too far away.

I stared at the street and tried to keep my eyes open.

Don’t pass out. Don’t pass out. Don’t pass out.

Headlights swung around the corner and pulled up.

Lauren’s car.

The door opened and there she was—hair pulled back, face set, that particular mother-steel expression that says: *I am here and the world will now behave.*

She crossed to me quickly.

“Sarah,” she said, and crouched slightly so she was level with my face. “Look at me.”

I did. It took effort. But I did.

“Can you stand?” she asked.

“I—” My voice wobbled. “I think—”

“Okay,” she said. “We’re not rushing. Bree’s not here, so I’m your hands. Give me your bag.”

I handed it over like a child, and the humiliation should have killed me.

It didn’t.

Because Lauren didn’t treat me like a child.

She treated me like a woman whose body had been compromised and needed a plan.

Lauren slid an arm around my shoulders—firm, steady—and helped me stand.

“Walk with me,” she said.

I walked.

Each step felt like it was happening through water.

Lauren got me into the car, buckled my seatbelt with brisk competence, and shut the door like she was sealing me inside safety.

She got in and started the engine.

Only then did she speak again.

“I’m taking you to mine,” she said. “You’re not going home alone tonight.”

I swallowed. My throat felt wrong.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered automatically.

Lauren’s head snapped toward me.

“No,” she said, flat. “Not that. Not ever.”

The word landed like a slap and a hug at the same time.

I went quiet.

Lauren drove with one hand on the wheel and the other ready—just there, near the console, like she could catch me if my body tried to fall apart.

Halfway to her place, she asked, “Are you going to vomit?”

I blinked at the practical question, absurdly grateful for it.

“Maybe.”

“Okay,” she said. “There’s a bag. Use it if you need. You’re not embarrassing.”

I made a small sound that might have been a laugh if I’d had more oxygen.

At her apartment, Lauren guided me inside, shoes off, lights low, water poured.

She sat me on the couch and tucked a throw around my shoulders with the kind of efficiency that would make Mara nod once and say nothing.

Then Lauren crouched in front of me again.

“Sarah,” she said, “I’m going to ask you something and you can answer yes or no.”

I nodded.

“Do you feel safe right now?”

I blinked hard.

“Yes,” I whispered.

“Good,” she said. “Then we slow down. We hydrate. We keep you awake enough to stay oriented. And if anything changes—breathing, chest, pain—we escalate.”

The word escalate should have frightened me.

Instead it steadied me.

Because Lauren wasn’t guessing.

She was managing.

I leaned back into the couch, dizzy, and my eyes burned unexpectedly.

Lauren saw it and didn’t comment. She just sat beside me, not touching, present like a wall you could lean on.

After a while, the nausea eased into something duller. The panic receded, replaced by exhaustion.

Lauren handed me another glass of water.

I drank.

My hands shook.

Lauren watched without judgement.

The silence stretched.

And in that silence, my brain—traitorous, inconvenient—offered me the thought I’d been avoiding all night:

*You called her.*

Not Bree.

Not the police.

Her.

Because somewhere in my body, Lauren had become the definition of “safe.”

Not as a concept.

As a person.

Lauren checked her phone, then looked at me.

“Do you want me to call Bree?” she asked gently.

I hesitated. Then shook my head.

“No,” I said, voice rough. “Not yet.”

Lauren didn’t press.

“Okay,” she said. “Then you sleep here. Bedroom’s yours. Door closes. I’ll be in the lounge.”

My throat tightened.

“You don’t have to—”

Lauren’s look cut clean through me.

“I do,” she said. “Because you’re not going to wake up alone and wonder if you imagined it.”

I swallowed.

“Okay,” I whispered.

Lauren stood, then paused.

“And Sarah,” she added, softer, “tomorrow we can talk about reporting it. Or checking in medically. Or none of that. But tonight you’re just… alive. That’s the job.”

Alive.

That word landed in my chest like a weight.

She guided me to the bedroom—nothing intimate, nothing loaded—just a woman escorting another woman to safety. She handed me a clean t-shirt, pointed at the bathroom, left the door ajar.

I changed slowly, clumsy and tired, then crawled into the bed like it belonged to someone else.

The room was dark and quiet.

I heard Lauren moving softly in the lounge—kettle, cupboard, the small sounds of a competent woman keeping watch without announcing it.

And then I slept.

---

In the morning, my mouth tasted like regret and my head felt full of sand.

I lay still for a moment, letting the hangover assemble itself into a coherent list of complaints.

Then I remembered everything.

The bar. The wrongness. The bench outside. Lauren’s voice, steady as a handrail.

The shame hit next—automatic, predictable.

*You’re thirty-something and you called someone’s mum.*

I sat up too quickly and had to stop. The room tilted. I pressed my palm to my forehead, breathing through it.

A tap at the door.

Lauren’s voice, careful. “You awake?”

“Yes,” I croaked.

She came in with water and toast like she’d done it a thousand times, and maybe she had.

She set the tray on the bedside table and looked at me, not hovering.

“How’s your head?” she asked.

“Like someone built a shed inside it,” I muttered.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Fair.”

I took the water with both hands. Drank. Slowly.

Lauren sat on the chair near the window, not on the bed—space respected.

“Do you remember what happened?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice went quieter. “I… felt wrong. Too fast.”

Lauren nodded, filing it.

“Okay,” she said. “We don’t have to decide anything this second. But I want you to know: you did the right thing calling.”

The words landed, warm and sharp.

I stared at the toast like it contained answers.

“I didn’t want to bother you,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze held mine.

“You didn’t bother me,” she replied. “You trusted me.”

My throat tightened again, stupidly.

I tried to deflect.

“Because you’re terrifying,” I said dryly.

Lauren’s laugh was small. “I’ll take it.”

I took another sip of water, hands still slightly shaky.

Then I said the thing that had been sitting in my chest since the bench outside the bar.

“Lauren,” I began, and my voice caught. “I… I think I use you as—”

“A safety blanket,” Lauren finished gently, not mocking.

I blinked, embarrassed.

Lauren tilted her head.

“It’s not an insult,” she said. “You were scared. You reached for the safest person you know. That’s rational.”

I looked down at my hands.

“But,” Lauren continued, quiet now, “I don’t think that’s the whole truth.”

My pulse did a strange, hot little stumble.

I looked up.

Lauren’s expression was open—still adult, still in control—but softer than I’d ever seen it, like she was allowing herself to be human in front of me.

“Sarah,” she said, “you don’t have to decide anything today. But you should know something.”

I waited. Breath held.

“I like you,” Lauren said. Simple. Clean. “As you are. Sharp. Difficult. Funny. Honest when it costs you.”

The room went very still.

My skin prickled.

I should have made a joke.

I couldn’t.

Lauren didn’t move closer. She didn’t take my hand. She didn’t try to seal the moment into a story.

She just let the truth sit there, like a cup placed gently on a table.

And in the quiet that followed, I realised—with a clarity that made my chest ache—that this feeling in me wasn’t relief anymore.

It wasn’t gratitude.

It wasn’t even safety.

It was… wanting.

Not loud. Not dramatic.

Just a steady, inconvenient pull toward the woman in the chair.

I swallowed, suddenly terrified—not of her, not of intimacy, but of the sheer scale of how much sense it made.

“I’m not—” I started, and stopped.

Lauren waited, patient.

I took a breath, careful.

“I think,” I said slowly, “I called you because I wanted you to come.”

Lauren’s eyes softened.

“Yes,” she said, so quiet it was almost a whisper. “I know.”

My heart thudded once, hard.

I stared at her, and for the first time in a long time I didn’t feel like I had to be clever to be safe.

I just had to be honest.

“I don’t know what to do with that,” I admitted.

Lauren nodded once.

“Good,” she said. “Then we do nothing dramatic. We do boring.”

I huffed a laugh. “Boring.”

“Boring,” Lauren confirmed. “Tea. Toast. Water. A quiet day. And later—when your head stops trying to kill you—we talk. Like adults.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t shame.

It was something warmer.

Something that felt, inconveniently, like hope.

I nodded.

“Okay,” I said.

And Lauren’s smile—small, steady—was the softest kind of victory.

Not conquest.

Not rescue.

Just two women, choosing to treat the moment with care.

Like everything else in our world that mattered. 💛

“Okay,” she said. “We don’t have to decide anything this second. But I want you to know: you did the right thing calling.”

The words landed, warm and sharp.

I stared at the toast like it contained answers.

“I didn’t want to bother you,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze held mine.

“You didn’t bother me,” she replied. “You trusted me.”

My throat tightened again, stupidly.

I tried to deflect.

“Because you’re terrifying,” I said dryly.

Lauren’s laugh was small. “I’ll take it.”

I took another sip of water, hands still slightly shaky.

Then I said the thing that had been sitting in my chest since the bench outside the bar.

“Lauren,” I began, and my voice caught. “I… I think I use you as—”

“A safety blanket,” Lauren finished gently, not mocking.

I blinked, embarrassed.

Lauren tilted her head.

“It’s not an insult,” she said. “You were scared. You reached for the safest person you know. That’s rational.”

I looked down at my hands.

“But,” Lauren continued, quiet now, “I don’t think that’s the whole truth.”

My pulse did a strange, hot little stumble.

I looked up.

Lauren’s expression was open—still adult, still in control—but softer than I’d ever seen it, like she was allowing herself to be human in front of me.

“Sarah,” she said, “you don’t have to decide anything today. But you should know something.”

I waited. Breath held.

“I like you,” Lauren said. Simple. Clean. “As you are. Sharp. Difficult. Funny. Honest when it costs you.”

The room went very still.

My skin prickled.

I should have made a joke.

I couldn’t.

Lauren didn’t move closer. She didn’t take my hand. She didn’t try to seal the moment into a story.

She just let the truth sit there, like a cup placed gently on a table.

And in the quiet that followed, I realised—with a clarity that made my chest ache—that this feeling in me wasn’t relief anymore.

It wasn’t gratitude.

It wasn’t even safety.

It was… wanting.

Not loud. Not dramatic.

Just a steady, inconvenient pull toward the woman in the chair.

I swallowed, suddenly terrified—not of her, not of intimacy, but of the sheer scale of how much sense it made.

“I’m not—” I started, and stopped.

Lauren waited, patient.

I took a breath, careful.

“I think,” I said slowly, “I called you because I wanted you to come.”

Lauren’s eyes softened.

“Yes,” she said, so quiet it was almost a whisper. “I know.”

My heart thudded once, hard.

I stared at her, and for the first time in a long time I didn’t feel like I had to be clever to be safe.

I just had to be honest.

“I don’t know what to do with that,” I admitted.

Lauren nodded once.

“Good,” she said. “Then we do nothing dramatic. We do boring.”

I huffed a laugh. “Boring.”

“Boring,” Lauren confirmed. “Tea. Toast. Water. A quiet day. And later—when your head stops trying to kill you—we talk. Like adults.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t shame.

It was something warmer.

Something that felt, inconveniently, like hope.

I nodded.

“Okay,” I said.

And Lauren’s smile—small, steady—was the softest kind of victory.

Not conquest.

Not rescue.

Just two women, choosing to treat the moment with care.

Like everything else in our world that mattered. 💛
