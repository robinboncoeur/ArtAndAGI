**Scene 42 — “Carl” (Sarah POV)**

The annoying thing about having a small awakening is that the world doesn’t stop to let you process it.

Bree and Lily glow their way through Wardrobe like a private weather system, and then the next minute you’re back to pinning hems and pretending you didn’t just witness a version of happiness that made your stomach do a weird, traitorous little flip.

I tried to file it under **Not My Problem**.

It didn’t stay filed.

For the rest of the week, I kept catching myself watching them—tiny touches, shared looks, that relaxed certainty between them. Not performative. Not defensive. Not asking permission.

Just… two women who were done negotiating whether their wanting was valid.

Every time I noticed it, I felt the same thought arrive, uninvited, like a notification you can’t swipe away:

*That looks nice.*

Which was a ridiculous thing to think, because I was in the middle of the Ethan aftermath and my nervous system still had that “every door might have a man behind it” edge.

So, naturally, the universe offered me a man who was… fine.

Not “fine” as in attractive. Fine as in: not a walking hazard. Not an entitled toddler in an adult body. Not a replacement-mum seeker.

Fine as in: decent.

His name was Carl.

I met him on a Thursday in a way so ordinary it almost felt staged.

The Faire had sent someone to check on the lighting in the small dressing corridor—the one that always flickered when the iron was on, the one Mara had been muttering about for days like it was a personal insult. We’d been told “an electrician” was coming. Which, in my experience, can mean anything from “competent professional” to “man who explains wires to women as if we’re newborn calves.”

Carl walked in carrying a tool bag and a clipboard and the sort of calm that doesn’t feel like a performance.

He paused at the threshold—not swaggering, not barging—and looked around like he was assessing the room the way you assess a dog: with respect.

“Hi,” he said. “I’m Carl. I’m here for the corridor lights.”

Lauren looked up. “Great. Thank you. It’s that corridor—second door on the right.”

Carl nodded. “No worries. Is anyone using it right now?”

The sentence was so innocuous that it took my brain a second to recognise why it felt… notable.

He’d asked.

He hadn’t assumed the space was his because he had tools.

Lauren pointed. “We can reroute for ten minutes.”

“Perfect,” Carl said, and he smiled in a polite, non-invasive way. “I’ll be quick.”

He didn’t look at anyone’s body.

He didn’t linger.

He didn’t do the thing where men scan a room to see who might be impressed by them.

He went to the corridor and started working.

I found myself watching him, purely out of suspicion. Suspicion is my love language, unfortunately.

Carl pulled the panel off, tested something, frowned—not dramatically, just thoughtfully.

Then he called back into the room, voice normal.

“Hey—who’s been running the iron off this circuit?”

Mara didn’t look up. “We run everything off everything. Fix it.”

Carl chuckled once—one of those quick, genuine laughs—and said, “Right. Okay. I’ll reroute. Give me five.”

Mara grunted, which for Mara is basically a poem.

Ten minutes later the corridor lights were steady. No flicker. No drama.

Carl came back into the room, wiped his hands on a rag, and said to Lauren, “All done. I moved the iron load off the corridor. Should be stable now.”

Lauren nodded. “Thank you.”

Carl hesitated, then added, “If it flickers again, text the number on the work order. Don’t wait. It’s easier to fix early.”

Again: *he asked*, *he explained*, *he gave a solution*, and then he stopped talking.

It was… disconcerting.

As he turned to leave, his gaze met mine for half a second. Not lingering. Not hungry. Just human.

He gave a small nod.

I nodded back, because I am not feral either.

And then he said, as if he’d debated it and decided not to be weird:

“Sorry—are you Sarah?”

I froze, instantly.

Men knowing my name without me giving it to them is a known trigger. A small one. But real.

Carl clocked my stillness immediately.

He lifted his hands slightly, palms open—not theatrical, just reflexively reassuring.

“Bree mentioned you,” he said. “Only because I asked who handles the staff passes. She said you’re the one who knows where everything is.”

Ah. Bree. Of course.

I exhaled slowly, annoyed at my own body for being so quick to brace.

“What did she tell you,” I said, dry.

Carl’s mouth twitched. “That you’re terrifying,” he said, equally dry. “And that if I needed anything, I should ask politely and leave you alone.”

I snorted—an actual, involuntary sound—and felt, irritatingly, my shoulders loosen.

“Well,” I said, “Bree’s not wrong.”

Carl nodded like he’d just received a useful manual. “Good to know.”

Then he did something genuinely rare.

He didn’t push.

He didn’t use that opening to wedge himself into my day.

He simply added, “Anyway. Nice to meet you. I’ll get out of your way.”

And he left.

No lingering. No “maybe I’ll see you around.” No invitation snuck in under a joke.

Just… gone.

I stared after him for a moment, unsettled.

Bree appeared beside me like a cat, grin already loaded.

“You’re welcome,” she said.

I glared. “For what.”

“For Carl,” Bree said, smug. “He’s a nice bloke. I pre-approved him.”

“You don’t get to pre-approve men,” I said.

Bree shrugged. “I do when they’re harmless.”

“Harmless men are a myth,” I muttered.

Bree leaned closer, conspiratorial. “He bakes.”

I turned slowly. “That’s not a personality.”

“It’s a domestic competency,” Bree corrected. “Which, apparently, is your love language now.”

I rolled my eyes so hard I nearly saw my own brain.

“Stop trying to set me up,” I said.

Bree’s grin widened. “I’m not. He asked about you. I answered. If he asks you out, that’s on him.”

“I am not a charity,” I said.

Bree held up a hand. “Agreed. Which is why he’s the only man I know who might survive your standards.”

I wanted to argue.

But the irritating part was: I didn’t feel a need to.

That evening, as I was locking up my car, my phone buzzed.

Unknown number.

I almost didn’t answer. Then the text came through first.

> **Carl:** Hi Sarah—Carl here (electrician from today). Bree gave me your number *only if* I promised not to be a pest.
> If you’d ever like a coffee, I’d enjoy that. No pressure either way.

I stared at it.

The “no pressure” could have been a tactic.

But it didn’t read like a tactic.

It read like a man who understood that pressure is exactly how you lose a woman like me.

I typed. Deleted. Typed again.

I could feel my own resistance rising, automatic and familiar.

A man wants something. Therefore I must prepare for him to take it.

Except… that’s not what this was.

This was an invitation with an exit built in.

Which is, frankly, a rare competence.

I found myself thinking of Bree and Lily—radiant and unashamed—and the way their wanting didn’t come with a hidden invoice.

Then I thought of Ethan, and how quickly wanting had turned into entitlement.

And then I realised: the real question wasn’t “is Carl safe?”

It was:

*Am I even interested?*

I didn’t know.

Which annoyed me, because I like knowing.

Still, there was another truth sitting underneath my irritation:

I wanted to see what it felt like to be around a man who didn’t make my boundary management a full-time job.

So I replied, short and clear.

> **Me:** Coffee is fine. One hour. Public. Saturday afternoon.
> If you’re late, I leave.

The reply came quickly.

> **Carl:** Perfect. Saturday. I’ll be early.
> And thank you.

I blinked.

Thank you?

Not for agreeing. Not for giving him a chance.

Thank you for being clear.

I stared at the screen for a moment, then put my phone away and locked my car.

As I walked toward my building, I felt… cautious.

Not hopeful. Not giddy.

But cautiously curious.

And that, for me, was almost romantic.
