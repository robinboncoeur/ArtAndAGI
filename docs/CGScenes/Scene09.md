Scene 5
✨ Second Day ✨

[Celeste POV]



**Signal vs Noise**

Absolutely. Here’s a revised Scene 9 with the changes implemented cleanly and decisively: the “Rossignol” moment is either made legible as Mara’s procedural register, the “apology” mismatch is fixed, the jacket “tear vs pull” escalation is clarified, Lauren’s competence is strengthened with a practical risk/paperwork line, and a couple of repeated metaphors are refreshed without losing your seam/infrastructure motif.

---

## Scene 9 (revised)  —  Celeste POV

Lauren arrived on a Tuesday, which I noticed only because Tuesdays were the days Mara tried to pretend she had time.

She didn’t, of course. Mara never did. But Tuesdays were when she scheduled her stubbornness. The cutting table was clear, the mannequin was dressed in half a bodice, and the new jacket prototype sat like a dare: *make me survive.*

Lauren stepped in with a flat folder under her arm and a tote on her shoulder. No coffee this time. No pastry peace offering. She looked neat, composed, and slightly sharpened around the edges, as if she’d spent the morning refusing to be moved by other people’s urgency. Mara glanced up.

“What now,” she said dryly, as if Lauren had become a regular inconvenience she secretly approved of.

Lauren didn’t waste time warming the air.

“They called again.”

She didn’t specify who. She didn’t need to. Systems rarely needed names. They just kept turning  —  always in the way. Mara’s mouth tightened.

“And.”

“And I told them I’d call back,” Lauren replied, and there was a quiet satisfaction in the sentence. Not triumph. Just control. “Which I won’t, unless I have to.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the folder.

“What’s that?”

Lauren placed the folder on the corner of the worktable, away from fabric, and opened it with a deliberate neatness  —  like she could handle paper without absorbing it. Inside were two things: an envelope and a printed sheet.

The envelope was plain and official-looking. Lauren didn’t open it. She let it sit there like a dead insect.

The printed sheet she slid forward.

It was a photograph of one of the faire staff  —  Lucy  —  wearing the new jacket prototype. Lucy’s arms were raised in a dramatic pose, the kind that usually tore seams under the arm and split closures at the waist. But here the jacket held: clean line, no gaping, no strain. It looked like it had been designed for a body instead of a mannequin fantasy. Below the photo, Lauren had typed a short list. Not poetic, not emotional, just facts:

* **Previous issue:** underarm seam tearing after repeated movement
* **Change:** reinforced gusset + eased sleeve head + seam tape at stress line
* **Result:** 3 full shifts; no tear; improved comfort; faster dressing
* **Notes:** closure placement adjusted for quick change; no snagging

It was written like an incident report. Like a nurse charting patient progress in a ward. Like a woman who didn’t trust feelings to convince anyone. Mara stared at it.

Lauren said, evenly, “This is signal.”

Then she indicated the envelope without looking at it.

“And that,” she added, “is noise.”

Mara’s mouth twitched as her eyebrows rose slightly  —  almost amused, almost approving.

“You’ve been busy.”

Lauren shrugged. “I’ve been paying attention.”

Something settled in my chest that wasn’t relief exactly. More like load-bearing. Women reinforcing each other the way we reinforced garments  —  because pressure finds seams, and we weren’t going to split. Across the room, Charlie was at the side bench, pinning a lining into a bodice piece. He hadn’t looked up when Lauren entered; he never did. He didn’t seek permission for his attention. That was part of why Wardrobe suited him. Here, no one had to perform being seen.

But he did look now.

Not to the photo at first. To the envelope.

Something in him still reacted to official paper the way some people react to sirens — an instinctive tightening in the gut. His hands slowed. A pin hovered between his fingers. Lauren noticed without turning. Mothers always did.

“Don’t,” she said quietly.

Charlie blinked. “Don’t... what?”

“Don’t go pale,” Lauren replied. No cruelty in it, just blunt care. “You’re not in trouble in this room.”

He swallowed and looked down at his hands again, willing them back to normal speed. Mara picked up the printed sheet and read it properly. You could tell when she stopped seeing it as a thing someone had handed her and started seeing it as information. Her eyes tracked the lines. Her thumb pressed the paper unconsciously, testing it as if it were cloth.

“This,” Mara said thoughtfully, tapping the list, “is actually quite useful.”

Lauren’s lips thinned, determined. “That’s the idea.”

Mara’s gaze slid to the envelope.

“And that.”

Lauren’s expression sharpened.

“They want a meeting,” she said. “They want ‘pathways’. They want him back in a system that already told him what it thinks of him.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed.

“And what do you think.”

Lauren didn’t answer quickly. She glanced at Charlie  —  a brief, controlled glance  —  then turned back to Mara.

“I think,” she said, “that if he goes back there now, he’ll disappear again. Not dramatically. Not loudly. He’ll just... turn off.”

My throat tightened a fraction. She was exactly right. Charlie didn’t explode; he evaporated.

“And I think,” Lauren continued, still calm, “that if he stays here, he’ll have to show up. You don’t allow drifting. You don’t allow hiding. You make him do something... important. *For him.* This is real.”

Mara didn’t soften. That wasn’t her style. But she did something else: she accepted the statement as if it were a contract.

“He works,” she agreed.

Lauren nodded. “Yes. He works.”

Mara set the paper down carefully, the way you set down something you intend to keep.

“So what are you asking me for?”

Lauren met her gaze.

“Permission,” she said. “Not for him. *For me*.”

Mara’s eyebrow lifted.

“Sorry?”

Lauren’s mouth tightened, and for the first time her voice showed a thread of vulnerability — but framed the way women did when they refused to make their needs into someone else’s burden.

“I want to be able to say, truthfully, that he isn’t ‘dropping out.’ He’s transitioning into supervised work. Training. Something with standards. Something you’re willing to put your name on.”

Mara’s gaze held hers.

“You want me on the hook,” Mara said.

Lauren didn’t flinch. “Yes.” Then, because she understood what “hook” meant in a world of liabilities, she added — matter-of-fact:

“I’ll handle the paperwork and the school. Work placement language. Attendance logs. If anyone wants a form, I’ll give them a form. You handle standards. I handle noise.”

A beat.

Mara looked across the room at Charlie, who had resumed pinning, slower than before but steady. He wasn’t eavesdropping; he was simply present enough to feel the air changing.

Mara’s eyes returned to Lauren.

“You’re not asking for a favour then, are you?” she said. “You’re asking for a structure.”

“Exactly.”

Mara exhaled through her nose. She didn’t like being managed. But she liked competence. She liked women who spoke plainly.

“Fine,” Mara said. “Here’s the structure. He is here full-time. He keeps hours. He logs tasks. He does training modules the way I set them. He gets evaluated like all my staff. And if he fails, he fails. He doesn’t get protected by his mother.”

Charlie’s hand stopped again, just for a fraction.

Lauren’s voice didn’t soften. This was the contract.

“Agreed.”

Charlie looked up then  —  finally  —  and his gaze flicked from Lauren to Mara, and then, briefly, to me. Bewildered in the way he always was when adults made decisions near him, as if he didn’t know whether he was about to be punished or adopted.

Mara called him without raising her voice.

“Rossignol.”

It was what Mara did when the room needed to understand: this wasn’t intimacy; this was procedure. Charlie stood quickly, like someone trained by women: respectful, attentive, not wasting anyone’s time.

“Yes?”

Mara held up the printed sheet.

“Your mother brought receipts,” Mara said. “This is how you win against paperwork. We will do this properly.”

Charlie stared at the photo. His mouth parted slightly. Genuinely confused  —  not by the garment, but by the fact his work had been recorded like it mattered. Lauren spoke then, not to soothe him, not to praise him into embarrassment, but to anchor him.

“They can recommend whatever they like,” she said, her tone clipped. “I’m your mother. I decide what works. For. You.”

“Mum, I — ”

“No,” Lauren cut in, gentle but firm. “Don’t explain. I’m not asking for that. I’m asking you to stay... **visible**.”

Charlie blinked. The word *visible* hit him like a strange request. Visibility had never been safe. Mara snapped it back into something he could hold.

“Visible,” Mara said, “means you write down what you do. You show up on time. You finish tasks. You don’t vanish. You want to be here? Then you exist. *Visibly*.”

Charlie’s throat bobbed. He nodded once.

“Yes,” he said. “I can do that.”

“Good,” Mara said, and turned briskly back to the mannequin. “You can start now.” She gestured at the prototype jacket.

“We solved the tear,” Mara said. “Now I want the pull solved. Lucy can lift her arms without ripping it, but she shouldn’t feel it *fighting* her.”

She didn’t look at Lauren when she added the rest  —  because this wasn’t for Lauren. This was for the garment, and for the room.

“I want it solved so it survives summer heat and tourists and the stupid way people grab sleeves,” Mara continued. “I want it solved without adding bulk that ruins the silhouette.”

She looked at Charlie sharply.

“Tell me where it fails.”

Charlie stepped closer to the mannequin. His hands didn’t tremble. That was the difference between school and here: here, hands were allowed to be useful. He lifted the sleeve gently and pressed the seam line with his fingertips. His eyes narrowed, focused.

“It’s not the seam,” he said quietly. “It’s the angle. The gusset’s correct, but the sleeve head is fighting it. You need two millimetres more ease here... and the tape needs to stop before the pivot point, not run through it.”

Mara’s face changed  —  not dramatically, because Mara’s face never did  —  just the tiny shift of a professional hearing a solution that makes sense.

“That,” Mara said, “is an answer.”

Lauren watched him with that restrained pride again. Not soft. Not indulgent. Just steady. And watching the three of them in the same room  —  Mara with her standards, Lauren with her adult refusal to be bullied by systems, Charlie with his quiet competence  —  I felt something click into place.

Not rescue. Not refuge.

A triangle of authority that could hold.

Lauren reached for the envelope at last, slid it back into the folder without opening it, and closed the folder with a neat, final motion.

“Alright,” she said. “Now I can call them back.”

Mara didn’t look up from the sleeve.

“Tell them he’s busy.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “I will.”

Then she picked up her tote, nodded once at me — not warmth, exactly, but acknowledgment — and moved to the door. As she left, she paused and looked back at Mara.

“Thank you.”

Mara didn’t accept gratitude the way most people did. She accepted it the way she accepted fabric swatches: with suspicion.

“Don’t thank me,” Mara said. “Just don’t undermine me.”

“I won’t.”

The door clicked shut.

In the quiet that followed, Charlie returned to the mannequin and began marking the line with tailor’s chalk, his movements careful and certain.

And I thought: **this is what he needed.** Not a kinder classroom. A room where competence was not entertainment. A room where women built reality and demanded he live inside it.

A room where the system’s noise could stay outside the door  —  because inside, we had signal.

Scene 5
✨ Noise or Signal ✨


[Celeste]

“What now,” she said dryly. She had made no secret, to me at least, that Lauren had become a regular inconvenience she secretly approved of. 

Lauren didn’t waste time warming the air.

“They called again.”

She didn’t specify who. She didn’t need to. Systems rarely needed names. They just kept turning up — always in the way. Mara’s mouth tightened.

“And.”

“And I told them I would call back,” Lauren replied, and there was a quiet satisfaction in the tone of her voice. “Which I won’t, unless I have to.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the folder.

“What’s that?”

Lauren placed the folder on the corner of the worktable, away from fabric, and opened it with a deliberate neatness  —  like she could handle paper without abusing it. Inside were two things: an envelope and a printed sheet.

The envelope was plain and official-looking. Lauren didn’t open it. She let it sit there like a dead insect.

The printed sheet she slid forward.

It was a photograph of one of the Faire staff, Lucy, wearing the new jacket prototype. Lucy’s arms were raised in a dramatic pose, the kind that usually tore seams under the arm and split closures at the waist. But here the jacket held: clean line, no gaping, no strain. It looked like it had been designed for a body instead of a mannequin fantasy. 

Below the photo was a short list—typed, neat. The language was plain, factual... and oddly familiar. It wasn’t invented. It was compiled: Lucy’s wear-notes, Mara’s changes, and Charlie’s little scratch observations translated into something that could survive a meeting:

* Previous issue: underarm seam tearing after repeated movement
* Change: reinforced gusset + eased sleeve head + seam tape at stress line
* Result: 3 full shifts; no tear; improved comfort; faster dressing
* Notes: closure placement adjusted for quick change; no snagging

It was written like an incident report. Like a nurse charting patient progress in a ward. Like a woman who didn’t trust feelings to convince anyone. Mara stared at it.

That was part of why Wardrobe suited him: here, no one performed to be seen.

Not to the photo: the envelope. Something in him still reacted to official paper the way some people react to sirens... an instinctive tightening in the gut. His hands slowed. A pin hovered between his fingers. Lauren's eyes said she noticed without turning actually look. Mothers always did.

“Don’t,” she said quietly.

Charlie blinked. “Don’t... what?”

“Don’t go pale,” Lauren replied. Blunt, real care. “You’re not in trouble here.”

He swallowed and looked down at his hands again, willing them back to normal speed. Mara picked up the printed sheet and read it properly.

My throat tightened a fraction. She was exactly right. Charlie didn’t explode; he evaporated.

“And I think,” Lauren continued, still calm, “that if he stays here, he’ll show up. He'll work. He'll grow. This place doesn’t allow drifting. It doesn’t allow hiding. It makes him... move forward. This is real.”

Mara didn’t soften. That wasn’t her style. But she did something else: she accepted the statement as if it were a contract.

“He works,” she agreed.

Lauren nodded. “Yes. He works.”

Mara set the paper down carefully, the way you set down something you intend to keep.

“So what are you want from me?”

Lauren met her gaze.

“Permission,” she said. “Not for him. For me.”

Mara’s eyebrow lifted.

“Sorry?”

Lauren’s mouth tightened, and for the first time her voice showed a thread of vulnerability — but framed the way women did when they refused to make their needs into someone else’s burden.

“I want to be able to say, truthfully, that he isn’t ‘dropping out’. That he’s transitioning into supervised work. Real training, with standards. Something you’re willing to put your name on.”

“You’re not asking for a favour, then, are you?” she said. “You’re asking for a structure.”

“Exactly.”

Mara exhaled through her nose. She didn’t enjoy being directed — she never did — but she responded to competence the way she responded to a clean seam: she accepted it and moved on.

“Fine,” Mara said. “Here’s the structure. He is here full-time. He keeps hours. He logs tasks. He does training modules the way I set them. He gets evaluated like all my staff. And if he fails, he fails. He doesn’t get protected by... anyone.”

Charlie’s hand stopped again, just for a fraction. Lauren’s voice didn’t soften. This was the contract.

“Agreed.”

Charlie looked up then, finally, and his gaze flicked from Lauren to Mara. Then, briefly, to me, bewilderment plain on his face. Adults were making decisions about him again. He was starting to shrink again, as if unsure whether he was about to be punished or adopted. Mara called him without raising her voice.

“Rossignol.”

Charlie stood quickly: respectful, attentive, not wasting anyone’s time.

“Yes?”

Mara held up the printed sheet that Lauren had carefully developed.

“Your mother brought receipts,” Mara said. “This is how you win: we do things properly.”

Charlie stared at the list. His mouth parted slightly. It wasn’t the jacket that confused him, it was the wording.

underarm seam tearing after repeated movement

He’d written those words. Not in a document, not like this, but on scraps of paper, half-muttered to himself. And here was a tidy document with his phrasing. Seeing it printed, formal, treated as evidence, was what made his mouth drop open. He looked up as Lauren spoke again.

“They can recommend whatever they like,” she said, her tone clipped. She was not talking about the document, but the school system, now. “I’m your mother. I decide what works. For. You.”

“Mum, I—”

“No,” Lauren cut in, gentle but firm. “I’m not asking for explanations. I’m asking you to stay... visible.”

Charlie’s throat worked. His gaze dropped to his hands like he was checking whether they were still his. Mara answered before the moment could turn sentimental.

“Visible means logged,” she said. “Hours. Tasks. Outcomes. If you want to be here, you exist on paper. That’s how you stay.”

“Visible,” Mara said, “means you write down what you do. You show up on time. You finish tasks. You don’t vanish. You want to be here? Then you exist. Visibly.”

Charlie’s throat bobbed as he nodded.

“Yes,” he said. “I can do that.”

“Good,” Mara said, and turned briskly back to the mannequin. “You can start now.” She gestured at the prototype jacket. “We solved the tear,” she said. “Now I want the pull solved. Lucy can lift her arms without ripping it, but she shouldn’t feel it fighting her.”
