**Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.



<hr style="height:24px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">


So, what you don't see in that first image are the undergarments: dollars to donuts she's wearing stays. The second is classic Flux (dimpled chin) and yeah: Flux doesn't know about the chemise, which the first girl was wearing (layers: drawstring chemise; stays; overdress) so it does the lacey square neckline. I'm not sure, but your third girl (painting?) looks like Regency. And Stable Diffusion, bless its pointy little head, missed it by centuries: very Henry VIII. Again, the girl in green isn't wearing a chemise with stays... she's wearing a coset dress with a lace square neckline. Pretty, but it says "costume". 

Kontext has the overdress shape sort-or right but no chemise, again.

I ran the next girl image (outside, bonnet, book) by Emily... I was guessing Regency. Emily replied:

Yes — Regency / late Georgian is the right call 😊
What you’ve got here is very “Jane Austen era,” roughly 1805–1818 (give or take a few years):
High empire waist sitting just under the bust
Long, slim skirt that falls straight rather than bell-shaped
Narrow shoulders with only modest puffing (not the huge gigot sleeves of the 1830s)
Bonnet with ties that fits the early-19th silhouette beautifully

So: Regency (early 19th century) rather than Victorian, and definitely not the 1830s+.

### Pear-Shaped

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116az.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[xx-xx-xx]

**Scene 39 — “Pear-Shaped” (Sarah POV)**


It’s amazing how quickly a man can turn your boundary into his *personal tragedy*.

It’s also amazing how many of them genuinely believe that if they feel bad enough, the world will be obligated to comfort them.

Ethan doesn’t reply for an hour.

Which should have been a gift.

Instead it’s the quiet before the weather front.

By lunch I’ve had three missed calls.

By mid-afternoon he’s discovered email.

By four, there’s a notification from my building manager.

**Someone is downstairs asking for you. Says it’s urgent.**

I don’t even need to ask who.

My stomach doesn’t drop anymore. It goes cold. Efficient. Clinical.

I don’t leave my station. I don’t bolt. I don’t make it theatre.

I walk to Lauren’s corner of the room—because Lauren is the adult in the civilian world the way Mara is the adult in fabric—and I keep my voice low.

“He’s at my building,” I say.

Lauren’s face changes. Not into panic. Into calculation.

“Do you feel unsafe right now?” she asks.

“No,” I say. “But he’s escalating.”

Lauren nods once. “Okay. You’re not going home alone.”

“I’m not going home at all,” I say.

Lauren’s eyes flick to Mara, then back to me, as if checking what kind of support this room is allowed to give without turning into a rescue fantasy.

“Bree,” Lauren calls, matter-of-fact. Not loud. Just… inevitable.

Bree appears instantly, like she was waiting.

Lauren’s voice stays calm. “Sarah’s got a boundary issue. You’re her buddy for the rest of the shift. She doesn’t walk to her car alone. She doesn’t go anywhere alone. Clear?”

Bree’s grin is gone now. “Clear.”

Mara doesn’t look up. She taps her pen once against the ledger—tick, tick—as if she’s underlining Lauren’s sentence in her own language: **standards.**

Charli is at the cap table, and I feel her attention land on me like a soft hand. She doesn’t come over. She doesn’t insert herself.

She just… holds the room steady by existing in it.

Which is a strange kind of comfort.

I text the building manager back.

**Do not let him up. Tell him to leave. If he refuses, call police.**

Then I screenshot that too.

Evidence-gathering. Boring. Miraculous.

An hour later, another message comes in—this time from Ethan, of course.

> **Ethan:** You’re being insane.
> **Ethan:** I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
> **Ethan:** Don’t make me do something stupid.

There it is.

The classic line that tries to turn his behaviour into *my* responsibility.

My hands don’t shake. That’s the gift of being furious.

I show Lauren the screen.

Lauren’s jaw tightens, and she says, very quietly, “Nope.”

Not “oh no.”

Not “are you okay?”

Just: **nope.**

The word of a woman who has seen this move before and has zero intention of playing.

“Right,” she says. “We go formal.”

I blink. “Already?”

Lauren’s gaze is steady. “Sarah, he’s using implied threat language and turning up at your home. That’s already formal.”

I exhale slowly, because she’s right, and because I hate being right about men.

Lauren pulls her phone out, taps once, twice.

“Leave it with me,” she says. “You keep screenshots. Dates. Times. Don’t reply. Don’t explain. Don’t negotiate.”

It’s such a Lauren sentence: a list that becomes a lifeline.

Bree leans in beside me. “I’ll stay at yours tonight,” she says, like it’s nothing, like she’s offering to water a plant. “Or you stay at mine. Dealer’s choice.”

I look at her, touched in a way that is infuriating.

“I’m fine,” I say automatically.

Bree raises an eyebrow. “You’re not fine, babe. You’re just competent.”

Fair.

---

By the time the shift ends, I have a plan.

Not a dramatic plan.

A boring plan.

Lauren drives, Bree in the passenger seat, me in the back like a teenager being escorted home after a questionable party.

It’s humiliating.

Which means it’s good for me.

We don’t go to my building. We don’t reward his persistence with my presence. We go to Bree’s place first, because Bree has the kind of tiny apartment where a man would look ridiculous standing outside.

Lauren calls my building manager while we’re parked.

Her tone is polite enough to pass, steel enough to cut glass.

“Yes, thank you… no, I understand… please document that in your log… yes, call immediately if he returns… yes, we will be taking further steps.”

She ends the call and looks at me.

“He left,” she says. “But he’ll come back. So we close the loop.”

I swallow. “What loop.”

“The one where he thinks access is negotiable,” Lauren says.

We spend the next hour doing paperwork in the most unromantic way possible: names, times, screenshots, a short statement that says exactly what happened and nothing more.

Lauren doesn’t embellish. She doesn’t plead. She doesn’t tell a story.

She gives facts.

It’s terrifying how effective facts are when a woman uses them like a blade.

By the end of the night, I have an interim safety plan, a number to call, and a list of instructions so dull they could be a laundry guide.

Bree makes tea. Not to soothe. To keep us upright.

When Lauren finally stands to leave, she pauses at the door.

“Sarah,” she says, and her voice softens just a notch. “This isn’t your fault.”

I roll my eyes because I need to.

“I know.”

Lauren’s gaze doesn’t let me wriggle away.

“No,” she repeats gently. “*Really* know.”

I look away. Then back.

“I know,” I say again, and this time I mean it.

Lauren nods once, satisfied.

“I’ll check on you tomorrow,” she says. “And if he appears at Wardrobe, Mara will eat him alive.”

“Delicately,” Bree adds.

Lauren’s mouth twitches. “With a fork.”

She leaves.

Bree locks the door behind her, then looks at me with something like a sister’s appraisal.

“You want to go out tomorrow night?” she asks. “Just… shake it off?”

I huff. “You think I need shaking off.”

Bree points at me. “You need reminding that your life doesn’t belong to some man who can’t boil pasta.”

I hate that she’s right.

So I say, “Fine.”

---

The next night, I dress like myself.

Not sexy. Not soft. Not “approachable.”

I put on black jeans and boots and a top that says: **I know where my keys are**.

We go to a place Bree likes—music, crowd, women who laugh like they own their lungs.

For the first hour, it works.

I loosen. I laugh. I even forget to look at the door.

Then a man slides into our orbit like smoke.

He’s not Ethan. He’s the *same type*, just with better hair.

He talks to Bree as if I’m invisible, then talks to me as if I’m a resource. He’s charming in the way men are charming when they’re used to women smoothing the awkward parts for them.

I can feel myself tensing—old instincts waking up.

Bree clocks it and leans into my ear.

“Want me to bite him?” she whispers.

“I want you to set him on fire,” I mutter.

Bree snorts.

I decide to handle it like an adult.

I say, clear and calm, “We’re not interested.”

He smiles as if I’ve flirted.

“Aw, come on,” he says. “Don’t be like that.”

I feel the rage flicker—cold, familiar.

“Like what,” I say, sweetly. “A woman who said no?”

His smile tightens.

“Oh,” he says. “You’re one of those.”

Bree’s eyes flash. “And you’re one of *those*,” she replies, bright as a knife.

He laughs like we’re entertainment. He reaches for my elbow.

My whole body goes still.

Not fear.

History.

I step back.

“Don’t touch me,” I say.

He lifts both hands in mock surrender.

“Relax.”

Bree’s hand is suddenly on my back, steady.

“We’re leaving,” she says.

And we do.

We walk out into the night air, and it’s like walking from heat into cold water.

My hands are shaking now.

Bree looks at me. “You okay?”

I open my mouth to say yes.

Instead I say, “I’m furious.”

Bree nods, satisfied. “Good. Fury’s honest.”

We should go home.

We don’t.

Because I’m stubborn, and because part of me wants to prove I’m not a woman who has to retreat.

So when Bree suggests a quieter bar two streets over, I say yes.

And there—there is where I make my mistake.

I drink too fast.

Not because I’m trying to get drunk.

Because my nervous system is trying to come down and I’m sick of being vigilant.

One drink becomes two. Two becomes three.

My body softens before my mind is ready for it.

And then my phone buzzes.

A blocked number.

My stomach clenches.

Another buzz.

Another.

Bree’s face tightens when she sees mine.

“It’s him,” I say.

Bree grabs my hand. “We’re going. Now.”

But the street tilts a little when I stand. Not dramatic. Just enough.

Bree swears softly. “Okay. Okay. We’re fine. We get a rideshare—”

My brain does a quick, ugly calculation: my address, my building, Ethan’s persistence, the risk of being dropped at the wrong place, the risk of fumbling keys.

I do the only competent thing left.

I call the most competent woman I know who will not ask questions first.

Lauren.

She answers on the second ring.

“Sarah?”

My voice comes out too careful.

“Lauren,” I say. “I need you.”

There’s no sigh. No judgement. No lecture.

Just immediate clarity.

“Where are you?” she asks.

I tell her.

“Stay where you are,” she says. “With Bree?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I’m coming.”

I blink hard, suddenly close to tears, which is ridiculous.

“Thank you,” I manage.

Lauren’s voice stays firm.

“No thanks,” she says. “Just sit down and wait. I’ll be there.”

The line clicks off.

Bree wraps an arm around my shoulders, guiding me to a bench like I weigh nothing.

“You did good,” she says.

I laugh once, sharp and humourless.

“I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grins. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

I close my eyes for a second and breathe in the night.

And in the small, humiliating quiet of needing help, something in me loosens—something stubborn and old.

Maybe competence isn’t never needing anyone.

Maybe it’s knowing exactly which woman to call when the world goes pear-shaped.

---

If you’d like, the next scene can be **Lauren POV** arriving: brisk, protective, *no drama*, and she quietly clocks the deeper pattern (male entitlement, Sarah’s exhaustion, the way women keep having to do paperwork to be left alone). Then we can pivot back toward Wardrobe the next morning where Mara gets the one-sentence update and simply says: “Good. Now you’re done with him.” 💛

✨ A Better Bench ✨

You’re welcome, Robyn 💛 — here’s **Scene 39 revised** with the **two-bench motif made explicit** (work-bench vs home-bench), and with the “boring reliability” proof still doing the heavy lifting before warmth returns.

---

## Scene 39 — “A Better Bench” (Celeste POV)

Charli brought the water like it mattered.

Not in a theatrical way. Not rushing to prove something. Just… correctly. Two glasses, cold enough to fog slightly, set down with care. Then she sat again on the edge of the couch, hands quiet this time, not clenched like a penance.

I watched her do it and felt my own nervous system start to believe her.

That was the thing people didn’t understand about trust: it wasn’t repaired by big gestures. It was repaired by small, repeatable ones. Boring ones. The kind that didn’t require applause.

I took a sip. Let the cold settle in my throat.

Charli didn’t speak until I looked at her.

“You said,” she began, carefully, “to tell you what I need from you when I get scared.”

“Yes,” I said.

She swallowed. Her eyes flicked down, then back up, braver.

“I need… a way to tell you without feeling like I’m detonating your day,” she said. “Because that’s what it feels like. Like I’m throwing something at you that will make you… tired.”

I felt the old irritation rise—because she still had that wrong idea about me—but I kept my face calm. This wasn’t a lecture moment. This was a rebuilding moment.

“So you need a system,” I said.

She exhaled, relieved by the word. “Yes. A system.”

I nodded. “Good. I can do systems.”

Charli’s mouth trembled in something like gratitude, and she tried to hide it. She was learning, but she wasn’t cured.

“All right,” I said. “Here’s your system.”

Her posture changed instantly. Attention. Like a student who finally trusted the lesson was going to help her.

“When something changes at Wardrobe,” I said, “you tell me in three parts. One sentence each.”

Charli blinked. “Three parts.”

“First: what happened,” I said. “Second: what you felt. Third: what you’re afraid it will cause.”

Her eyes widened slightly.

“That’s…” she whispered, almost reverent. “That’s actually… doable.”

“It’s meant to be doable,” I said. “We’re not performing in here.”

Charli nodded, quick.

“And if you’re too scared to say it aloud,” I added, “you write it. You text it. You put it in my hand on a scrap of paper. But you do not carry it alone because you think you’re being noble.”

Her throat moved. She nodded again, slower.

“Okay,” she whispered.

I let the rule sit.

Then I leaned forward a fraction.

“Try it,” I said. “Now.”

Charli froze. Panic flashed. Then she caught herself—caught the old reflex—and took a breath like she was stepping into cold water.

“All right,” she said, and her voice shook only a little.

“One: what happened,” she began. “Sarah said… she told you… that the girls decided I was one of them. Properly. And that it had been happening for months.”

Her eyes darted to my face, as if waiting for punishment. I gave her none.

“Two,” she continued, steadier, “what I felt… was relieved. And terrified. Because it was good. And because it was real.”

She swallowed hard.

“And three,” she said, voice smaller, “what I was afraid it would cause… was you stepping back. You thinking I’d created a complication you didn’t ask for.”

She finished and sat very still, as if her body was waiting to see whether the floor would hold.

It did.

I nodded once.

“That,” I said, “is the truth. Well done.”

Charli’s eyes went glossy again. She didn’t apologise for it this time. She just blinked and held herself together.

“I can do that,” she whispered. “I can do it every time.”

“Yes,” I said. “You can.”

A silence settled.

Not hostile.

Not warm.

Just… stable.

Charli took a careful sip of her water. Put the glass down. Then she looked at me again, and I saw the question behind her eyes before she spoke it.

Not *Do you forgive me?*

Something more dangerous.

*Are you still going to want me?*

She didn’t ask.

Good. She was learning not to pull reassurance out of people like a bandage.

I stood.

Charli flinched.

I didn’t leave. I walked toward her—slow, deliberate—and sat down beside her on the couch.

Not pressed into her. Not collapsing into comfort. Beside. A choice. A signal.

Her breath caught.

I let my shoulder touch hers, lightly.

“This is me keeping my word,” I said. “Not you earning a treat.”

Charli turned her head toward me, eyes wide.

“I’m not rewarding you,” I continued, because she needed the clarity more than she needed romance. “I’m acknowledging behaviour change. There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled in a small, wrecked smile.

“I understand,” she whispered.

“Good.”

I let my hand find her wrist—just above the pulse. The smallest intimate contact. Controlled. Real.

Charli went still as if she’d been given something fragile to hold.

“There’s another thing,” I said.

She nodded quickly. “Yes.”

“You don’t get to protect me from truth,” I said. “But you can protect me from chaos.”

Charli blinked. “How.”

“By bringing it early,” I said. “By giving me reality while it’s still manageable. That’s what partnership is.”

Charli swallowed. Her eyes shone.

“Okay,” she said. “Yes.”

And then, so quietly I almost missed it:

“And if I’m scared,” she added, “I tell you that too. Not just the event.”

“Yes,” I said. “Especially that.”

She nodded again. Like she was storing the rule in her bones.

I watched her. A part of me wanted to pull her in, to make the earlier tenderness flood back in and wash the ugliness away.

But that would have been about my discomfort, not her education.

So I did it properly.

“Come,” I said.

Charli looked at me, startled. “Where?”

I stood, and she stood immediately, still tuned to my tone like it was music she trusted.

I didn’t take her back to the place where we’d first made promises in the shadow of Wardrobe.

That bench had been too close to consequences. Too close to the version of us that still thought silence was the same thing as safety.

It had held a beginning, yes—warm and heady and dangerous in the way beginnings can be.

But it wasn’t the bench I wanted now.

This one—near home—was for something else.

For keeping promises without hiding inside them.

I led her outside.

The air had cooled enough to feel like mercy. The day’s heat still clung to the ground, but the sharp edge had gone off it. The neighbourhood had settled into its evening sounds: a distant television, a dog that barked once and then remembered it didn’t care, the soft hush of trees when the breeze finally decided to show up.

The bench sat where it always sat—plain, unremarkable, made for waiting.

We sat anyway.

Charli sat with her hands in her lap again, as if she didn’t want to reach without permission.

I turned slightly toward her.

“This is a better bench,” I said, and I heard my own voice soften on the word *better* before I could stop it.

Charli looked at me, confused for a second.

Then understanding arrived in her eyes like light coming on.

“Because it’s… not near work,” she whispered.

“Because it’s not near fear,” I corrected, gently. “Not the old kind.”

Her throat moved.

“I said there would be more,” I continued. “And there will be.”

Charli’s eyes widened, a little helpless with emotion.

“But,” I added—because Celeste always included the terms—“it only happens in the open. No secrets. No curating. No trying to manage me.”

Charli nodded so hard it was almost painful to watch.

“Yes,” she breathed. “Yes. I—yes.”

I let the silence hold for a moment longer than was comfortable.

Then I touched her—slowly, deliberately—my palm at her cheek, thumb near the corner of her mouth.

Charli shivered. Not exaggerated. Real. The kind that comes from being seen and not punished for it.

“You’re allowed,” I murmured. “But you’re going to stay present.”

Her eyes fluttered shut.

“I am,” she whispered.

I kissed her.

Not as punctuation this time.

As a decision.

Charli kissed me back, careful at first, then a little more brave—as if she was learning that bravery could exist without secrecy attached to it.

When I pulled away, she didn’t scramble for reassurance. She didn’t ask if it was okay.

She just looked at me, breathing hard, eyes shining, staying.

That—more than the kiss—was the proof.

“I didn’t lose you,” she whispered, stunned, like she’d expected the story to end differently.

I leaned in until my forehead touched hers.

“You don’t lose me by telling me the truth,” I said. “You lose me by keeping it.”

Charli nodded, tiny.

“I understand,” she whispered.

“And,” I added, because she needed the final safety spoken aloud, “I’m not asking you to be fearless. I’m asking you to be honest while you’re afraid.”

Her breath shook out of her.

“I can do that,” she said, and this time it wasn’t desperation.

It was competence.

I let my hand slide down to take hers.

She squeezed once—small, fierce.

And I squeezed back.

Not reassurance.

Agreement.

The bench didn’t change anything.

We did.

✨ The Brush ✨

## Scene 39 — “Boring Miracles” (Celeste POV)

Charli brought the water like it mattered.

Not in a theatrical way. Not rushing to prove something. Just… correctly. Two glasses, cold enough to fog slightly, set down with care. Then she sat again on the edge of the couch, hands quiet this time, not clenched like a penance.

I watched her do it and felt my own nervous system start to believe her.

That was the thing people didn’t understand about trust: it wasn’t repaired by big gestures. It was repaired by small, repeatable ones. Boring ones. The kind that didn’t require applause.

I took a sip. Let the cold settle in my throat.

Charli didn’t speak until I looked at her.

“You said,” she began, carefully, “to tell you what I need from you when I get scared.”

“Yes,” I said.

She swallowed. Her eyes flicked down, then back up, braver.

“I need… a way to tell you without feeling like I’m detonating your day,” she said. “Because that’s what it feels like. Like I’m throwing something at you that will make you… tired.”

I felt the old irritation rise—because she still had that wrong idea about me—but I kept my face calm. This wasn’t a lecture moment. This was a rebuilding moment.

“So you need a system,” I said.

She exhaled, relieved by the word. “Yes. A system.”

I nodded. “Good. I can do systems.”

Charli’s mouth trembled in something like gratitude, and she tried to hide it. She was learning, but she wasn’t cured.

“All right,” I said. “Here’s your system.”

Her posture changed instantly. Attention. Like a student who finally trusted the lesson was going to help her.

“When something changes at Wardrobe,” I said, “you tell me in three parts. One sentence each.”

Charli blinked. “Three parts.”

“First: what happened,” I said. “Second: what you felt. Third: what you’re afraid it will cause.”

Her eyes widened slightly.

“That’s…” she whispered, almost reverent. “That’s actually… doable.”

“It’s *meant* to be doable,” I said. “We’re not performing in here.”

Charli nodded, quick.

“And if you’re too scared to say it aloud,” I added, “you write it. You text it. You put it in my hand on a scrap of paper. But you do not carry it alone because you think you’re being noble.”

Her throat moved. She nodded again, slower.

“Okay,” she whispered.

I let the rule sit.

Then I leaned forward a fraction.

“Try it,” I said. “Now.”

Charli froze. Panic flashed. Then she caught herself—caught the old reflex—and took a breath like she was stepping into cold water.

“All right,” she said, and her voice shook only a little.

“One: what happened,” she began. “Sarah said… she told you… that the girls decided I was one of them. Properly. And that it had been happening for months.”

Her eyes darted to my face, as if waiting for punishment. I gave her none.

“Two,” she continued, steadier, “what I felt… was relieved. And terrified. Because it was good. And because it was real.”

She swallowed hard.

“And three,” she said, voice smaller, “what I was afraid it would cause… was you stepping back. You thinking I’d created a complication you didn’t ask for.”

She finished and sat very still, as if her body was waiting to see whether the floor would hold.

It did.

I nodded once.

“That,” I said, “is the truth. Well done.”

Charli’s eyes went glossy again. She didn’t apologise for it this time. She just blinked and held herself together.

“I can do that,” she whispered. “I can do it every time.”

“Yes,” I said. “You can.”

A silence settled.

Not hostile.

Not warm.

Just… stable.

Charli took a careful sip of her water. Put the glass down. Then she looked at me again, and I saw the question behind her eyes before she spoke it.

Not *Do you forgive me?*

Something more dangerous.

*Are you still going to want me?*

She didn’t ask.

Good. She was learning not to pull reassurance out of people like a bandage.

I stood.

Charli flinched.

I didn’t leave. I walked toward her—slow, deliberate—and sat down beside her on the couch.

Not pressed into her. Not collapsing into comfort. Beside. A choice. A signal.

Her breath caught.

I let my shoulder touch hers, lightly.

Then I spoke, soft and firm at once.

“This is me keeping my word,” I said. “Not you earning a treat.”

Charli turned her head toward me, eyes wide.

“I’m not rewarding you,” I continued, because she needed the clarity more than she needed romance. “I’m acknowledging behaviour change. There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled in a small, wrecked smile.

“I understand,” she whispered.

“Good.”

I let my hand find her wrist—just above the pulse. The smallest intimate contact. Controlled. Real.

Charli went still as if she’d been given something fragile to hold.

“There’s another thing,” I said.

She nodded quickly. “Yes.”

“You don’t get to protect me from truth,” I said. “But you *can* protect me from chaos.”

Charli blinked. “How.”

“By bringing it early,” I said. “By giving me reality while it’s still manageable. That’s what partnership is.”

Charli swallowed. Her eyes shone.

“Okay,” she said. “Yes.”

And then, so quietly I almost missed it:

“And if I’m scared,” she added, “I tell you *that* too. Not just the event.”

“Yes,” I said. “Especially that.”

She nodded again. Like she was storing the rule in her bones.

I watched her. A part of me wanted to pull her in, to make the earlier tenderness flood back in and wash the ugliness away.

But that would have been about my discomfort, not her education.

So I did it properly.

“Come,” I said.

Charli looked at me, startled. “Where?”

I stood, and she stood immediately, still tuned to my tone like it was music she trusted.

I led her not to the bedroom, not to anything that would confuse the stakes.

I led her back outside, to the bench.

The air had cooled enough to feel like mercy. The day’s heat still clung to the ground, but the sharp edge had gone off it. The world had stopped glaring.

Charli sat when I sat. She kept her hands in her lap again, as if she didn’t want to reach without permission.

I turned slightly toward her.

“This is the bench,” I said.

Charli’s eyes widened, a little helpless with emotion.

“I remember,” she whispered.

“I said there would be more,” I continued. “And there will be.”

Charli’s throat moved.

“But,” I added—because Celeste always included the terms—“it only happens in the open. No secrets. No curating. No trying to manage me.”

Charli nodded so hard it was almost painful to watch.

“Yes,” she breathed. “Yes. I—yes.”

I let the silence hold for a moment longer than was comfortable.

Then I touched her—slowly, deliberately—my palm at her cheek, thumb near the corner of her mouth.

Charli shivered. Not exaggerated. Real. The kind that comes from being seen and not punished for it.

“You’re allowed,” I murmured. “But you’re going to stay present.”

Her eyes fluttered shut.

“I am,” she whispered.

I kissed her.

Not as punctuation this time.

As a decision.

Charli kissed me back, careful at first, then a little more brave—as if she was learning that bravery could exist without secrecy attached to it.

When I pulled away, she didn’t scramble for reassurance. She didn’t ask if it was okay.

She just looked at me, breathing hard, eyes shining, staying.

✨ A Better Bench ✨

**Scene 39 — “A Better Bench” (Celeste POV)**

Charli brought the water like it mattered.

So I did it properly.

“Come,” I said.

Charli looked at me, startled. “Where?”

I stood, and she stood immediately, still tuned to my tone like it was music she trusted.

I didn’t take her back to the place where we’d first made promises in the shadow of Wardrobe.

That bench had been too close to consequences. Too close to the version of us that still thought silence was the same thing as safety.

It had held a beginning, yes—warm and heady and dangerous in the way beginnings can be.

But it wasn’t the bench I wanted now.

This one—near home—was for something else.

For keeping promises without hiding inside them.

I led her outside.

The air had cooled enough to feel like mercy. The day’s heat still clung to the ground, but the sharp edge had gone off it. The neighbourhood had settled into its evening sounds: a distant television, a dog that barked once and then remembered it didn’t care, the soft hush of trees when the breeze finally decided to show up.

The bench sat where it always sat—plain, unremarkable, made for waiting.

We sat anyway.

Charli sat with her hands in her lap again, as if she didn’t want to reach without permission.

I turned slightly toward her.

“This is a better bench,” I said, and I heard my own voice soften on the word *better* before I could stop it.

Charli looked at me, confused for a second.

Then understanding arrived in her eyes like light coming on.

“Because it’s… not near work,” she whispered.

“Because it’s not near fear,” I corrected, gently. “Not the old kind.”

Her throat moved.

“I said there would be more,” I continued. “And there will be.”

Charli’s eyes widened, a little helpless with emotion.

“But,” I added—because Celeste always included the terms—“it only happens in the open. No secrets. No curating. No trying to manage me.”

## **Scene 41 — “Radiant” (Sarah POV)**

Wardrobe gets a particular kind of busy when the Faire women come in.

It’s not the everyday rhythm—steam and pins and Mara’s shears making their soft, confident threats. It’s something more theatrical: colour arriving, laughter arriving, the faint perfume of other lives. Actresses bring a kind of light with them. Not always pleasant, but undeniable.

They came in after lunch, a cluster of them, skirts and tote bags and big opinions. The room tightened into competence automatically: stations ready, fittings scheduled, tape measures uncoiled like quiet authority.

I was on my stool with a coffee, watching the threshold the way I always did—half habit, half sport—when Bree walked in with someone on her arm.

Not literally. Bree’s not a Victorian gentleman. But the posture was the same: the subtle lean toward, the easy angle of her shoulder, the way her body said *this person belongs with me* without needing to announce it.

Lily.

I’d seen Lily before. Everyone had. Lily was one of those women who made a room adjust itself—hair like a promise, laugh like she’d never once asked permission to take up space. She’d always been charming in a way that made me roll my eyes because I don’t trust charming.

But today she wasn’t performing.

Today she was… *lit.*

She walked in beside Bree and the two of them had that private, bright current running between them—little glances, tiny touches, the kind of unforced coordination you only get when two people have stopped negotiating whether they’re allowed to want each other.

Bree’s grin was wide and unashamed.

Lily’s hand brushed Bree’s wrist as they crossed the room, not coy, not possessive. Just… natural. Like reaching for warmth.

And it hit me—harder than I expected—that they looked happy.

Not “posting online” happy.

Not “prove something” happy.

Happy like a body that has stopped bracing.

I watched them as they moved toward the fitting area. Bree said something under her breath and Lily laughed—real laughter, head tipping back, eyes closing for half a beat. Bree’s face softened in response, like her whole nervous system had learned the shape of that sound.

I felt a strange, unwelcome thought rise up in me:

*That looks… nice.*

Then another one, even worse, because it arrived with zero moral framing and no permission slip from my brain:

*And she’s beautiful.*

I didn’t mean it as competition. I didn’t mean it as envy. I meant it as a fact my eyes observed, the way my eyes observe fabric quality.

Lily was objectively gorgeous.

But that wasn’t what made my stomach tilt.

It was the way Bree looked at her like she was the only thing in the room worth orienting toward.

Bree — who could be loud, chaotic, generous, irritating, wonderful — looked *quietly devoted.*

It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t a phase. It wasn’t a “girls being silly” interlude before returning to a man-shaped life.

It was… real.

I swallowed and made myself take a sip of coffee, because I needed my hands to do something that wasn’t betraying me.

Lily spotted Charli at the cap table and waved.

“Oh my god,” she called, delighted. “Look at you! You’re… you’re so *proper* now.”

Charli flushed, smiling in that bashful way she still had even with all her new steadiness.

“Hi,” Charli said, and didn’t apologise for the attention. Didn’t duck. Didn’t shrink.

She took the compliment like a girl who had learned she didn’t have to throw gifts back into people’s faces for safety.

Celeste glanced up from the ledger, calm as ever, and nodded once at Lily—polite, controlled, adult.

Then her gaze flicked to Charli for half a beat, and I caught it: the softness she tried so hard to hide.

Wardrobe saw everything. Even when people pretended it didn’t.

Mara clapped her hands once—sharp, decisive.

“Right,” she said. “You. Fitting room. You. Table. Stop talking and start standing still.”

The actresses laughed and obeyed, because Mara was the closest thing this room had to gravity.

Lily stepped closer to Bree and said, low but not private enough for my sharp ears not to catch it:

“You’re coming over tonight, yeah?”

Bree’s grin went lazy and warm. “Obviously.”

No apology. No awkwardness. No “if you want.” No “unless you’re busy.” No negotiation.

Just yes.

And in my chest, something shifted.

Not jealousy.

Not longing, not yet.

Something more uncomfortable:

recognition.

A kind of internal data point landing with a quiet thud: *that’s what it looks like when the wanting isn’t a problem.*

When the wanting isn’t shameful.

When the wanting doesn’t turn you into someone’s domestic function.

When it’s just… two women, deciding.

I sat there on my stool, coffee cooling, and watched Bree and Lily disappear into the fitting area together—Bree stepping aside to hold the curtain, Lily’s hand brushing her shoulder as she passed—and I realised, with faint annoyance, that I’d been holding my breath.

I let it out slowly.

Then I did what I always did when something hit too close:

I made it a joke in my own head.

*Well,* I thought, dryly, *that’s inconvenient.*

Because once you’ve seen a kind of happiness up close—real, radiant, unforced—it becomes very difficult to pretend you don’t know what you’re missing.

---

If you want, I’ll write **Scene 42 (“Carl”)** next — and I’ll make Carl genuinely likeable, respectful, emotionally literate… and still wrong for her, in a way that hurts *because* he’s decent. That’s the exact antidote to the trope you’re worried about. 💛

**Scene 39 — “The Golf Course Call” (Sarah POV, past tense)**

---

The morning light was mean.

It came in flat and bright through the blinds and made everything look too honest—discarded clothes, rumpled sheets, the empty space beside her like an accusation. Sarah sat on the edge of the bed and drank water straight from the glass, as if hydration could fix the taste he’d left in the room.

Her phone lay on the bedside table.

She stared at it.

It wasn’t rage that moved her, not really. Rage was messy. Rage implied investment.

This was simpler.

This was the quiet certainty of a woman realising she’d accepted something beneath her standards—and feeling, not shame, but irritation that she’d let it waste an evening of her life.

She thumbed her contacts. Found his name. Tapped.

It rang longer than it should’ve. Then the background noise came through—wind, men’s laughter, the hollow echo of open space.

“Hey,” he said, voice bright. Pleased with himself. “You alright?”

Sarah closed her eyes for a beat. Let his tone tell her everything she needed to know.

“Yep,” she said. “I’m ending this.”

A pause. Like he hadn’t heard her correctly.

“What?”

“I’m ending it,” Sarah repeated. She kept her voice calm on purpose. The calm was the point. “This relationship. Whatever we were pretending it was.”

His laugh came out wrong—too quick, too defensive. “What? Because of last night? Sarah—come on—”

Behind him someone called his name, muffled by distance.

“Mate, you teeing off or what?”

He lowered his voice. “Listen, you’re overthinking it. We’re good. We had fun. Don’t do this on the phone.”

Sarah looked at her own bare feet on the carpet. The ordinary domesticity of the moment almost amused her.

“This is actually the perfect place to do it,” she said. “You’re with your mates. You’ll recover. Quickly.”

He exhaled hard. “This is insane.”

“No,” Sarah said softly. “What’s insane is you thinking you get to argue about it.”

She could hear him shifting, moving away from the others. The wind buffeted the mic.

“Sarah, seriously—what do you *want* from me?” he demanded, like she was a faulty appliance.

The question was so revealing she almost thanked him.

“Tenderness,” she said, and let the single word sit there between them like a dropped glass.

He didn’t reply.

Not properly.

He did what men did when they were offered a feeling they couldn’t quantify.

He tried to bargain.

“I can be— I mean, I *am*—look, we can work on that.”

Sarah smiled without humour.

“That,” she said, “is the problem. It’s not a renovation project.”

He made a sound—frustrated, affronted. “So you’re just… done?”

“Yes.”

“I thought you liked me.”

“I do,” Sarah said, which was true in the limited way you liked someone who never made you feel unsafe. “But liking you isn’t the same thing as wanting this. And I don’t date to fill space.”

Another pause.

Then his voice softened—not tender, just tactical. “We can talk about it tonight.”

“No,” Sarah said, and the word came out like a door closing.

“Sarah—don’t be like that.”

She looked at the phone as if it had said something stupid.

“Like what?”

“Cold.”

Sarah’s brow lifted.

“Cold,” she repeated, tasting it. “Right. Sure.”

She could hear him breathing now, a little faster. The first crack in his confidence.

“I’m not cold,” she said. “I’m finished.”

He started talking again—too many words, too urgent, suddenly desperate to keep the thing he’d assumed would always be available.

Sarah didn’t let him get momentum.

She hung up.

Not dramatically. Not triumphantly.

Just… clean.

The silence that followed wasn’t empty like last night’s had been. It was spacious. It was relief.

Her phone buzzed almost immediately: a missed call. Then another. Then a text, then two.

Sarah put it face-down on the bedside table and went to make coffee.

Outside, a magpie warbled like it was gossiping about her.

She felt an unexpected little laugh rise in her throat.

He would cling for a bit.

Of course he would.

That was fine.

Clinging was not the same thing as being right.

And Sarah had finally remembered the difference.

*End Scene 39.*

She thumbed her contacts, found his name, and tapped.

It rang longer than it should have. Then sound flooded in—wind, men’s laughter, that hollow openness you only got outdoors when men were congratulating themselves for being outside.

“Hey,” he said, voice bright. Pleased with himself. “You alright?”

Sarah closed her eyes for a beat and let his tone finish the conversation for him.

“Yep,” she said. “I’m ending this.”

A pause. A genuine one. Like the words had reached his ears but couldn’t find a place to land.

“What?”

“I’m ending it,” Sarah repeated, calm on purpose. The calm was the point. “This. Whatever we were pretending it was.”

His laugh came out wrong—too quick, too defensive. “What, because of last night? Sarah—come on—”

Behind him, someone called his name, muffled by distance.

“Mate, you teeing off or what?”

He lowered his voice, as if privacy would make the sentence more reasonable. “Listen, you’re overthinking it. We’re good. We had fun. Don’t do this on the phone.”

Sarah looked at her bare feet on the carpet. The ordinary domesticity of the moment almost amused her. Almost.

“This is actually the perfect place to do it,” she said. “You’re with your mates. You’ll recover. Quickly.”

He exhaled hard. “This is insane.”

“No,” Sarah said softly. “What’s insane is you thinking you get to argue about it.”

She heard him moving—steps on grass, the shift of him putting distance between himself and the audience. Wind buffeted the mic. Somewhere behind him, a club clinked against something solid.

“Sarah, seriously—what do you *want* from me?” he demanded, like she was a faulty appliance he’d been patient with.

The question was so revealing she almost thanked him.

“Tenderness,” she said, and let the single word sit there between them like a dropped glass.

Silence.

Not thoughtful silence. Not *I hear you* silence.

Just… blank.

Then he did what men did when they were offered a feeling they couldn’t quantify.

He tried to bargain.

“I can be— I mean, I *am*—look, we can work on that.”

Sarah smiled without humour.

“That,” she said, “is the problem. It’s not a renovation project.”

A small sound—frustration, offence. The first hint that he’d expected her to be easier than this. “So you’re just… done?”

“Yes.”

“I thought you liked me.”

“I do,” Sarah said, because it was true in the limited way you liked someone who never made you feel unsafe. “But liking you isn’t the same thing as wanting this. And I don’t date to fill space.”

Another pause. A longer one. She could almost hear his brain searching for the correct lever.

Then his voice softened—tactical, not tender. “We can talk about it tonight.”

“No,” Sarah said, and the word landed like a door closing.

“Sarah—don’t be like that.”

She glanced at the phone as if it had said something stupid.

“Like what?”

“Cold.”

Sarah’s brow lifted.

“Cold,” she repeated, tasting it. “Right. Sure.”

She heard his breathing now, a little faster. The first crack in his confidence. Not remorse—just the unpleasant realisation that the thing he’d assumed would remain available was, in fact, capable of walking away.

“I’m not cold,” she said. “I’m finished.”

He started talking again—too many words, too urgent, suddenly desperate to keep what he’d never learned how to hold properly.

Sarah didn’t let him build momentum.

She hung up.

Not dramatically. Not triumphantly.

Just… clean.

The silence that followed wasn’t empty like last night’s had been. It was spacious. It was relief.

Her phone buzzed almost immediately: a missed call. Then another. Then a text, then two.

Sarah put it face-down on the bedside table and went to make coffee.

Outside, a magpie warbled like it was gossiping about her.

She felt an unexpected little laugh rise in her throat.

He would cling for a bit.

Of course he would.

That was fine.

Clinging was not the same thing as being right.

And Sarah had finally remembered the difference.

📱 The Golf Course Call 📱

**Scene 39 — “The Golf Course Call” (Sarah POV, past tense, 1st person)**

The morning light was mean.

It came in flat and bright through the blinds and made everything look too honest—discarded clothes, rumpled sheets, the empty space beside me like an accusation. I sat on the edge of the bed and drank water straight from the glass, as if hydration could fix the taste he’d left in the room.

My phone lay on the bedside table.

I stared at it.

It wasn’t rage that moved me. Rage is messy. Rage implies investment.

This was simpler.

This was the quiet certainty of realising I’d accepted something beneath my standards—and feeling, not shame, but irritation that I’d let it waste an evening of my life.

I thumbed my contacts, found his name, and tapped.

“Hey,” he said, voice bright. Pleased with himself. “You alright?”

I closed my eyes for a beat and let his tone tell me everything I needed to know.

“Yep,” I said. “I’m ending this.”

A pause. A genuine one. Like the words had reached his ears but couldn’t find a place to land.

“What?”

“I do,” I said, because it was true in the limited way you liked someone who never made you feel unsafe. “But liking you isn’t the same thing as wanting this. And I don’t date to fill space.”

I didn’t add: I’ve tried. It never works.

Another pause. A longer one. I could almost hear his brain searching for the correct lever.

Then his voice softened—tactical, not tender. “We can talk about it tonight.”

“No,” I said, and the word landed like a door closing.

If you want, I can also adjust one subtle thing that often strengthens 1st-person: swap a couple of “I heard / I looked” for **immediate sensory fragments** (keeps it inside her body even more). But this version is already properly Sarah-**I**, not omniscient. 💛

📱 The Golf Course Call 📱

**Scene 39 — “The Golf Course Call” (Sarah POV, past tense, 1st person)**

The morning light was mean.

It came in flat and bright through the blinds and turned everything blunt—discarded clothes, rumpled sheets, the empty space beside me like an accusation. I sat on the edge of the bed and drank last night's now-tepid water, as if hydration could fix the taste he’d left in the room. I was annoyed at him. I was more annoyed at myself.

My phone lay on the bedside table. I stared at it.

It wasn’t rage that moved me. Rage is messy. Rage implies investment. 

This was simpler: the quiet certainty of realising I’d accepted something beneath my standards—and feeling, not shame, but irritation that I’d let it waste even one evening of my life.

I thumbed my contacts, found his name, and tapped.

It rang longer than it should have. Then sound flooded in: wind, men’s laughter, that hollow openness you only got outdoors when men were congratulating themselves for being outside.

“Hey,” he said, voice bright. Pleased with himself. A pause. “You right?”

I closed my eyes for a beat.

“Yep,” I said. “I’m ending this.”

A pause, this time, his. Like the words had reached his ears but couldn’t find a place to land.

“Sorry, what?”

“I’m ending this,” I repeated, confidently calm. “Whatever we were pretending it was.”

His laugh came out wrong—quick, defensive. “Wait, what? Because of… why? Sarah, come on—”

Behind him, someone called his name, muffled by distance.

“Mate, you teeing off or what?”

He lowered his voice, as if privacy would make him sound more reasonable. “Listen, you’re overthinking things. We’re good. We have fun!” Another pause. “Look, don’t do this on the phone.”

I looked at my bare feet on the carpet. The ordinary domesticity of the moment almost amused me. Almost.

“No, this is actually the perfect place to do it,” I said. “You’re with your mates. You’ll recover. Quickly.”

“I’m not cold,” I said. “I’m finished.”

He spoke again. I didn’t listen for meaning. I listened for habit.

Then I hung up.

The quiet after was immediate, like a room after a door clicks shut.

My phone buzzed—missed call. Another.

I turned it over, face-down, and went to make coffee.

The magpie outside warbled, pleased with itself.

I smiled.

Done meant done.
