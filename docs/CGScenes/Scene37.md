**Scene 37 — “Sarah’s Eyes” (Sarah POV)**

Wardrobe in the morning is a lie you tell yourself in order to function.

You walk in and pretend it’s just work—just fabric, just scissors, just steam and chalk and numbers—and if you do it well enough, you can almost forget that the room is actually a living thing that keeps score.

I arrive on time because I’m not feral.

Also because arriving early in Wardrobe is a type of currency, and I’m not in the mood to spend mine when I don’t need to.

The room is already doing its morning inhale: kettle click, iron hiss, Mara’s presence like a weather front you can feel before you see it. Celeste is at the ledger, of course. She looks annoyingly composed, the way she always looks when she’s holding three plans in her head and refusing to let anyone smell it.

Then Charli comes in.

And I *know*.

Not because she’s wearing something dramatic—she isn’t. Not because she’s suddenly strutting—she’s not. It’s subtler than that, which is why it’s so obvious.

It’s in the way she enters the room as if she expects the floor to hold her.

It’s in the way she hangs her bag without that tiny flinch, the old reflex of “am I in the way?” It’s in the way she washes her hands like it’s a ritual, not a penance.

Most of all it’s in her face.

Not prettier. Not different in any cheap, male-gaze way.

Just… settled.

Like someone’s turned down the background alarm.

I perch on my stool with my coffee and watch her move.

Charli goes straight to the cap station, checks the tie tension without fuss, and adjusts the knot by a millimetre like she’s been doing it her whole life. No apology. No looking around for permission. No waiting for someone to tell her she’s doing it right.

She already knows the standard.

That’s the entire difference.

A girl who believes she belongs behaves like a girl who belongs. Revolutionary concept, honestly.

I flick my eyes over to Celeste.

Celeste is writing in the ledger. Her face is neutral. Her posture is “adult.” Her whole body is saying: *Nothing to see here, everyone, please return to your assigned competence.*

And yet.

There’s a softness in her attention that wasn’t there before. Not the kind you can accuse her of. Not the kind that would get her hauled into some HR nightmare.

It’s more like a gravitational shift.

Like she’s orienting herself around Charli without letting anyone hear the click.

That’s how you know it’s serious.

Celeste doesn’t do sloppy.

Mara barks an instruction. Lucy passes a pattern. Tahlia mutters something about seam allowance like it’s a religion. The room keeps moving.

Charli keeps moving with it.

And the glow—yes, glow, I’ll say it because I’m not afraid of the word—doesn’t look like excitement.

It looks like safety.

Which is when it hits me, with the kind of clarity that makes me slightly annoyed:

They’ve crossed the line.

Not the obvious one. Not the scandal one. The *real* line.

The line where it stops being “we’re keeping her safe” and becomes “we’re keeping each other.”

I sip my coffee and watch Celeste’s hands.

I’ve watched those hands do brutal kindness. I’ve watched her set standards that make men wilt and women straighten. I’ve watched her make decisions that hold the room together without asking anyone’s permission.

If she’s chosen Charli, it won’t be accidental.

It also won’t be messy.

Which means I have only one question, really.

Is it clean?

I wait for the tell.

It comes a few minutes later, almost nothing: Charli passes close to Celeste’s table, pauses half a beat, and says softly, “Morning.”

Celeste doesn’t look up right away.

She finishes writing first.

Then she looks up, meets Charli’s eyes for exactly the length of time that is *appropriate*, and says, “Morning.”

No lingering. No smile that could be called indulgent. No warmth used like candy.

But Charli’s face changes—just a fraction—as if that single, controlled acknowledgement has landed somewhere deep and stabilising.

Charli moves on.

Celeste returns to the ledger.

And I understand, with reluctant admiration: yes.

Clean.

Off the clock, on the clock, it stays separate. Whatever they’re building, it isn’t being built on Charli’s neediness or Celeste’s power.

It’s being built on structure.

On consent.

On rules.

Which, in this room, is the closest thing we have to romance anyway.

I hop down from my stool and drift over to the ledger table because I’m me, and because if I don’t say something, my tongue will rot.

I lean an elbow on the edge—casual, but not careless. Mara would murder me if I left a coffee ring.

Celeste doesn’t look up.

“Interesting morning,” I say lightly.

Celeste’s pen continues moving. “Is it.”

“Yes,” I say. “You’re doing that thing where you pretend the room isn’t a room.”

That earns me a glance. Cool. Patient. Slightly murderous.

“Sarah,” she says, like a warning.

I hold up a hand. “Relax. I’m not asking for details.”

Celeste’s eyes narrow. “Good.”

I take a sip of coffee like I’ve got all day.

I lower my voice, because I’m not a monster.

“She looks good,” I say. “Properly good.”

Celeste’s pen pauses for the smallest moment.

Then resumes.

“Yes,” she says, flat.

I tilt my head. “And you?”

Celeste finally looks up fully.

Her face is calm. Too calm.

“Me,” she says, “am doing my job.”

I hum. “Mm. And your job is… what? Keeping distance forever? Or keeping it safe?”

Celeste’s gaze holds mine.

It’s not defensive.

It’s… sharp. Considered.

“Keeping it safe,” she says.

There it is.

No confession. No romance novel nonsense.

Just a woman stating her intention like a policy.

It should be cold.

It isn’t.

It’s devotion expressed in the only language Celeste trusts: responsibility.

I nod once.

“Good,” I say. “Because if you hurt her—”

“I won’t,” Celeste cuts in.

Not angry. Not dramatic.

Certain.

And I believe her.

Because I’ve watched her build a whole room out of certainty.

I let the threat dissolve into something more useful.

“I’m not worried you’ll hurt her,” I say, honest now. “I’m worried you’ll forget you’re allowed to want her.”

Celeste’s expression flickers—annoyance, maybe. Or recognition.

“Go back to your work, Sarah,” she says, and it’s the closest thing to tenderness she’s ever offered me.

I grin. “Gladly.”

I start to turn away, then pause.

“One more thing,” I add, softer.

Celeste sighs like she’s suffering.

I keep my eyes on the room, not on her.

“If she’s glowing,” I say, “it’s because she finally believes us.”

Celeste’s voice comes quiet, almost to herself.

“I know.”

I walk back to my stool and sit down.

Charli is at the table now, pinning cleanly, speaking easily to Bree, laughing without snatching the laugh back. She looks like a girl who has stopped waiting for the trap.

And Celeste—Celeste sits at the ledger with her spine straight and her face calm, doing her best impression of a woman who has everything under control.

Which, frankly, is adorable.

Because I can see the truth anyway.

The room has shifted.

The story has shifted.

And I, Sarah of the sharp tongue and the excellent instincts, will be damned if I don’t keep one eye on it—not to interfere, not to gossip, but to make sure the rules stay what they are:

No hooks.

No spectacle.

No men’s ideas of romance.

Just two women doing the only thing that matters.

Keeping it clean.

Keeping her safe.

And letting love grow the way it should:

Quietly.

Deliberately.

Like a seam you don’t notice until you realise the whole garment finally fits.

## **Scene 38 — “Weaponised Helplessness” (Sarah POV)**

There are men who are genuinely incompetent.

And then there are men who are competent enough to *choose* incompetence, because it’s such an efficient way to outsource their lives.

Ethan—of course his name is Ethan—falls firmly into the second category.

I realise it on a Tuesday, which is rude. Tuesday is supposed to be neutral. Tuesday is supposed to be emails and decent coffee and fabric that behaves.

Instead, I’m standing in his kitchen watching him hold a saucepan like it’s a live animal.

“I don’t really… cook,” he says, as if that’s a personality trait, not a survival skill.

The fridge behind him is full of things that aren’t meals. Milk. Eggs. Sauce bottles. A container labelled *Mum’s lasagne* in handwriting so obviously not his that I almost laugh.

“You live alone,” I say.

He grins. “Yeah, but Mum—”

“—does it,” I finish for him.

He blinks. “She likes helping.”

Ah. That familiar line. The one that translates as: *I’ve trained a woman into my domestic life and I’m looking for a replacement model.*

There are other tells.

The way he hands me a plate to wash without asking, like my hands are a service he’s entitled to activate.

The way he says “I’m terrible at laundry” like it’s cute.

The way he brings up moving in together after six weeks, and it’s not because he loves me. It’s because he’s spotted an upgrade path: from Mum to Girlfriend Mum.

At one point he looks genuinely confused that I’m not charmed.

“You’re really organised,” he says. “I like that about you.”

I stare at him.

That’s not a compliment. That’s a job description.

I go home and lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, and I feel something in my chest settle into a hard, clean shape.

I am over him.

Not “thinking about being over him.”

Over him. Done.

So the next day, I do it properly.

I call him. Not text. Not a long message he can forward to his mates for sport.

A call. Clear. Brief. Unambiguous.

“Hi,” I say, and keep my voice neutral. “This isn’t working for me. I’m ending it. I’m not interested in continuing, and I’m not changing my mind.”

There’s a pause on the line where he tries to find the angle.

“Is this about that kitchen thing?” he asks, laughing slightly, like it’s banter.

“It’s about compatibility,” I say. “We’re not compatible.”

Another pause.

Then the tone shifts.

“Oh,” he says, slowly. “So what, you’re just… dumping me.”

“Yes,” I say, because men love euphemisms when they’re losing. “I am.”

He exhales sharply, offended. “Right. Okay. Wow. I didn’t think you were like that.”

I blink.

Like what? A woman with a spine?

“I’m being clear,” I say.

He tries a new tactic. Softness. “Sarah, come on. I just need you to tell me what I did wrong.”

“I’m not your coach,” I say, calm as a surgeon. “Goodbye, Ethan.”

And I end the call.

I don’t block him immediately.

That’s not optimism. That’s evidence-gathering.

It’s not my first rodeo.

---

At Wardrobe, I don’t announce any of this. I don’t want a round of sympathy from women who could weaponise empathy with a single raised eyebrow.

I do, however, allow myself one confession: to Bree, because Bree can make anything bearable by laughing at it without minimising it.

She’s at the big table sorting a bag of pins like they’ve personally offended her.

“How’s Mr. Tuesday?” she asks without looking up.

I drop my tote on the floor and exhale.

“He’s been returned to sender.”

Bree looks up, delighted. “Ooh. That bad?”

“He doesn’t cook,” I say.

Bree’s eyebrows lift. “Like… doesn’t cook as in doesn’t enjoy it? Or doesn’t cook as in would starve without a woman?”

“As in,” I say, “his fridge contains *Mum’s lasagne* and a faith-based relationship with Uber Eats.”

Bree snorts. “Oh no.”

“Oh yes,” I say. “And he’s got that thing. That *thing* where he looks at you like you’re a solution to his life.”

Bree winces. “Replacement mum.”

“Replacement mum,” I confirm. “Like I’ve got ‘domestic manager’ stamped on my forehead.”

Bree taps the pin tray once. “I’d rather chew glass.”

“Exactly.”

Charli is nearby, at the cap table, adjusting ties with that new calm she wears like it belongs to her. She’s listening without looking like she’s listening, which is a skill women develop early.

Bree, with perfect timing, says, “Honestly, babe. Women are just… better.”

She says it jokingly—mostly. Bree always says jokes like she means them and means things like they’re jokes.

I roll my eyes. “Oh, here we go.”

Charli, without looking up, drops in with a deadpan that makes me choke on my own air.

“I’m a fan.”

Bree *howls*, delighted. Tahlia makes a choking noise behind a sleeve. Even Lucy’s mouth twitches as if her face is briefly considering humour before rejecting it on principle.

I glare at them all, purely for show.

“Oh, shut up,” I say. “All of you.”

Charli smiles—real, unguarded—and goes back to tying her knot like she hasn’t just thrown a grenade of charm into my morning.

It’s infuriating how likeable she’s become.

Bree wipes her eyes. “So,” she says, recovering. “He took it well?”

“He took it like a man who’s never been told no without being offered a biscuit afterwards,” I say.

Bree’s expression shifts—still amused, but alert. “Meaning?”

“Meaning he tried sad,” I say. “Then tried offended. Then tried making it my fault.”

Bree points a pin at me. “And you?”

“I was clear,” I say. “No explanation. No negotiation.”

Bree’s approving nod is small but fierce. “Good girl.”

I give her a look.

Bree grins. “Sorry. Bad habit.”

“Mm.”

I should stop there. Wrap it up. Move on.

But my phone buzzes in my pocket like a warning.

I pull it out.

A message from Ethan.

> **Ethan:** Wow. Okay. So that’s it? After everything?
> **Ethan:** I’m outside. We need to talk.

I go very still.

Bree’s smile fades when she sees my face.

“He’s not,” Bree says quietly. “He’s not outside here.”

I look toward the front windows. Nothing. No man at the gate. No shape lingering.

“No,” I say. “Not here.”

Charli’s head lifts slightly. Not panicked. Just attentive. The room’s temperature changes by half a degree—women becoming aware.

I keep my voice calm because I refuse to bring chaos into Wardrobe.

“He’s at my place,” I say.

Bree’s mouth tightens. “Do you want me to call someone?”

“No,” I say. “Not yet.”

I take one breath. Then I do what Mara would do.

I handle it clean.

I type one message back. No emotion. No opening. No softness he can grab.

> **Me:** Do not come to my home. Do not wait for me. Do not contact me again.
> **Me:** If you come near me or my work, I will treat it as harassment and I will act accordingly.

I hit send.

Then, because I’m not daft, I screenshot it.

I create a folder.

**Ethan — dates**

It’s grim how quickly that feels normal.

Bree watches me do it and nods once, approval like a stamp.

Charli’s eyes stay on my face for a beat—quietly concerned, quietly present—then she drops her gaze back to her work, giving me privacy without withdrawing support.

That’s Wardrobe culture in action: *you are not alone, but you are not made into a spectacle.*

The kettle clicks. The iron hisses. Mara’s shears bite through fabric.

Life continues.

My phone buzzes again.

I don’t look at it immediately.

I finish what my hands are doing first, because control is sometimes as simple as choosing the order of actions.

Then I pick it up.

Another message.

> **Ethan:** You can’t do this to me.
> **Ethan:** I just want to talk. Stop being dramatic.

I stare at the words for a moment, feeling something cold and familiar settle in my ribs.

There it is.

The entitlement, plain as daylight.

*Access* framed as *need.*
My boundary framed as *drama.*

Bree’s voice is low. “Sarah.”

“I know,” I say.

I don’t reply.

Not now.

Because the next reply will be the kind that changes the game. The kind that invites escalation if you do it wrong.

I slide my phone back into my pocket and lift my chin.

“Work,” I say, mostly to myself.

Bree’s grin returns—smaller, harder. “Work,” she echoes.

And Charli, from the cap table, says quietly, almost under her breath:

“You won’t get used to that.”

I glance at her.

She meets my eyes with a calm that isn’t pity and isn’t fear.

Just truth.

I exhale once, slow.

“No,” I agree. “I won’t.”

And I go back to the table, letting the room hold steady around me, while somewhere outside of it a man realises—too late—that I am not his mother, and I am not his solution.

I am his boundary.





















## **Scene 39 — “Pear-Shaped” (Sarah POV)**

It’s amazing how quickly a man can turn your boundary into his *personal tragedy*.

It’s also amazing how many of them genuinely believe that if they feel bad enough, the world will be obligated to comfort them.

Ethan doesn’t reply for an hour.

Which should have been a gift.

Instead it’s the quiet before the weather front.

By lunch I’ve had three missed calls.

By mid-afternoon he’s discovered email.

By four, there’s a notification from my building manager.

**Someone is downstairs asking for you. Says it’s urgent.**

I don’t even need to ask who.

My stomach doesn’t drop anymore. It goes cold. Efficient. Clinical.

I don’t leave my station. I don’t bolt. I don’t make it theatre.

I walk to Lauren’s corner of the room—because Lauren is the adult in the civilian world the way Mara is the adult in fabric—and I keep my voice low.

“He’s at my building,” I say.

Lauren’s face changes. Not into panic. Into calculation.

“Do you feel unsafe right now?” she asks.

“No,” I say. “But he’s escalating.”

Lauren nods once. “Okay. You’re not going home alone.”

“I’m not going home at all,” I say.

Lauren’s eyes flick to Mara, then back to me, as if checking what kind of support this room is allowed to give without turning into a rescue fantasy.

“Bree,” Lauren calls, matter-of-fact. Not loud. Just… inevitable.

Bree appears instantly, like she was waiting.

Lauren’s voice stays calm. “Sarah’s got a boundary issue. You’re her buddy for the rest of the shift. She doesn’t walk to her car alone. She doesn’t go anywhere alone. Clear?”

Bree’s grin is gone now. “Clear.”

Mara doesn’t look up. She taps her pen once against the ledger—tick, tick—as if she’s underlining Lauren’s sentence in her own language: **standards.**

Charli is at the cap table, and I feel her attention land on me like a soft hand. She doesn’t come over. She doesn’t insert herself.

She just… holds the room steady by existing in it.

Which is a strange kind of comfort.

I text the building manager back.

**Do not let him up. Tell him to leave. If he refuses, call police.**

Then I screenshot that too.

Evidence-gathering. Boring. Miraculous.

An hour later, another message comes in—this time from Ethan, of course.

> **Ethan:** You’re being insane.
> **Ethan:** I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
> **Ethan:** Don’t make me do something stupid.

There it is.

The classic line that tries to turn his behaviour into *my* responsibility.

My hands don’t shake. That’s the gift of being furious.

I show Lauren the screen.

Lauren’s jaw tightens, and she says, very quietly, “Nope.”

Not “oh no.”

Not “are you okay?”

Just: **nope.**

The word of a woman who has seen this move before and has zero intention of playing.

“Right,” she says. “We go formal.”

I blink. “Already?”

Lauren’s gaze is steady. “Sarah, he’s using implied threat language and turning up at your home. That’s already formal.”

I exhale slowly, because she’s right, and because I hate being right about men.

Lauren pulls her phone out, taps once, twice.

“Leave it with me,” she says. “You keep screenshots. Dates. Times. Don’t reply. Don’t explain. Don’t negotiate.”

It’s such a Lauren sentence: a list that becomes a lifeline.

Bree leans in beside me. “I’ll stay at yours tonight,” she says, like it’s nothing, like she’s offering to water a plant. “Or you stay at mine. Dealer’s choice.”

I look at her, touched in a way that is infuriating.

“I’m fine,” I say automatically.

Bree raises an eyebrow. “You’re not fine, babe. You’re just competent.”

Fair.

---

By the time the shift ends, I have a plan.

Not a dramatic plan.

A boring plan.

Lauren drives, Bree in the passenger seat, me in the back like a teenager being escorted home after a questionable party.

It’s humiliating.

Which means it’s good for me.

We don’t go to my building. We don’t reward his persistence with my presence. We go to Bree’s place first, because Bree has the kind of tiny apartment where a man would look ridiculous standing outside.

Lauren calls my building manager while we’re parked.

Her tone is polite enough to pass, steel enough to cut glass.

“Yes, thank you… no, I understand… please document that in your log… yes, call immediately if he returns… yes, we will be taking further steps.”

She ends the call and looks at me.

“He left,” she says. “But he’ll come back. So we close the loop.”

I swallow. “What loop.”

“The one where he thinks access is negotiable,” Lauren says.

We spend the next hour doing paperwork in the most unromantic way possible: names, times, screenshots, a short statement that says exactly what happened and nothing more.

Lauren doesn’t embellish. She doesn’t plead. She doesn’t tell a story.

She gives facts.

It’s terrifying how effective facts are when a woman uses them like a blade.

By the end of the night, I have an interim safety plan, a number to call, and a list of instructions so dull they could be a laundry guide.

Bree makes tea. Not to soothe. To keep us upright.

When Lauren finally stands to leave, she pauses at the door.

“Sarah,” she says, and her voice softens just a notch. “This isn’t your fault.”

I roll my eyes because I need to.

“I know.”

Lauren’s gaze doesn’t let me wriggle away.

“No,” she repeats gently. “*Really* know.”

I look away. Then back.

“I know,” I say again, and this time I mean it.

Lauren nods once, satisfied.

“I’ll check on you tomorrow,” she says. “And if he appears at Wardrobe, Mara will eat him alive.”

“Delicately,” Bree adds.

Lauren’s mouth twitches. “With a fork.”

She leaves.

Bree locks the door behind her, then looks at me with something like a sister’s appraisal.

“You want to go out tomorrow night?” she asks. “Just… shake it off?”

I huff. “You think I need shaking off.”

Bree points at me. “You need reminding that your life doesn’t belong to some man who can’t boil pasta.”

I hate that she’s right.

So I say, “Fine.”

---

The next night, I dress like myself.

Not sexy. Not soft. Not “approachable.”

I put on black jeans and boots and a top that says: **I know where my keys are**.

We go to a place Bree likes—music, crowd, women who laugh like they own their lungs.

For the first hour, it works.

I loosen. I laugh. I even forget to look at the door.

Then a man slides into our orbit like smoke.

He’s not Ethan. He’s the *same type*, just with better hair.

He talks to Bree as if I’m invisible, then talks to me as if I’m a resource. He’s charming in the way men are charming when they’re used to women smoothing the awkward parts for them.

I can feel myself tensing—old instincts waking up.

Bree clocks it and leans into my ear.

“Want me to bite him?” she whispers.

“I want you to set him on fire,” I mutter.

Bree snorts.

I decide to handle it like an adult.

I say, clear and calm, “We’re not interested.”

He smiles as if I’ve flirted.

“Aw, come on,” he says. “Don’t be like that.”

I feel the rage flicker—cold, familiar.

“Like what,” I say, sweetly. “A woman who said no?”

His smile tightens.

“Oh,” he says. “You’re one of those.”

Bree’s eyes flash. “And you’re one of *those*,” she replies, bright as a knife.

He laughs like we’re entertainment. He reaches for my elbow.

My whole body goes still.

Not fear.

History.

I step back.

“Don’t touch me,” I say.

He lifts both hands in mock surrender.

“Relax.”

Bree’s hand is suddenly on my back, steady.

“We’re leaving,” she says.

And we do.

We walk out into the night air, and it’s like walking from heat into cold water.

My hands are shaking now.

Bree looks at me. “You okay?”

I open my mouth to say yes.

Instead I say, “I’m furious.”

Bree nods, satisfied. “Good. Fury’s honest.”

We should go home.

We don’t.

Because I’m stubborn, and because part of me wants to prove I’m not a woman who has to retreat.

So when Bree suggests a quieter bar two streets over, I say yes.

And there—there is where I make my mistake.

I drink too fast.

Not because I’m trying to get drunk.

Because my nervous system is trying to come down and I’m sick of being vigilant.

One drink becomes two. Two becomes three.

My body softens before my mind is ready for it.

And then my phone buzzes.

A blocked number.

My stomach clenches.

Another buzz.

Another.

Bree’s face tightens when she sees mine.

“It’s him,” I say.

Bree grabs my hand. “We’re going. Now.”

But the street tilts a little when I stand. Not dramatic. Just enough.

Bree swears softly. “Okay. Okay. We’re fine. We get a rideshare—”

My brain does a quick, ugly calculation: my address, my building, Ethan’s persistence, the risk of being dropped at the wrong place, the risk of fumbling keys.

I do the only competent thing left.

I call the most competent woman I know who will not ask questions first.

Lauren.

She answers on the second ring.

“Sarah?”

My voice comes out too careful.

“Lauren,” I say. “I need you.”

There’s no sigh. No judgement. No lecture.

Just immediate clarity.

“Where are you?” she asks.

I tell her.

“Stay where you are,” she says. “With Bree?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I’m coming.”

I blink hard, suddenly close to tears, which is ridiculous.

“Thank you,” I manage.

Lauren’s voice stays firm.

“No thanks,” she says. “Just sit down and wait. I’ll be there.”

The line clicks off.

Bree wraps an arm around my shoulders, guiding me to a bench like I weigh nothing.

“You did good,” she says.

I laugh once, sharp and humourless.

“I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grins. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

I close my eyes for a second and breathe in the night.

And in the small, humiliating quiet of needing help, something in me loosens—something stubborn and old.

Maybe competence isn’t never needing anyone.

Maybe it’s knowing exactly which woman to call when the world goes pear-shaped.

---

If you’d like, the next scene can be **Lauren POV** arriving: brisk, protective, *no drama*, and she quietly clocks the deeper pattern (male entitlement, Sarah’s exhaustion, the way women keep having to do paperwork to be left alone). Then we can pivot back toward Wardrobe the next morning where Mara gets the one-sentence update and simply says: “Good. Now you’re done with him.” 💛

















## **Scene 40 — “No Questions First” (Lauren POV)**

When Sarah rings you at night, you answer.

Not because she’s fragile—Sarah is many things, but fragile isn’t one of them.

You answer because women who don’t ask for help until they *have* to are the ones who end up in trouble when they finally do.

I was in the kitchen when the call came in, rinsing a mug and thinking about nothing in particular. The sound of my phone was ordinary.

The reason for it wasn’t.

“Lauren?” Sarah’s voice was careful—too careful. Tight at the edges. Like she was trying to keep her pride from spilling into the call.

“Sarah,” I said. “Where are you?”

There was a pause, a swallow. “Near—” she named a street. A venue. A landmark. Bree’s name followed like a relief valve. “Bree’s with me.”

Good. One woman, at least.

“Stay where you are,” I said. “Sit down. Don’t go anywhere alone. I’m coming.”

“Thank you,” she said, as if she hated the words.

“No thanks,” I replied. “Just wait.”

I hung up, grabbed my keys, and sent one text to Celeste.

**Going to pick up Sarah + Bree. Will update.**

No explanation. Celeste didn’t need a story. She needed the fact.

On the way out I glanced at Charli’s shoes by the door—neatly placed, toes aligned—and felt the small, familiar pinch in my chest that came with seeing my child’s life overlapping someone else’s home.

Not my home. Not quite yet.

But safe enough.

That was the point.

I drove through the city with my jaw set and my hands steady on the wheel. Not because I was calm. Because I had practice. Motherhood trains you to turn panic into logistics.

I thought, briefly, of the folder on my phone—screenshots, dates, times. The unromantic evidence of a woman being asked to manage a man’s feelings.

I didn’t need the details to know the shape of it.

You could tell the shape from the call alone.

*Help, but don’t make me beg.*

When I pulled up, I spotted them immediately.

Bree on a bench, arm around Sarah’s shoulders, posture angled outward like a shield. Sarah sitting upright, chin lifted, eyes too bright in the streetlight. She looked… competent and unwell at the same time, which is a particular kind of danger.

I parked, got out, and walked over without running. If I ran, it became drama. If it became drama, Sarah would recoil.

“Hi,” I said, as if this were nothing more than a late pick-up from the airport.

Bree stood first. “Hey,” she replied, brisk and grateful. “She’s okay. Just… overloaded.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, assessing. Expecting judgement. Expecting *mum voice.*

She got something else.

“Okay,” I said. “Let’s get you home.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened. “I can—”

“No,” I said, not unkind. “You can’t. Not tonight. Not safely.”

The word safely wasn’t a reprimand. It was a standard. Something you either met or you didn’t.

Sarah swallowed. Then she nodded once, small.

Bree opened the back door. Sarah moved toward it, but her steps weren’t as precise as her pride wanted them to be. Bree steadied her without fuss.

I waited until Sarah was seated before I spoke again.

“Seatbelt,” I said, calm.

Sarah clicked it, cheeks flushing.

Bree slid into the front passenger seat. I got in, shut the door, and took a breath.

Only then did I ask the first question.

“Is he contacting you right now?” I asked, keeping my eyes on the road as I pulled away.

Sarah’s laugh was dry. “That’s your first question.”

“Yes,” I said. “Because that’s the only one that matters this minute.”

Bree angled her phone toward me. “Blocked calls,” she said. “A few.”

I nodded once, already making a mental list.

“Good,” I said. “We’ll document. You don’t answer.”

Sarah leaned her head back against the seat, eyes closed for a moment. “I didn’t,” she muttered. “I didn’t answer.”

“I know,” I said. “You called me.”

That, apparently, was the right thing to say, because Sarah’s throat moved and she didn’t speak for a few seconds.

Bree glanced at her, then looked forward again, jaw tight.

“He’s not Ethan,” Bree said. “Tonight was… a different one.”

I felt my stomach go cold.

“Different one,” I repeated, keeping my voice steady.

Bree nodded. “Some bloke. Grabby. The usual. We left.”

Sarah spoke then, voice low. “I said no. He acted like I’d flirted.”

Of course he did.

I kept my eyes on the road. There were two things I could do right now: give empathy, or give stability.

Sarah needed stability.

“Okay,” I said. “So: two problems. One, the ex. Two, the world.”

Bree barked a laugh. Sarah’s mouth twitched, almost despite herself.

“Lucky me,” Sarah muttered.

“Not luck,” I said, and let the steel in my voice come through. “Patterns. We deal with patterns.”

I pulled up at Bree’s building, because that’s where Sarah needed to be tonight: somewhere she wouldn’t feel hunted, somewhere she wouldn’t have to walk from car to door alone while her brain did ugly arithmetic.

Bree got out first, opened Sarah’s door, offered an arm.

Sarah hesitated, pride flaring.

I cut it off clean.

“Sarah,” I said, quiet. “Don’t be brave at the wrong time.”

She stared at me for a beat. Then, grudgingly, she took Bree’s arm and stepped out.

Inside, Bree’s place was small and warm—women’s clutter, shoes kicked off, a throw blanket draped like an afterthought. Bree guided Sarah to the couch and handed her a glass of water with the calm authority of someone who has done triage.

I sat opposite them and opened my phone.

“All right,” I said. “We do boring now.”

Sarah squinted. “Boring.”

“Yes,” I replied. “Screenshots. Dates. Times. Building manager log. One clean statement. No essays.”

Bree hovered behind the couch, arms folded. “I love you,” she told me, deadpan.

Sarah groaned. “Please don’t.”

I ignored both of them and held my phone out.

“Sarah,” I said. “Send me the message thread.”

Sarah stiffened. “Why?”

“Because if you’re rattled,” I said evenly, “you might answer by accident. Or delete something out of shame. Or forget a detail you’ll need later. I’m not letting your nervous system do admin.”

Sarah stared at me, then exhaled sharply.

“Fine,” she muttered. “God.”

“Thank you,” I replied, and waited.

Sarah unlocked her phone, scrolled, and began forwarding screenshots. Each one landed in my messages like a pebble in a jar—small, ordinary, cumulative.

Ethan’s language was exactly what I expected.

You can’t do this to me.
Stop being dramatic.
I just need to talk.
I’m outside.

None of it technically violent.

All of it coercive.

A man trying to turn “no” into “not yet.”

I felt my mouth go tight.

I made a folder.

**Sarah — Ethan — Jan**

Then another:

**Venue incident — notes**

Not because I wanted to build a case tonight.

Because I wanted Sarah to know—without me saying it—that this wasn’t chaos.

It was manageable.

Sarah watched my hands moving with a kind of exhausted relief that made my chest ache. She didn’t want to be mothered.

She wanted the world to be structured again.

Bree crouched beside her on the couch and spoke softly.

“You did the right thing calling Lauren,” Bree said.

Sarah snorted. “I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grinned. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

Sarah’s laugh cracked into something almost real. Then she rubbed her face with both hands, sudden vulnerability slipping through.

“I’m so tired,” she said, and the words were barely audible.

I didn’t soften into pity. Pity makes women smaller. Sarah would rather crawl out of her skin.

So I gave her something else.

A plan.

“Okay,” I said. “Tonight: you sleep here. Bree stays with you. Phone on Do Not Disturb. If he calls, you do nothing. If he shows up, you do not engage. You call police. Period.”

Sarah’s eyes flashed. “That’s dramatic.”

“It’s not dramatic,” I said. “It’s procedure.”

The word procedure landed like a handrail. Sarah’s shoulders lowered by a fraction.

“Tomorrow,” I continued, “we update your building manager. We confirm he’s not allowed entry. We take your documentation and we file what needs filing. And if he appears at Wardrobe, you do not handle it alone.”

Sarah blinked. “He wouldn’t—”

“He might,” I said. “Men like this confuse public space with entitlement space. We don’t assume good behaviour.”

Bree nodded sharply. “Mara will eat him.”

“With a fork,” I said.

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. Then, finally, her voice went small—rare for her.

“Okay,” she said.

Not “fine.”

Not “whatever.”

Okay.

I stood.

“I’ll check on you in the morning,” I said. “And Sarah?”

She looked up.

I held her gaze and made the sentence as plain as a ledger entry.

“This isn’t your fault.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened, reflexively allergic to comfort.

“I know,” she said.

I didn’t let it slide.

“No,” I repeated, quiet and firm. “Really know.”

Something in her face shifted—anger, grief, exhaustion—then settled.

“I know,” she said again, and this time it sounded like she was trying to believe it.

“Good,” I said. “Because you’re not going to carry his behaviour like it’s your responsibility.”

Sarah swallowed. She nodded once.

Bree reached for her hand and squeezed it.

I left them there—two women on a couch, one holding, one being held—because that was the whole point of the network.

Not rescue.

Not melodrama.

Just women refusing to let another woman be alone in a moment that could have tipped her into danger.

On the drive home, my phone buzzed once.

A text from Celeste.

**All okay?**

I replied without stopping at a red light, because some things mattered more than traffic etiquette.

**Sarah safe. Bree with her. Ex escalating; we’re going formal. Will brief Mara tomorrow.**

I put the phone down.

The streetlights slid past.

And I felt, with a strange, steady clarity, the way all of this rhymed.

Charli. Sarah. Bree. Celeste. Mara.

Different stories, same pattern: women tightening the net under one another, quietly, methodically, refusing to let male entitlement be the unchallenged weather of their lives.

Tomorrow, we’d do the boring things again.

Paperwork. Logs. Rules.

The unglamorous machinery of women making the world safe enough to live in.

And I would do it without apology.
