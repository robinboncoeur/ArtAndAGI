**Scene 41 — “Radiant” (Sarah POV)**

Wardrobe gets a particular kind of busy when the Faire women come in.

It’s not the everyday rhythm—steam and pins and Mara’s shears making their soft, confident threats. It’s something more theatrical: colour arriving, laughter arriving, the faint perfume of other lives. Actresses bring a kind of light with them. Not always pleasant, but undeniable.

They came in after lunch, a cluster of them, skirts and tote bags and big opinions. The room tightened into competence automatically: stations ready, fittings scheduled, tape measures uncoiled like quiet authority.

I was on my stool with a coffee, watching the threshold the way I always did—half habit, half sport—when Bree walked in with someone on her arm.

Not literally. Bree’s not a Victorian gentleman. But the posture was the same: the subtle lean toward, the easy angle of her shoulder, the way her body said *this person belongs with me* without needing to announce it.

Lily.

I’d seen Lily before. Everyone had. Lily was one of those women who made a room adjust itself—hair like a promise, laugh like she’d never once asked permission to take up space. She’d always been charming in a way that made me roll my eyes because I don’t trust charming.

But today she wasn’t performing.

Today she was… *lit.*

She walked in beside Bree and the two of them had that private, bright current running between them—little glances, tiny touches, the kind of unforced coordination you only get when two people have stopped negotiating whether they’re allowed to want each other.

Bree’s grin was wide and unashamed.

Lily’s hand brushed Bree’s wrist as they crossed the room, not coy, not possessive. Just… natural. Like reaching for warmth.

And it hit me—harder than I expected—that they looked happy.

Not “posting online” happy.

Not “prove something” happy.

Happy like a body that has stopped bracing.

I watched them as they moved toward the fitting area. Bree said something under her breath and Lily laughed—real laughter, head tipping back, eyes closing for half a beat. Bree’s face softened in response, like her whole nervous system had learned the shape of that sound.

I felt a strange, unwelcome thought rise up in me:

*That looks… nice.*

Then another one, even worse, because it arrived with zero moral framing and no permission slip from my brain:

*And she’s beautiful.*

I didn’t mean it as competition. I didn’t mean it as envy. I meant it as a fact my eyes observed, the way my eyes observe fabric quality.

Lily was objectively gorgeous.

But that wasn’t what made my stomach tilt.

It was the way Bree looked at her like she was the only thing in the room worth orienting toward.

Bree — who could be loud, chaotic, generous, irritating, wonderful — looked *quietly devoted.*

It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t a phase. It wasn’t a “girls being silly” interlude before returning to a man-shaped life.

It was… real.

I swallowed and made myself take a sip of coffee, because I needed my hands to do something that wasn’t betraying me.

Lily spotted Charli at the cap table and waved.

“Oh my god,” she called, delighted. “Look at you! You’re… you’re so *proper* now.”

Charli flushed, smiling in that bashful way she still had even with all her new steadiness.

“Hi,” Charli said, and didn’t apologise for the attention. Didn’t duck. Didn’t shrink.

She took the compliment like a girl who had learned she didn’t have to throw gifts back into people’s faces for safety.

Celeste glanced up from the ledger, calm as ever, and nodded once at Lily—polite, controlled, adult.

Then her gaze flicked to Charli for half a beat, and I caught it: the softness she tried so hard to hide.

Wardrobe saw everything. Even when people pretended it didn’t.

Mara clapped her hands once—sharp, decisive.

“Right,” she said. “You. Fitting room. You. Table. Stop talking and start standing still.”

The actresses laughed and obeyed, because Mara was the closest thing this room had to gravity.

Lily stepped closer to Bree and said, low but not private enough for my sharp ears not to catch it:

“You’re coming over tonight, yeah?”

Bree’s grin went lazy and warm. “Obviously.”

No apology. No awkwardness. No “if you want.” No “unless you’re busy.” No negotiation.

Just yes.

And in my chest, something shifted.

Not jealousy.

Not longing, not yet.

Something more uncomfortable:

recognition.

A kind of internal data point landing with a quiet thud: *that’s what it looks like when the wanting isn’t a problem.*

When the wanting isn’t shameful.

When the wanting doesn’t turn you into someone’s domestic function.

When it’s just… two women, deciding.

I sat there on my stool, coffee cooling, and watched Bree and Lily disappear into the fitting area together—Bree stepping aside to hold the curtain, Lily’s hand brushing her shoulder as she passed—and I realised, with faint annoyance, that I’d been holding my breath.

I let it out slowly.

Then I did what I always did when something hit too close:

I made it a joke in my own head.

*Well,* I thought, dryly, *that’s inconvenient.*

Because once you’ve seen a kind of happiness up close—real, radiant, unforced—it becomes very difficult to pretend you don’t know what you’re missing.

Yes — this is *very* plausible, and it neatly solves the “all men are jerks” flattening without backing away from your theme (male entitlement as ambient weather, not every individual bloke as a cartoon villain) 💛🧵

What I love about your new shape is that it gives Sarah a **clean comparative experiment**:

* She sees **women-love-women happiness** up close (Bree + Lily), and it lands in her body before it lands in her brain.
* She then meets a **genuinely decent man** (Carl) who behaves well — and the story shows that decency isn’t the issue. Attraction is.
* The painful honesty of ending it (and her guilt) pushes her into a familiar coping mechanism (drink), which sets up the spiking incident without moralising: it’s not “Sarah is irresponsible,” it’s “Sarah is tired and lonely and misreading her own needs.”
* Lauren as the rescuer the second time becomes the hinge: the morning after, Sarah realises the truth isn’t “Lauren is safe,” it’s “Lauren is *wanted*.”

That is a *gorgeous* pivot into romance that doesn’t require any man-bashing. Carl can even become a quiet proof-point: **men can be kind; Sarah still wants women.**

### A tiny craft caution (so it doesn’t feel contrived)

The “spiked drink” beat will land best if you make it **uncertain and sensory** rather than declarative:

* Sarah feels an abrupt, wrong shift: dizziness too fast for her intake, nausea, heat/cold, trembling, time-skips.
* She *suspects* spiking (and later Lauren might say: “You should get checked” / “We can report it”), but you don’t need to prove it on-page.
* Keep the focus on *Sarah’s fear + decision-making*, not the perpetrator.

That keeps it grounded and avoids turning the story into a crime procedural.

---

## Suggested scene packaging (so it flows)

If you like numbering continuity, I’d do:

* **Scene 41 — “Radiant” (Sarah POV)**: Wardrobe day, Faire actresses arrive; Lily on Bree’s arm; Sarah’s quiet awakening.
* **Scene 42 — “Carl” (Sarah POV)**: meet-cute + first dates; Carl as genuinely decent.
* **Scene 43 — “Honest” (Sarah POV)**: Sarah tries, realises it’s not attraction; ends it clean; guilt.
* **Scene 44 — “Not a Blanket” (Sarah POV)**: solo night out → too much drink → sudden illness → calls Lauren → sleeps at Lauren’s → morning realisation.

To get momentum, I can write Scene 41 fully now, then keep going. Here’s Scene 41 👇

---

If you want, I’ll write **Scene 42 (“Carl”)** next — and I’ll make Carl genuinely likeable, respectful, emotionally literate… and still wrong for her, in a way that hurts *because* he’s decent. That’s the exact antidote to the trope you’re worried about. 💛
