**Scene 38 — “Weaponised Helplessness” (Sarah POV)**

There are men who are genuinely incompetent.

And then there are men who are competent enough to *choose* incompetence, because it’s such an efficient way to outsource their lives.

Ethan—of course his name is Ethan—falls firmly into the second category.

I realise it on a Tuesday, which is rude. Tuesday is supposed to be neutral. Tuesday is supposed to be emails and decent coffee and fabric that behaves.

Instead, I’m standing in his kitchen watching him hold a saucepan like it’s a live animal.

“I don’t really… cook,” he says, as if that’s a personality trait, not a survival skill.

The fridge behind him is full of things that aren’t meals. Milk. Eggs. Sauce bottles. A container labelled *Mum’s lasagne* in handwriting so obviously not his that I almost laugh.

“You live alone,” I say.

He grins. “Yeah, but Mum—”

“—does it,” I finish for him.

He blinks. “She likes helping.”

Ah. That familiar line. The one that translates as: *I’ve trained a woman into my domestic life and I’m looking for a replacement model.*

There are other tells.

The way he hands me a plate to wash without asking, like my hands are a service he’s entitled to activate.

The way he says “I’m terrible at laundry” like it’s cute.

The way he brings up moving in together after six weeks, and it’s not because he loves me. It’s because he’s spotted an upgrade path: from Mum to Girlfriend Mum.

At one point he looks genuinely confused that I’m not charmed.

“You’re really organised,” he says. “I like that about you.”

I stare at him.

That’s not a compliment. That’s a job description.

I go home and lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, and I feel something in my chest settle into a hard, clean shape.

I am over him.

Not “thinking about being over him.”

Over him. Done.

So the next day, I do it properly.

I call him. Not text. Not a long message he can forward to his mates for sport.

A call. Clear. Brief. Unambiguous.

“Hi,” I say, and keep my voice neutral. “This isn’t working for me. I’m ending it. I’m not interested in continuing, and I’m not changing my mind.”

There’s a pause on the line where he tries to find the angle.

“Is this about that kitchen thing?” he asks, laughing slightly, like it’s banter.

“It’s about compatibility,” I say. “We’re not compatible.”

Another pause.

Then the tone shifts.

“Oh,” he says, slowly. “So what, you’re just… dumping me.”

“Yes,” I say, because men love euphemisms when they’re losing. “I am.”

He exhales sharply, offended. “Right. Okay. Wow. I didn’t think you were like that.”

I blink.

Like what? A woman with a spine?

“I’m being clear,” I say.

He tries a new tactic. Softness. “Sarah, come on. I just need you to tell me what I did wrong.”

“I’m not your coach,” I say, calm as a surgeon. “Goodbye, Ethan.”

And I end the call.

I don’t block him immediately.

That’s not optimism. That’s evidence-gathering.

It’s not my first rodeo.

---

At Wardrobe, I don’t announce any of this. I don’t want a round of sympathy from women who could weaponise empathy with a single raised eyebrow.

I do, however, allow myself one confession: to Bree, because Bree can make anything bearable by laughing at it without minimising it.

She’s at the big table sorting a bag of pins like they’ve personally offended her.

“How’s Mr. Tuesday?” she asks without looking up.

I drop my tote on the floor and exhale.

“He’s been returned to sender.”

Bree looks up, delighted. “Ooh. That bad?”

“He doesn’t cook,” I say.

Bree’s eyebrows lift. “Like… doesn’t cook as in doesn’t enjoy it? Or doesn’t cook as in would starve without a woman?”

“As in,” I say, “his fridge contains *Mum’s lasagne* and a faith-based relationship with Uber Eats.”

Bree snorts. “Oh no.”

“Oh yes,” I say. “And he’s got that thing. That *thing* where he looks at you like you’re a solution to his life.”

Bree winces. “Replacement mum.”

“Replacement mum,” I confirm. “Like I’ve got ‘domestic manager’ stamped on my forehead.”

Bree taps the pin tray once. “I’d rather chew glass.”

“Exactly.”

Charli is nearby, at the cap table, adjusting ties with that new calm she wears like it belongs to her. She’s listening without looking like she’s listening, which is a skill women develop early.

Bree, with perfect timing, says, “Honestly, babe. Women are just… better.”

She says it jokingly—mostly. Bree always says jokes like she means them and means things like they’re jokes.

I roll my eyes. “Oh, here we go.”

Charli, without looking up, drops in with a deadpan that makes me choke on my own air.

“I’m a fan.”

Bree *howls*, delighted. Tahlia makes a choking noise behind a sleeve. Even Lucy’s mouth twitches as if her face is briefly considering humour before rejecting it on principle.

I glare at them all, purely for show.

“Oh, shut up,” I say. “All of you.”

Charli smiles—real, unguarded—and goes back to tying her knot like she hasn’t just thrown a grenade of charm into my morning.

It’s infuriating how likeable she’s become.

Bree wipes her eyes. “So,” she says, recovering. “He took it well?”

“He took it like a man who’s never been told no without being offered a biscuit afterwards,” I say.

Bree’s expression shifts—still amused, but alert. “Meaning?”

“Meaning he tried sad,” I say. “Then tried offended. Then tried making it my fault.”

Bree points a pin at me. “And you?”

“I was clear,” I say. “No explanation. No negotiation.”

Bree’s approving nod is small but fierce. “Good girl.”

I give her a look.

Bree grins. “Sorry. Bad habit.”

“Mm.”

I should stop there. Wrap it up. Move on.

But my phone buzzes in my pocket like a warning.

I pull it out.

A message from Ethan.

> **Ethan:** Wow. Okay. So that’s it? After everything?
> **Ethan:** I’m outside. We need to talk.

I go very still.

Bree’s smile fades when she sees my face.

“He’s not,” Bree says quietly. “He’s not outside here.”

I look toward the front windows. Nothing. No man at the gate. No shape lingering.

“No,” I say. “Not here.”

Charli’s head lifts slightly. Not panicked. Just attentive. The room’s temperature changes by half a degree—women becoming aware.

I keep my voice calm because I refuse to bring chaos into Wardrobe.

“He’s at my place,” I say.

Bree’s mouth tightens. “Do you want me to call someone?”

“No,” I say. “Not yet.”

I take one breath. Then I do what Mara would do.

I handle it clean.

I type one message back. No emotion. No opening. No softness he can grab.

> **Me:** Do not come to my home. Do not wait for me. Do not contact me again.
> **Me:** If you come near me or my work, I will treat it as harassment and I will act accordingly.

I hit send.

Then, because I’m not daft, I screenshot it.

I create a folder.

**Ethan — dates**

It’s grim how quickly that feels normal.

Bree watches me do it and nods once, approval like a stamp.

Charli’s eyes stay on my face for a beat—quietly concerned, quietly present—then she drops her gaze back to her work, giving me privacy without withdrawing support.

That’s Wardrobe culture in action: *you are not alone, but you are not made into a spectacle.*

The kettle clicks. The iron hisses. Mara’s shears bite through fabric.

Life continues.

My phone buzzes again.

I don’t look at it immediately.

I finish what my hands are doing first, because control is sometimes as simple as choosing the order of actions.

Then I pick it up.

Another message.

> **Ethan:** You can’t do this to me.
> **Ethan:** I just want to talk. Stop being dramatic.

I stare at the words for a moment, feeling something cold and familiar settle in my ribs.

There it is.

The entitlement, plain as daylight.

*Access* framed as *need.*
My boundary framed as *drama.*

Bree’s voice is low. “Sarah.”

“I know,” I say.

I don’t reply.

Not now.

Because the next reply will be the kind that changes the game. The kind that invites escalation if you do it wrong.

I slide my phone back into my pocket and lift my chin.

“Work,” I say, mostly to myself.

Bree’s grin returns—smaller, harder. “Work,” she echoes.

And Charli, from the cap table, says quietly, almost under her breath:

“You won’t get used to that.”

I glance at her.

She meets my eyes with a calm that isn’t pity and isn’t fear.

Just truth.

I exhale once, slow.

“No,” I agree. “I won’t.”

And I go back to the table, letting the room hold steady around me, while somewhere outside of it a man realises—too late—that I am not his mother, and I am not his solution.

I am his boundary.

✨ Truth-Time ✨

[26-02-03]

**Scene 38 — “Truth-Time” (Celeste POV)**

I didn’t sit back. I stayed forward in the chair, elbows on my knees, like I was about to take a measurement that mattered.

Charli’s hands were folded so tightly her knuckles looked pale. She kept her eyes on them, as if eye contact might be mistaken for bargaining.

I waited until her breathing stopped skittering.

“When did it start?” I asked.

Her head lifted, cautious.

“The… ‘she’?” she whispered.

“The secrecy,” I said. “The part where everyone at Wardrobe knew something about you that I didn’t.”

Charli swallowed. Her throat bobbed like she was forcing something down that didn’t want to go.

“Months,” she admitted. “I think… months.”

I nodded once. Not approval. Not forgiveness. Receipt.

“All right,” I said. “Tell me properly.”

She stared at her hands as if they might give her the language.

“I didn’t plan it,” she said. “It wasn’t… a thing I chose. Not at first.”

“Start anyway,” I said. “Chronologically.”

Charli took a breath. It trembled on the way out.

“It was little,” she began. “At first it was… they’d say it when I wasn’t meant to hear. Or they’d catch themselves. Or someone would correct someone else like it mattered. And I… I thought I was imagining it.”

I held my expression steady. Let her speak.

“And then,” she continued, “it wasn’t just words. It was… the way they moved around me. The way they made room. The way they stopped… bracing.”

Her eyes lifted to mine for a second, then dropped again.

“You knew,” she whispered.

“Apparently,” I said.

Charli flinched at the dryness. Good. She needed to feel the consequence without me having to raise my voice.

“They didn’t tell me,” she said quickly. “Not like… not like a meeting. It was just… happening. Like a tide coming in.”

“And you let it,” I said.

She nodded, miserable. “Yes.”

I waited. Let the silence drag the real truth up.

Charli’s voice went smaller.

“And then it got… normal,” she said. “And that’s when it got scary.”

I tilted my head a fraction. “Why.”

Her eyes squeezed shut for a moment.

“Because if it was normal,” she said, “then it was real. And if it was real, then—” She opened her eyes and finally met mine, bare and terrified. “Then I could lose it.”

A beat.

There it was. Not malice.

Scarcity.

The instinct of someone who has lived too long in a world where belonging is conditional and can be revoked without explanation.

“You thought telling me would risk it,” I said.

Charli nodded hard. “Yes.”

“And you thought not telling me would protect it,” I continued.

Another nod. “Yes.”

I watched her swallow again, the throat working, the shame building.

“And the worst part,” she whispered, “is I thought I was being… good.”

The word *good* broke something in me and hardened something else.

Because Charli’s idea of “good” had been trained into her by fear.

“Explain,” I said.

Charli’s hands twisted in her lap.

“I thought you had enough pressure,” she said. “I thought if I… brought you this—this messy thing—then you’d have to manage it. You’d have to decide how to act at Wardrobe. How to handle it. How to… not make it worse.”

I stayed still, listening.

“And I didn’t want to be the reason you had to do more work,” she added. “I didn’t want to be one more problem.”

My mouth tightened.

“Charli,” I said, carefully, “do you understand that you just described love as a debt.”

Her eyes widened.

“I didn’t—”

“You did,” I said. “You described it as something you have to earn by not costing me anything.”

Tears spilled faster now. She wiped them with the back of her hand—one rough swipe, like she hated herself for leaking.

“I’m sorry,” she said, and the words came out broken. “I’m sorry. I was trying— I was trying to keep you happy.”

“And you decided,” I said, “that my happiness depended on ignorance.”

She recoiled as if I’d struck her.

“No,” she whispered. “No, I—”

I didn’t raise my voice. I didn’t need to.

“I need you to hear this,” I said, and my tone went calm in the way it did when I was most serious. “You did the opposite of what you intended.”

Charli froze.

I let it sink in.

“You wanted to protect me,” I continued. “But you protected me from the one thing I require: the truth.”

Her face crumpled. She made a small sound—half breath, half sob.

“I didn’t know,” she whispered. “I didn’t know it would hurt you like that.”

“You didn’t *ask*,” I said.

The sentence was simple. It was lethal.

Charli nodded. Her shoulders shook.

“I thought if I kept it quiet,” she said, and she sounded suddenly younger, as if the fear had peeled her back to an old age inside her, “then if it went wrong, it would only hurt me. And if it went right… you’d just get the finished version. The safe version.”

I stared at her.

“And you thought I’d prefer you safe rather than real.”

She nodded again, helpless.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Because… because everyone does.”

I felt something move in my chest. Not forgiveness.

Recognition.

Survival instinct. A patterned response. Not a calculated betrayal.

But it still wasn’t acceptable.

I let the silence sit long enough that she had to face it.

Then I spoke.

“I’m going to say something and you’re going to sit still and take it,” I said.

Charli’s head lifted slightly. She nodded once, obedient.

“I do not want the safe version,” I said. “I want the real one. And if you ever decide again that you will give me a curated version of reality because you think you know what I can handle—” I paused, because I wanted the next words to land clean. “—you will lose the part of me you like.”

Her breath caught.

Not because I was threatening to leave.

Because she understood I was describing consequences, not drama.

“Okay,” she whispered.

I watched her swallow.

“Say it back,” I said.

Charli blinked. “What?”

“The rule,” I said. “So I know you heard it.”

She wiped her face again, cheeks wet, eyes red.

“No more secrets,” she whispered. Then, as if it hurt to say it, she added, “Not from you.”

I held her gaze.

“Not from *me*,” I corrected.

Her mouth trembled. “Not from you,” she repeated, and this time it sounded like surrender rather than agreement.

“Good,” I said.

Charli inhaled shakily.

“And—” she started, then stopped, as if she didn’t deserve to continue.

“Go on,” I said.

Her voice came out ragged.

“And if something changes at Wardrobe… if something shifts, or the girls… if there’s anything I think might matter…” She swallowed. “I tell you. Even if I’m scared.”

“Yes,” I said. “Especially if you’re scared.”

Another nod. Tears fell again. She looked utterly wrecked by the clarity.

And then she did something that told me she was truly in it: she didn’t try to bargain for comfort. She didn’t reach for me. She stayed seated and miserable and honest.

“I was terrified,” she whispered. “I was terrified that if you knew, you’d look at me and think… *this is too complicated.* And you’d step back. And then everyone would step back because you stepped back.”

Her words came out in a rush now, like confession.

“And I didn’t want that to be my fault,” she said. “I didn’t want to be the thing that made you regret… any of it. The bench. The promises. The way you—” She stopped, choking. “The way you looked at me.”

There it was: the true shape of her fear.

Not the “she.” Not the girls.

Celeste’s gaze.

Celeste’s choice.

I felt my anger flare again—because she’d made me a symbol, not a person. Because she’d tried to control my reactions out of terror of losing them.

But beneath it, I could see it: the survival reflex.

Someone who believed love was always contingent.

I held the line anyway.

“Charli,” I said, “do you know what you took from me?”

She shook her head, eyes wide.

“My choice,” I said.

Her face went white.

“You made me the last person to know you were safe,” I continued. “You made me the last person to know you were included. You made me—” I stopped, because the next part was the vulnerable truth, and I hated giving it air. I gave it anyway. “—you made me feel out of control in a place where I thought we were building control together.”

Charli’s shoulders collapsed. She didn’t just cry now—she folded forward, hands clamped over her mouth as if the sound of herself was unbearable.

“I’m sorry,” she choked. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry— I didn’t mean—”

I lifted a hand.

“Stop,” I said.

She froze mid-sob, eyes huge.

I kept my voice measured. “I believe you weren’t trying to hurt me.”

Charli stared, disbelieving.

“But,” I added, “you did hurt me.”

A shiver moved through her.

“And I’m not going to pretend you didn’t,” I said. “Because that’s how resentment grows teeth.”

She nodded, shaking.

I let her breathe.

Then I said the part that acknowledged her survival instinct without excusing it.

“You did what you’ve learned to do,” I said. “You managed. You minimised. You tried to keep the powerful person calm so you could keep your place.”

Charli’s eyes squeezed shut. A sob escaped anyway.

“I hate that,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said. “But you need to recognise it. Because if you don’t name it, you’ll do it again.”

She nodded hard. “I will name it. I will. I didn’t realise. I didn’t realise I was… doing that to you.”

A beat.

Then she said, very small, very raw:

“I thought I was protecting you. And I did the thing that hurts you most.”

I watched her. The sentence had cost her. It wasn’t performance. It was comprehension.

This was the moment that mattered.

I didn’t soften into romance. Not yet.

But I did give her something, because she needed a path forward that wasn’t “be perfect or lose everything.”

“You don’t fix this by grovelling,” I said.

Charli blinked at me, startled. Like she’d been expecting to be told she had to suffer to be forgiven.

“You fix it by changing your behaviour,” I continued. “Boringly. Consistently. No theatrics.”

Her lower lip trembled.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can do that. I can— I will.”

I nodded once.

“And,” I said, because she needed to hear the other half, “I’m not withdrawing what I offered you earlier.”

Her eyes flew up.

I held her gaze.

“I meant it,” I said. “The bench. The promises. The more to come.”

Charli looked like she couldn’t breathe.

“But,” I added, and my voice sharpened into a clean edge, “you don’t get to use intimacy as a way to avoid accountability. You don’t get comfort as a sedative.”

She swallowed. Nodded. “Okay.”

“Good,” I said.

A silence settled. Not warm. Not hostile.

Functional.

Charli wiped her face again, slow this time, calmer. Like she was putting herself back together deliberately.

“Can I say one more thing?” she asked.

“Yes,” I replied. “But make it true.”

Her mouth trembled into something like a sad smile.

“I was scared,” she said, “that if I told you… I would cause the very thing I was trying to prevent. That you would step back.”

She met my eyes fully now—brave in the way frightened people are brave.

“And by not telling you,” she whispered, “I caused it anyway.”

I felt the sentence hit something in me and settle there.

That was the irony. The education. The painful clarity.

I nodded once, slowly.

“Yes,” I said. “You did.”

Charli flinched—but she didn’t look away this time.

She took the truth.

I let the beat hold. Then I stood.

Not to leave. To signal transition.

“You’re going to get us water,” I said. “Then you’re going to sit back down. And you’re going to tell me what you need from me when you get scared—so you don’t default to secrecy.”

Charli stared, stunned. “You… you still want—”

“I want reality,” I cut in, and there was the softness, finally, like a hand placed on the back of her neck. “I want you to bring me the messy version. Not the polished one.”

Her eyes filled again.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I paused at the doorway, just long enough to make sure she understood the terms.

“And Charli,” I added.

She looked up.

My voice lowered, quiet and precise.

“This is me choosing you with my eyes open,” I said. “Don’t you ever take that from me again.”

Her face broke. She nodded, fiercely, like she was making a vow with her whole body.

“I won’t,” she whispered. “I won’t. I swear.”

I let myself exhale once.

Then I turned toward the kitchen.

And behind me, I heard her move—slowly, carefully—like someone who had finally understood that being loved didn’t mean being managed.

It meant being known.

---

### Quick craft note (not required, but helpful)

If you want Charli to “grovel” without it becoming melodrama, keep it **behavioural** rather than verbal:

* she **stays seated** when she wants to crawl to Celeste
* she **repeats the rule back**
* she **accepts the consequence** (no immediate cuddles/kisses)
* she **asks what to do next** (repair through action)

That reads as *earnest*, not performative.

If you want, I can now draft **Scene 39** (the later warmth returning safely), where Charli demonstrates the “boring reliability” proof—and the bench promise gets honoured in a way that feels inevitable rather than soothing.

“And—” she started, then stopped, as if she didn’t deserve to continue.

“Go on,” I said.

Her voice came out ragged.

“And if something changes at Wardrobe… if something shifts, or the girls… if there’s anything I think might matter…” She swallowed. “I tell you. Even if I’m scared.”

“Yes,” I said. “Especially if you’re scared.”

Another nod. Tears fell again. She looked utterly wrecked by the clarity.

And then she did something that told me she was truly in it: she didn’t try to bargain for comfort. She didn’t reach for me. She stayed seated and miserable and honest.

“I was terrified,” she whispered. “I was terrified that if you knew, you’d look at me and think… *this is too complicated.* And you’d step back. And then everyone would step back because you stepped back.”

Her words came out in a rush now, like confession.

“And I didn’t want that to be my fault,” she said. “I didn’t want to be the thing that made you regret… any of it. The bench. The promises. The way you—” She stopped, choking. “The way you looked at me.”

There it was: the true shape of her fear.

Not the “she.” Not the girls.

Celeste’s gaze.

Celeste’s choice.

I felt my anger flare again—because she’d made me a symbol, not a person. Because she’d tried to control my reactions out of terror of losing them.

But beneath it, I could see it: the survival reflex.

Someone who believed love was always contingent.

I held the line anyway.

“Charli,” I said, “do you know what you took from me?”

She shook her head, eyes wide.

“My choice,” I said.

Her face went white.

“You made me the last person to know you were safe,” I continued. “You made me the last person to know you were included. You made me—” I stopped, because the next part was the vulnerable truth, and I hated giving it air. I gave it anyway. “—you made me feel out of control in a place where I thought we were building control together.”

Charli’s shoulders collapsed. She didn’t just cry now—she folded forward, hands clamped over her mouth as if the sound of herself was unbearable.

“I’m sorry,” she choked. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry— I didn’t mean—”

I lifted a hand.

“Stop,” I said.

She froze mid-sob, eyes huge.

I kept my voice measured. “I believe you weren’t trying to hurt me.”

Charli stared, disbelieving.

“But,” I added, “you did hurt me.”

A shiver moved through her.

“And I’m not going to pretend you didn’t,” I said. “Because that’s how resentment grows teeth.”

She nodded, shaking.

I let her breathe.

Then I said the part that acknowledged her survival instinct without excusing it.

“You did what you’ve learned to do,” I said. “You managed. You minimised. You tried to keep the powerful person calm so you could keep your place.”

Charli’s eyes squeezed shut. A sob escaped anyway.

“I hate that,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said. “But you need to recognise it. Because if you don’t name it, you’ll do it again.”

She nodded hard. “I will name it. I will. I didn’t realise. I didn’t realise I was… doing that to you.”

A beat.

Then she said, very small, very raw:

“I thought I was protecting you. And I did the thing that hurts you most.”

I watched her. The sentence had cost her. It wasn’t performance. It was comprehension.

This was the moment that mattered.

I didn’t soften into romance. Not yet.

But I did give her something, because she needed a path forward that wasn’t “be perfect or lose everything.”

“You don’t fix this by grovelling,” I said.

Charli blinked at me, startled. Like she’d been expecting to be told she had to suffer to be forgiven.

“You fix it by changing your behaviour,” I continued. “Boringly. Consistently. No theatrics.”

Her lower lip trembled.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can do that. I can— I will.”

I nodded once.

“And,” I said, because she needed to hear the other half, “I’m not withdrawing what I offered you earlier.”

Her eyes flew up.

I held her gaze.

“I meant it,” I said. “The bench. The promises. The more to come.”

Charli looked like she couldn’t breathe.

“But,” I added, and my voice sharpened into a clean edge, “you don’t get to use intimacy as a way to avoid accountability. You don’t get comfort as a sedative.”

She swallowed. Nodded. “Okay.”

“Good,” I said.

A silence settled. Not warm. Not hostile.

Functional.

Charli wiped her face again, slow this time, calmer. Like she was putting herself back together deliberately.

“Can I say one more thing?” she asked.

“Yes,” I replied. “But make it true.”

Her mouth trembled into something like a sad smile.

“I was scared,” she said, “that if I told you… I would cause the very thing I was trying to prevent. That you would step back.”

She met my eyes fully now—brave in the way frightened people are brave.

“And by not telling you,” she whispered, “I caused it anyway.”

I felt the sentence hit something in me and settle there.

That was the irony. The education. The painful clarity.

I nodded once, slowly.

“Yes,” I said. “You did.”

Charli flinched—but she didn’t look away this time.

She took the truth.

I let the beat hold. Then I stood.

Not to leave. To signal transition.

“You’re going to get us water,” I said. “Then you’re going to sit back down. And you’re going to tell me what you need from me when you get scared—so you don’t default to secrecy.”

Charli stared, stunned. “You… you still want—”

“I want reality,” I cut in, and there was the softness, finally, like a hand placed on the back of her neck. “I want you to bring me the messy version. Not the polished one.”

Her eyes filled again.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I paused at the doorway, just long enough to make sure she understood the terms.

“And Charli,” I added.

She looked up.

My voice lowered, quiet and precise.

“This is me choosing you with my eyes open,” I said. “Don’t you ever take that from me again.”

Her face broke. She nodded, fiercely, like she was making a vow with her whole body.

“I won’t,” she whispered. “I won’t. I swear.”

I let myself exhale once.

Then I turned toward the kitchen.

And behind me, I heard her move—slowly, carefully—like someone who had finally understood that being loved didn’t mean being managed.

It meant being known.

### Scene 50

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116al.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[26-01-23]

**Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.

So, what you don't see in that first image are the undergarments: dollars to donuts she's wearing stays. The second is classic Flux (dimpled chin) and yeah: Flux doesn't know about the chemise, which the first girl was wearing (layers: drawstring chemise; stays; overdress) so it does the lacey square neckline. I'm not sure, but your third girl (painting?) looks like Regency. And Stable Diffusion, bless its pointy little head, missed it by centuries: very Henry VIII. Again, the girl in green isn't wearing a chemise with stays... she's wearing a coset dress with a lace square neckline. Pretty, but it says "costume". 

Kontext has the overdress shape sort-or right but no chemise, again.

I ran the next girl image (outside, bonnet, book) by Emily... I was guessing Regency. Emily replied:

Yes — Regency / late Georgian is the right call 😊
What you’ve got here is very “Jane Austen era,” roughly 1805–1818 (give or take a few years):
High empire waist sitting just under the bust
Long, slim skirt that falls straight rather than bell-shaped
Narrow shoulders with only modest puffing (not the huge gigot sleeves of the 1830s)
Bonnet with ties that fits the early-19th silhouette beautifully

So: Regency (early 19th century) rather than Victorian, and definitely not the 1830s+.
