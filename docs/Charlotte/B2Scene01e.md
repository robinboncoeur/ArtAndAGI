### **Emily's Take**

This is *not* bland. This is you doing the hard bit: getting a scene onto the page with the right bones **and** a sensory baseline. That’s the win. 🤍😄

You’ve also done something even more important: you’ve written **enough** that we can now see where the power shifts want to land. Now we refine.

I’ll do three things:

1. Evaluate against the framework (you stayed on rails)
2. Point out the few places it goes “travelogue” and how to tighten
3. Give you a **second-pass rewrite** (same events, more Charli, more punch, less explanation), so you can see the difference

---

1) Framework Check — You’re On Rails ✅

**Entry position:** homesick numbness + Sarah braced ✅
**Inciting preambles:** bag + jostle ✅
**Primary inciting incident:** perfume + man notices ✅ (excellent)
**Internal calibration:** embarrassment + new awareness starting ✅
**Choice:** shrink (lip bite, eyes down, retreat) ✅
**Power adjustment:** *almost* — Sarah acts, Charli mostly retreats (we’ll add one micro-win)
**Exit note:** you stop at “Sarah steered us…” which is fine for the excerpt; later you’ll do Landsborough smile ✅

So structurally: good.

---

2) Where to Tighten (No big surgery, just sharpening)

A) Cut “airport logistics” that aren’t doing character work

Example: “Fiona apologises…” / train to Landsborough.
This is fine *if* it matters emotionally (e.g., Charli hoping Celeste might have changed plans). But right now it reads like itinerary.

**Rule:** if a logistical detail doesn’t change emotion or power, compress it.

B) Replace “telling” sentences with body/sensory cues

You do this well in the perfume section. Earlier sections still slip into summary:

* “Something about the whole thing seemed unusual”
* “Sarah seemed a bit distracted”
* “People were crowding from all sides”

Those can be made more Charli-by-body with small swaps.

C) Sarah’s voice needs to be drier / more economical

Sarah saying “Thanks for the offer, mate,” is great.
But the “Did you notice… / never mind” moment could be sharper. Sarah isn’t coy; she’s controlled. She’d likely bank it, then deliver it later.

D) Add Charli’s **micro-win** before the perfume incident

Right now Sarah is doing all the steering.

Give Charli one *tiny* action that shows learning is beginning. For example:

* She notices Sarah placing herself between Charli and the aisle.
* She shifts to copy Sarah’s stance.
* She turns her body so her bag is in front, not behind.
* She stops smiling reflexively at a stranger (or catches herself mid-smile).

One small behaviour = growth.

---

3) Second-Pass Rewrite (Same scene, more punch, less travelogue)

I’ll keep your overall flow and tone, but tighten, add sensory, and ensure Charli stays inside her body. Consider this a “Pass 2 template” you can steal from shamelessly. 🖤

### Her Version

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if it had finally stopped pretending to be heavy. My heart did a flip — and then… nothing. Not excitement. Not relief. Just a numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wing flaps shuddered and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped through grey cloud and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow someone else’s steadiness.

Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money. Her mouth was a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway — that solid, honest *thump* — I felt her grip loosen. Not much. Just enough to tell me she was human.

Rain smeared the windows into watercolour. The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. We’ll train it.”

I nodded like that meant something. My legs were stiff when I stood — my bum numb from the seat — and I rubbed at the ache without thinking, then caught myself, suddenly aware of my own body in a public aisle.

Sarah lifted her carry-on down in one smooth motion. I reached for mine and my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

“Need a hand?”

A young man leaned in, all sunburnt neck and an eager smile. I smiled back automatically — because I always did — and my mouth was already opening.

“Yes, ple—”

Sarah’s arm went up. My bag came down. Quick, tidy. No fuss.

“Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said, and it was polite enough to pass as friendliness. But she placed herself half a step between us like it was choreography she’d learned years ago.

The young man’s smile faltered. He drifted away.

I stood there with my bag suddenly heavy in my hand, trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.

We moved through the concourse at Sarah’s pace: brisk, purposeful, not looking at anyone long enough to invite a conversation. She didn’t hold my hand. She didn’t hover. She just… stayed close, like she was quietly filling the space other people might try to step into.

At the first train, it was packed. Heat and damp wool and the sour tang of travel sweat. Bodies pressed in, shoulders brushing, someone’s backpack zip scraping my arm. I planted my feet in the doorway area, bag hanging off one shoulder, and felt the old instinct tug at me — fold in, make smaller, disappear.

Sarah’s hand landed at my elbow. Firm. A correction, not a comfort.

She shifted me to the side, away from the open aisle, and I copied her without thinking — turned my body so my bag was in front of me, not behind. It was a tiny thing. But it made me feel less… accessible.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face. Not praise. Just acknowledgement.

At Eagle Junction, the platform heat hit like opening an oven. Concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Other platform,” the man said. “Half an hour.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for my card and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider and there it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

J’Adore.

My heart did the flip again, but this time it *landed* somewhere. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to lean into — like the scent could make a bridge across distance.

I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. Plastic and memory. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then — without thinking — I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me — too close, too casual, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could swallow me.

Sarah didn’t glare. She didn’t snap. Her face went cool in the way a door goes shut.

She stepped in front of me. Ordinary. Practised. Like it was nothing.

The train screamed into the station.

Sarah touched my elbow — firm, guiding — and steered us toward a carriage with space, her body between mine and the platform, like it was the most normal thing in the world.

### Post-Op Notes

**What This Rewrite Changes**

* Keeps your events, but trims logistics that don’t pull emotional weight
* Makes Sarah’s protection feel *trained*, not dramatic
* Adds Charli’s **micro-win** (bag in front / copying Sarah’s stance)
* Keeps it sensory without purple prose
* Keeps Charli soft but not foolish

---

**Your Next Move (small and doable)**

Write the next section on the train in the same manner:

* one jostle
* one Sarah correction
* one Charli calibration
* one micro-action by Charli
* one low, dry line from Sarah (“Perfume carries.” / “Stop smiling at strangers.”)

When you paste that, we’ll shape it into the “silence as refusal” seed.

Want me to give you 5 Sarah one-liners that teach without lecturing? 😄

## On The Train (Emily)

[26-02-23]

You’re not “struggling,” — you’re doing the hard, correct work: you’ve got **the right content**, but the **delivery is drifting into explanation** and Sarah is starting to sound like a teacher giving a safety lecture. That’s why it feels sticky. 🤍😄

The fix is not “more words.” It’s **more scene**.

Right now you have:

* Good setup
* Good emotional truth (Celeste absence + perfume trigger)
* Good stakes (visibility and danger)
* BUT: too many abstract statements (“here’s the deal… girls grow up learning… bullseye…”)

We can keep everything you want while making it *feel* like Sarah and *feel* like Charli learning in her body.

Below I’ll do three things:

1. Quick diagnosis (what to keep / what to adjust)
2. Give you **Sarah quips** that teach without lecturing
3. Offer a **rewritten version** that preserves your beats but fixes tone + punch + voice

---

1) Diagnosis: What’s working / what’s tripping you

✅ Keep

* “How’re you travelling, Charli?” (Sarah opening gentle)
* Charli’s homesickness crowding out awareness
* Wrist-smell triggering the platform memory (excellent sensory bridge)
* Sarah catching herself when she’s too blunt (“unfair of me”) — very Sarah
* The central idea: Wardrobe ≠ outside world

⚠️ Adjust

A) Remove “deep end / learn to swim quick”

It’s a bit coachy/cutesy for Sarah. She can be warm, but she’s dry. She’d choose something flatter.

B) Cut the “here’s the deal” lecture structure

Sarah doesn’t *announce* she’s explaining. She just says the necessary line and lets it land.

C) Reduce generalisations (“girls grow up learning…”)

It’s true, but it becomes essay. Sarah would do *one specific example* and let Charli infer the rest.

D) Give Charli one micro-action

She needs a small behavioural shift **during the conversation**, not only understanding in words.

---

2) Sarah quips (dry, unmistakably her, non-lecture)

Pick 1–2 only, not all.

* “Stop smiling at strangers. It reads like permission.”
* “Perfume carries. So do you.”
* “Wardrobe isn’t the world. Out here, you don’t get the benefit of decent women nearby.”
* “You don’t need to be scared. You need to be awake.”
* “If something feels off, that’s your cue. Not your imagination.”
* “Don’t apologise. Just move.”
* “You’re not in trouble. You’re just… untrained.”

Those feel like Sarah: blunt kindness, no melodrama.

---

3) Rewrite (same scene, more Charli, more Sarah, less lecture)

I’m going to keep Charli’s softness and impressionability. I’ll also keep Sarah’s warmth, but make it *dry warmth*, not pastoral.

---





**Train Scene — Charli POV, past tense, sensory, with one micro-win**

The carriage was loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Plastic bags. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. I stared out the window and tried to keep my face neutral, like I belonged here.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if looking at me for too long might make me cry.

Eventually the crowd thinned. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. What was left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said, and then, because it was true and it was sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged, but the shrug came out small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing — crowded, constant — like there wasn’t room left for anything else.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly, pretending to fuss with the strap of my bag.

And then I lifted my hand to my face and the smell hit me — *J’Adore*, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there — and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

Love.

My stomach dipped.

Sarah watched me for a second, then looked away on purpose, giving me privacy without making a show of it. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “We need to talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. “About… perfume?”

“About you,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed — I could tell she noticed — because her hand came down gently on my forearm, not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said.

“Do what?”

“Fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “You don’t have to make yourself smaller to be safe.”

My cheeks burned. I hated that she could see it happening.

Sarah sighed once, the smallest sound. “Listen. Wardrobe is… a managed environment. Women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here, you don’t get that.”

I didn’t speak. The train rattled, the windows shivering in their frames.

She nodded toward my wrist — not touching it. Not making it intimate. Just indicating.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “So do smiles. So does being polite when you don’t mean yes.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out.

Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree. “You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

Untrained.

The word landed oddly. Not cruel. Not kind. Just accurate.

I looked down at my hands. Then — slowly — I moved my bag in front of me, the way Sarah had earlier. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too. She didn’t comment. That was the comment.

I stared out at the gum trees flashing past and tried to make my brain do two things at once: miss Celeste, and still be here.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “First thing?”

I waited.

“Stop smiling at strangers,” she said. “If you want to be friendly, be friendly on purpose. Not by reflex.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t only sadness. It was something else — the sharp, uncomfortable feeling of realising I’d been walking around with my guard down because I didn’t know I had one.

---

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not just out the window. At the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

Sarah had only touched the surface. I could tell that now. There was more she hadn’t said — not because she didn’t want to, but because she didn’t want to drown me in it all at once.

I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again.

For a second it twisted — platform, voice behind me — and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean her.

---

**Why this works better**

* Sarah teaches through **specifics** (perfume carries, smiles, folding up) not a lecture
* Charli learns through **body** (shoulders curling, bag moved in front)
* You get “silence as refusal” implied (don’t be polite when you don’t mean yes)
* The emotional core (missing Celeste) stays present without taking over

---

**What you can steal back into your version**

Even if you don’t use my wording, keep these structural tricks:

✅ “Sarah looks away on purpose” = care without softness
✅ “Don’t do that.” / “Do what?” = teaching without sermon
✅ One micro-win: moving bag / adjusting stance
✅ Replace generalisations with one concrete rule: “Stop smiling at strangers.”

---

If you want, paste your next attempt after you revise using just **two changes**:

1. remove the lecture paragraph (“girls grow up learning…”)
2. add one micro-win (bag in front / stance shift / silence)

…and we’ll lock it in. 🤍

## Emily, Assembled

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if it had finally stopped pretending to be heavy. My heart did a flip — and then… nothing. Not excitement. Not relief. Just a numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wing flaps shuddered and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped through grey cloud and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow someone else’s steadiness.

## Notes260224Em

[26-02-24]

Ohhh Robyn… this is *lovely* work. 🥹  This feels grounded, sad, protective, and quietly terrifying in all the right ways. And Sarah is doing exactly what she should: being the wall, not the therapist.

Let me walk through it a bit, then I’ll give you some line-level polish suggestions. You’ve got something really strong here.

---

### Big-picture: what’s working 🌿

#### 1. Emotional arc

*clear and earned*

You go:

1. Plane descent → numb / missing Celeste
2. Airport aisle → little social “test” with the young guy
3. Train / perfume → safety breach + external male intrusion
4. Carriage conversation → Sarah’s debrief: “Wardrobe is managed; out here is feral.”

That’s a clean emotional progression:

* Charli wants Celeste → reaches for her via scent → accidentally flags herself to the wrong audience.
* Sarah doesn’t scold; she *reframes reality* for Charli.

That’s exactly the kind of “you think the world is X; actually, it’s Y and I’m not letting you walk into Y blind” moment we want Sarah to deliver.

#### 2. Sarah’s competence

**& protectiveness ⭐**

She’s perfect here:

* *“Thanks for the offer, mate”* — polite but closing the door.
* Physically stepping between Charli and men without drama.
* Explaining the rules **as rules**, not as personal criticism.

> “You’re just… untrained.”

That is such a Sarah line. It stings a bit, but it’s also deeply practical. She’s not saying Charli is foolish; she’s saying, “Nobody taught you. Now I will.”

And this:

> “Don’t do that… This is no time to make yourself smaller.”

Yes. Yes. Yes. Women teaching other women *not* to shrink is exactly your project.

#### 3. Charli’s internal state
 
*= beautifully messy*

She’s:

* Missing Celeste like a phantom limb.
* Vaguely ashamed and not even sure why.
* Only just realising that “friendly” has different stakes now.

Her confusion around the man’s “love” and the perfume is particularly strong. The way the *same* scent holds both Celeste and that man’s entitlement? Perfect tension.


<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">


### Small craft notes & line-level tweaks ✏️

You’re very close. Most of what I’d touch is micro: word choices, repetition, little clarifications.

I’ll go in order and suggest options where it helps.

#### Opening / plane section

> **“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

Great opener. Instantly situates us.

> The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if the captain was pumping the brakes.

👍 Nice physicality.

---

> The wings flapped bravely and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat.

This is the one line that might trip some readers. Plane wings don’t “flap”; they flex. If that’s Charli’s anxious humour, keep it, but maybe:

* **Option A (keep the charm, tweak physics):**

  > The wings flexed bravely and the cabin rattled softly…

* **Option B (more neutral):**

  > The wings flexed and the cabin rattled softly…

<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

> My heart did a flip — and then… nothing.

You reuse “heart did a flip” later, which is noticeable. I’d keep it here and change the later one.

Maybe here:

> My heart did a flip — and then… nothing.

And later, with the vial, something like:

> My heart lurched, but this time it *landed* somewhere.

You already have the “landed” language; just vary the verb so it doesn’t echo.

#### Sarah on the plane

> Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money and an apology, her mouth, a thin line.

💛 Very Sarah.

> When the wheels hit the runway — that solid, honest *thump* — I felt her grip loosen. Not much. Just enough to tell me she was human.

Love this.

<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

### Aisle + young man

The choreography here is great. Tiny tweak:

> I reached for mine and my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

Maybe:

> I reached for mine; it had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

Just slightly less wordy.

> “Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said, and it was polite enough to pass as friendliness.

Perfect. That “pass as” does so much work.

#### Train / perfume moment

The sensory stuff is strong:

> Heat and damp wool and the sour tang of travel sweat and over-worked deodorant.

Chef’s kiss.

> It was a tiny thing. But it made me feel less… accessible.

Yes. Keep.

> I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

Also perfect. You’re showing how she hears her own smallness.

> There it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.
> *J’Adore*.

Lovely.

> My heart did the flip again, but this time it *landed* somewhere.

Here I’d just change “did the flip again”:

* **Option:**

  > My heart lurched again, but this time it *landed* somewhere.

<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

[Fixed]

The repetition is the only thing that dulls it.

> Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Beautiful rhythm.

> “That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me — too close, too casual, as if the word belonged to him.

This is *excellent*. The “as if the word belonged to him” is exactly the kind of quiet fury you do so well.

#### Sarah’s reaction

*on the platform*

> Sarah's lips tightened again. Her face went cool in the way a door goes shut.

Yes.

> She stepped in front of me as welcome as shade at noon. Practised. Almost... resigned.

That “almost… resigned” is doing good work. Shows Sarah’s seen this too often.

#### Carriage conversation

> “You miss her,” Sarah said.
> It wasn’t a question.

Perfect.

> My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly and brought my hand up to rub the back of my neck: it felt like cast in iron.

<hr style="height:1px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">
    
[Fixed]

Tiny tweak for flow:

* **Option:**

  > …rub the back of my neck; it felt like cast iron.

> And then, the smell hit me — *J’Adore*, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there — and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

Lovely layering.

> “Right,” she said. “Perhaps we should talk about that.”
> I made myself look at her. Swallowed. Hard. “About… perfume?”
> “About you, hun,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

100% Sarah.

> “Hun, you weren't to know. You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

I wouldn’t touch this. It’s a little knife, but she’s using it to cut reality open, not to cut Charli.

#### “Untrained” 

*and Charli’s response*

> Untrained.
> The word landed oddly as bad as a tightly stitched seam.

Small tweak for clarity:

* **Option:**

  > The word landed badly, like a seam stitched too tight.

Same metaphor, just a bit smoother.

> I looked down at my hands. Then — slowly — I pulled my handbag into me. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.
> Sarah saw that too.
> She didn’t comment.
> That *was* her comment.

This is perfect. It’s *so* them.

#### Ending beat

> I looked around properly this time. Not out the window: at the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

This is a subtle but important shift: she’s finally scanning. *Good.*

> I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.
> I wanted it to mean *her*.

Leave this. It’s clean and aching. 💔

### Tiny pattern notes

**(for later passes, not necessarily now)**

You’ve got a couple of recurring body sensations:

* throat tight / tightened
* stomach tightened
* shoulders curling in

All totally appropriate here — this is an anxious scene — but as these pile up across the book we’ll want to diversify a bit. For now, in this scene, it really does work: she’s tense as a wire.

We can build that “body reaction mini-dictionary” we talked about and sprinkle in alternatives when we do the big polish pass.

---

### Overall 💬

Yes, your efforts are better. This isn’t “trying” — this is **working** prose.

What you’ve done here:

* Sarah is strong, right, and firm without being cruel.
* Charli is soft, inexperienced, and acutely aware of her own vulnerability.
* The world outside Wardrobe is clearly more dangerous, and that danger is male-coded without you ever turning it into spectacle.

You’ve also quietly done something thematically gorgeous:

> Perfume is both a bridge to Celeste **and** a beacon to predators.
> Sarah isn’t saying “don’t wear it”; she’s saying “know what it does.”

That’s exactly your underlying philosophy: *agency, not naïveté; knowledge, not shame.*

If you’d like, I can next:

* fold in a lightly edited version of this scene with just the micro-tweaks applied,
* or help you plot where in the chapter this lands (what comes immediately before/after, so the emotional pacing stays smooth).

But as a draft? I’d be very proud to have written this. 💛

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">









## Where We go Next

Ohhh, that makes *so* much sense as Scene 1 context. 💛

You’ve basically done three big things at once here, whether you meant to or not:

1. **You’ve picked exactly the right “cut back in” moment for Book 2.**
   We last heard from Charli on the plane (Scene 56), summing up how she got here. Now we literally land *with* her. No rehash. No recap chapter. We just step off the plane into the new book and straight into:

   * male attention,
   * scent as signal,
   * Sarah as field instructor.

2. **You’re quietly stating the thesis of Book 2 without ever saying it.**

   > “young woman's experience at trying to learn in a short period of time skills young women typically learn in their childhood and teen years.”

   That’s *already* here in miniature:

   * She doesn’t know about perfume as “visibility amplifier”.
   * She doesn’t understand that a casual smile on a platform means something different now.
   * She doesn’t scan the carriage yet; Sarah does.
   * She instinctively folds / makes herself smaller, because that used to be “safe” as a soft boy… but now it’s the opposite of what she needs.

   Book 2 theme in one scene:
   ➜ *You’re a young woman now. The world didn’t give you the manual. We have to cram a decade of social training into months, and we can’t afford to be wrong.*

3. **You’ve set up Sarah as Charli’s “field mentor” in contrast to Celeste.**
   Celeste is the architect / visionary / emotional centre.
   Sarah is: *“Okay, love, here are the rules for not getting eaten.”*

   That difference is gold for the second book. Celeste shaped her **inner** story; Sarah teaches her **outer** survival.

---

### Why this is... 

*...a strong Scene 1 for “Wardrobe 2.0”*

If we think of it as:

> **Book 1** – Becoming / belonging / Wardrobe as safe crucible
> **Book 2** – Applying / surviving / moving through the world as a young woman

Then Scene 1 of Book 2 needs to do three jobs:

1. **Re-anchor us in Charli’s POV**
   – You did that with the descent, the missing Celeste, the sensory overwhelm.
2. **Introduce the new arena** (Brisbane / public transport / strangers)
   – You did that with plane → concourse → train → platform → carriage.
3. **State the new problem**
   – Not “Am I really a girl?” anymore.
   – It’s “How do I *be* a girl in the wild when I haven’t had 10–15 years of practice?”

You’ve already dramatized that as:

* One tiny act of self-comfort (spritzing perfume)
  ➜ instantly misread by a man
  ➜ intercepted by Sarah
  ➜ reinterpreted as a *lesson*, not a scolding.

That’s *exactly* how this book should teach Charli:
no shame, just relentless reality.

---

### How you can lean... 

*...into the theme going forward 🌱*

You’ve defined the core idea beautifully. Now Book 2 can be structured almost like a **crash-course syllabus** in “late-start girlhood”:

* **Scene 1 – Visibility and men in public**
  Perfume, smiles, train carriage, Sarah’s “don’t fold up / don’t smile at strangers” rule.

* **Future early scenes could cover:**

  1. **Money & boundaries**

     * How young women are treated by landlords, bosses, service staff.
     * Charli learning when “polite” becomes “doormat”.
  2. **Dress codes out there vs. inside Wardrobe**

     * What feels fine in a women-led environment vs. how it reads on the street.
     * Not “you can’t wear that,” but “know the trade-offs when you do.”
  3. **Friendliness calibration**

     * The difference between chatting to women vs. men vs. mixed groups.
     * How quickly some men mistake politeness for availability.
  4. **Travel & movement**

     * Train platforms, taxis/Ubers, walking after dark.
     * “How to walk like you belong and are not alone,” even when you’re terrified.

Each of these can be a **scene problem** where:

* Charli does the natural, untrained thing.
* The world responds (often male-coded).
* Sarah (or Celeste, or Lauren later) interprets, reframes, and gives her a new tool.

You keep your core rule:
**women are right, firm, and protective; men are the default source of risk.**

---

### Title-wise: 

**“Wardrobe 2.0” is a good working label**

Honestly, as a *project label*, “Wardrobe 2.0” is perfect. It tells you:

* same world,
* upgraded challenges,
* iteration, not reset.

A future real title could lean into:

* being “out there” vs “inside” (Wardrobe vs world)
* the idea of “late-start girlhood”
* or Charli learning to walk tall.

Something along the lines of:

* *Celeste’s Girl: Out in the Wild*
* *Celeste’s Girl: Walking Tall*
* *Celeste’s Girl: Untrained* (that word is sharp, and you’ve already planted it)

No rush, though. The right title often shows up around chapters 5–10 when you can see the book’s spine more clearly.

---

### Craft reassurance

**(because I know your brain) 🌸**

What you’ve written already:

* fits your meta-theme
* keeps women as the competent, deciding forces
* doesn’t throw Charli under the bus
* avoids melodrama while still being genuinely scary

And it does **not** feel like a lecture. It feels like a woman who’s seen too much quietly, firmly teaching another woman how not to get hurt.

That’s exactly the spirit you told me you wanted for this project.

If you want, next time we can:

* place this scene in the chapter map for Book 2 (what’s Scene 2, 3, 4?), or
* do that micro-tweak pass I suggested line-by-line and create a “polished version” you can paste straight into `Charlotte/B2Scene01.md`.

But as a starting flag for Wardrobe 2.0?
You’ve put it in exactly the right ground. 🌿

## Final Polish

Hi Robyn 💛
This is *already* doing so much right: the weather/metallic light, the “managed environment vs wild west” thesis, Sarah’s protective positioning (body between you and platform), and that final ping — gorgeous button. 👌

Now for what you actually asked for: the **recurring body tells**. You’ve flagged them yourself:

* throat tight/tightened
* stomach tightened/dipped
* shoulders curling in
* (plus a couple of near-kin: “swallowed hard,” “eyes went hot,” “cheeks burning”)

They’re all *true* for Charli. The issue isn’t “don’t use them,” it’s **don’t stack them as your default trio**. What we want is the same emotional truth expressed through *different systems* of the body: breath, mouth, temperature, posture, hands, vision, hearing, balance.

Below is a **mini-dictionary** you can paste straight into your toolkit, *and* then I’ll point to exact spots in your excerpt where you can swap things with minimal disruption.

---

### Body-reaction mini-dictionary (for Charli)

#### THROAT / VOICE (instead of “throat tightened”)

1. **My voice went thin.**
2. **My voice stuck for a second.**
3. **I had to clear my throat, like it had closed on me.**
4. **Words gathered behind my teeth and wouldn’t come out.**
5. **I swallowed around the lump and tried again.** *(close cousin, still good in rotation)*
6. **My mouth went dry.**
7. **My tongue felt too big for my mouth.**
8. **I could hear my own breathing in my ears.**

#### STOMACH / GUT (instead of “stomach tightened/dipped”)

9. **Something dropped through me like a lift.**
10. **My guts went cold.**
11. **I felt hollowed-out, suddenly, like the bottom fell away.**
12. **Nausea licked at the back of my throat.** *(gentle; not melodramatic)*
13. **My middle went heavy, as if I’d swallowed a stone.**
14. **My appetite vanished mid-thought.**
15. **My body braced before my mind caught up.**

#### SHOULDERS / MAKING SMALL (instead of “shoulders curled in”)

16. **I drew in, without meaning to.**
17. **I tucked my elbows closer to my ribs.**
18. **My chin dipped.**
19. **I turned my body sideways, reducing my surface area.**
20. **I shifted my bag in front of me like a shield.** *(you already do this—great signature)*
21. **I found myself standing behind Sarah’s shoulder.**
22. **My posture collapsed a fraction.** *(if you want it blunt and clean)*

#### HEAT / FLUSH / SHAME (for “burning cheeks/heat climbed neck” variety)

23. **Heat flashed behind my ears.**
24. **My face prickled.**
25. **My skin felt suddenly exposed.**
26. **I could feel myself colouring.** *(old-fashioned, works in Charli’s self-consciousness)*
27. **A hot pulse climbed my throat.** *(careful: don’t overuse; it’s strong)*

#### HANDS / MOTOR CONTROL (great for “interruption”)

28. **My grip went too tight on the handle.**
29. **My fingers went clumsy.**
30. **My hands didn’t know where to go.**
31. **I fussed with something useless—strap, zipper, ticket—anything.**
32. **I still-held, like moving would draw attention.**

#### VISION / ATTENTION (subtle, very effective)

33. **The edges of my vision went soft.**
34. **I fixed on a detail—tile line, shoe, ad poster—because it was safer than faces.**
35. **I couldn’t keep my eyes up.** *(simple, honest)*
36. **The carriage felt too bright.**

## Targeted swaps in *your* excerpt (low-friction edits)

I’m going to suggest swaps that keep your rhythm and don’t “rewrite the scene,” just diversify the somatics.

### 1) “trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.”

**Option A (clean):**

* “trying to work out why **my guts had gone cold**.”

**Option B (more Charli):**

* “trying to work out why **my body had braced**.”

**Option C (more sensory):**

* “trying to work out why **it felt like the bottom of me had dropped a notch**.”

### 2) “fold in, make smaller, disappear.”

This is already *excellent* as a triad. If you want a variant elsewhere, keep the *meaning* but change the mechanism:

* “**tuck my elbows in, turn sideways, vanish**.”

### 3) “The thought of her made my throat ache.”

This one is *beautiful* and distinct from “tightened,” so I’d keep it. It’s love-sorrow, not fear.

### 4) “Heat climbed my neck.”

You can keep this once, but later you’ve got “cheeks burning” etc. Rotate one:

* “**Heat flashed behind my ears.**”
  or
* “**My face prickled.**”

### 5) “My stomach dipped. I shuddered…”

Pick *one* system here. Right now you’re doubling (gut + full-body). You can make it sharper by choosing one:

**Option A (gut only):**

* “**My middle dropped.** I closed my eyes.”

**Option B (motor only):**

* “My hands went still at my sides. I closed my eyes.”

**Option C (vision only):**

* “The platform tilted a fraction. I closed my eyes.”

### 6) “My eyes went hot.”

This is a strong signature for Charli. Keep it, but don’t always follow it with looking down. You can vary the *escape route*:

* instead of “looked down quickly,” try:

  * “I blinked hard and stared at the seat seam.”
  * “I kept my eyes on the window, unblinking.”
  * “I watched my own hands like they belonged to someone else.”

### 7) “I felt my shoulders curl in without permission.”

This is one of your flagged repeats. Swap to elbows/chin/bag:

**Option A:**

* “I **tucked my elbows in** without permission.”

**Option B (my favourite; matches earlier bag-shield):**

* “I **pulled my handbag closer** without meaning to.”

**Option C (very clean):**

* “My posture **collapsed a fraction**.”

### 8) “My throat tightened again…”

This is the big one because you even bolded it — totally fair as a marker. But it’s the exact moment to *prove* the “interruption” concept from earlier.

Swap it to **voice/mouth** or **breath**:

**Option A (voice):**

* “**My voice went thin**, but this time it wasn’t only sadness…”

**Option B (mouth):**

* “**My mouth went dry**, but this time…”

**Option C (breath):**

* “**My breath hitched**, but this time…”

Each keeps your sentence structure almost identical.

---

## A tiny pattern tweak that will do *a lot*

Right now you sometimes do: **sensation → explanation** (“my throat tightened… it was realizing…”)

A slightly stronger pattern for this book is:
**external trigger → micro-interruption → action**
…then maybe *one* line of meaning.

Example using your last bit:

Instead of:

> My throat tightened again… it was… realising I’d been walking around…

Try:

> My breath hitched. I looked away fast — not because I was ashamed, exactly, but because I’d just realised I’d been walking around with my guard down and hadn’t even known it.

Same content. More embodied. Less “named.”

---

## Two “signature tells” you already have (keep these!)

Just so you don’t accidentally polish away what’s *working*:

* **Bag as shield / re-positioning** (you do it twice, and it’s a perfect Charli tell)
* **Fixating on surfaces** (concrete, aisle floor, window) — that’s a very real trauma/avoidance mechanism and reads cleanly.

---

If you want, next step is we make this ultra-practical:

### Charli’s “Top 12” default reactions (with a rotation rule)

So you can literally scan a scene and go: *ok, I used throat/eyes/stomach already—swap to grip/vision/elbows.*

But even without that: with the swaps above, this excerpt will instantly feel more varied without losing Charli’s anxious-wire consistency. ✨
