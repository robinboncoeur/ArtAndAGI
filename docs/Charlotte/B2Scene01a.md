### **Emily's Take**

This is *not* bland. This is you doing the hard bit: getting a scene onto the page with the right bones **and** a sensory baseline. That’s the win. 🤍😄

You’ve also done something even more important: you’ve written **enough** that we can now see where the power shifts want to land. Now we refine.

I’ll do three things:

1. Evaluate against the framework (you stayed on rails)
2. Point out the few places it goes “travelogue” and how to tighten
3. Give you a **second-pass rewrite** (same events, more Charli, more punch, less explanation), so you can see the difference

---

1) Framework Check — You’re On Rails ✅

**Entry position:** homesick numbness + Sarah braced ✅
**Inciting preambles:** bag + jostle ✅
**Primary inciting incident:** perfume + man notices ✅ (excellent)
**Internal calibration:** embarrassment + new awareness starting ✅
**Choice:** shrink (lip bite, eyes down, retreat) ✅
**Power adjustment:** *almost* — Sarah acts, Charli mostly retreats (we’ll add one micro-win)
**Exit note:** you stop at “Sarah steered us…” which is fine for the excerpt; later you’ll do Landsborough smile ✅

So structurally: good.

---

2) Where to Tighten (No big surgery, just sharpening)

A) Cut “airport logistics” that aren’t doing character work

Example: “Fiona apologises…” / train to Landsborough.
This is fine *if* it matters emotionally (e.g., Charli hoping Celeste might have changed plans). But right now it reads like itinerary.

**Rule:** if a logistical detail doesn’t change emotion or power, compress it.

B) Replace “telling” sentences with body/sensory cues

You do this well in the perfume section. Earlier sections still slip into summary:

* “Something about the whole thing seemed unusual”
* “Sarah seemed a bit distracted”
* “People were crowding from all sides”

Those can be made more Charli-by-body with small swaps.

C) Sarah’s voice needs to be drier / more economical

Sarah saying “Thanks for the offer, mate,” is great.
But the “Did you notice… / never mind” moment could be sharper. Sarah isn’t coy; she’s controlled. She’d likely bank it, then deliver it later.

D) Add Charli’s **micro-win** before the perfume incident

Right now Sarah is doing all the steering.

Give Charli one *tiny* action that shows learning is beginning. For example:

* She notices Sarah placing herself between Charli and the aisle.
* She shifts to copy Sarah’s stance.
* She turns her body so her bag is in front, not behind.
* She stops smiling reflexively at a stranger (or catches herself mid-smile).

One small behaviour = growth.

---

3) Second-Pass Rewrite (Same scene, more punch, less travelogue)

I’ll keep your overall flow and tone, but tighten, add sensory, and ensure Charli stays inside her body. Consider this a “Pass 2 template” you can steal from shamelessly. 🖤

### Her Version

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if it had finally stopped pretending to be heavy. My heart did a flip — and then… nothing. Not excitement. Not relief. Just a numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wing flaps shuddered and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped through grey cloud and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow someone else’s steadiness.

Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money. Her mouth was a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway — that solid, honest *thump* — I felt her grip loosen. Not much. Just enough to tell me she was human.

Rain smeared the windows into watercolour. The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. We’ll train it.”

I nodded like that meant something. My legs were stiff when I stood — my bum numb from the seat — and I rubbed at the ache without thinking, then caught myself, suddenly aware of my own body in a public aisle.

Sarah lifted her carry-on down in one smooth motion. I reached for mine and my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

“Need a hand?”

A young man leaned in, all sunburnt neck and an eager smile. I smiled back automatically — because I always did — and my mouth was already opening.

“Yes, ple—”

Sarah’s arm went up. My bag came down. Quick, tidy. No fuss.

“Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said, and it was polite enough to pass as friendliness. But she placed herself half a step between us like it was choreography she’d learned years ago.

The young man’s smile faltered. He drifted away.

I stood there with my bag suddenly heavy in my hand, trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.

We moved through the concourse at Sarah’s pace: brisk, purposeful, not looking at anyone long enough to invite a conversation. She didn’t hold my hand. She didn’t hover. She just… stayed close, like she was quietly filling the space other people might try to step into.

At the first train, it was packed. Heat and damp wool and the sour tang of travel sweat. Bodies pressed in, shoulders brushing, someone’s backpack zip scraping my arm. I planted my feet in the doorway area, bag hanging off one shoulder, and felt the old instinct tug at me — fold in, make smaller, disappear.

Sarah’s hand landed at my elbow. Firm. A correction, not a comfort.

She shifted me to the side, away from the open aisle, and I copied her without thinking — turned my body so my bag was in front of me, not behind. It was a tiny thing. But it made me feel less… accessible.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face. Not praise. Just acknowledgement.

At Eagle Junction, the platform heat hit like opening an oven. Concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Other platform,” the man said. “Half an hour.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for my card and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider and there it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

J’Adore.

My heart did the flip again, but this time it *landed* somewhere. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to lean into — like the scent could make a bridge across distance.

I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. Plastic and memory. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then — without thinking — I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me — too close, too casual, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could swallow me.

Sarah didn’t glare. She didn’t snap. Her face went cool in the way a door goes shut.

She stepped in front of me. Ordinary. Practised. Like it was nothing.

The train screamed into the station.

Sarah touched my elbow — firm, guiding — and steered us toward a carriage with space, her body between mine and the platform, like it was the most normal thing in the world.

### Post-Op Notes

**What This Rewrite Changes**

* Keeps your events, but trims logistics that don’t pull emotional weight
* Makes Sarah’s protection feel *trained*, not dramatic
* Adds Charli’s **micro-win** (bag in front / copying Sarah’s stance)
* Keeps it sensory without purple prose
* Keeps Charli soft but not foolish

---

**Your Next Move (small and doable)**

Write the next section on the train in the same manner:

* one jostle
* one Sarah correction
* one Charli calibration
* one micro-action by Charli
* one low, dry line from Sarah (“Perfume carries.” / “Stop smiling at strangers.”)

When you paste that, we’ll shape it into the “silence as refusal” seed.

Want me to give you 5 Sarah one-liners that teach without lecturing? 😄


<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">
    











## On The Train (Emily)

[26-02-23]

You’re not “struggling,” — you’re doing the hard, correct work: you’ve got **the right content**, but the **delivery is drifting into explanation** and Sarah is starting to sound like a teacher giving a safety lecture. That’s why it feels sticky. 🤍😄

The fix is not “more words.” It’s **more scene**.

Right now you have:

* Good setup
* Good emotional truth (Celeste absence + perfume trigger)
* Good stakes (visibility and danger)
* BUT: too many abstract statements (“here’s the deal… girls grow up learning… bullseye…”)

We can keep everything you want while making it *feel* like Sarah and *feel* like Charli learning in her body.

Below I’ll do three things:

1. Quick diagnosis (what to keep / what to adjust)
2. Give you **Sarah quips** that teach without lecturing
3. Offer a **rewritten version** that preserves your beats but fixes tone + punch + voice

---

1) Diagnosis: What’s working / what’s tripping you

✅ Keep

* “How’re you travelling, Charli?” (Sarah opening gentle)
* Charli’s homesickness crowding out awareness
* Wrist-smell triggering the platform memory (excellent sensory bridge)
* Sarah catching herself when she’s too blunt (“unfair of me”) — very Sarah
* The central idea: Wardrobe ≠ outside world

⚠️ Adjust

A) Remove “deep end / learn to swim quick”

It’s a bit coachy/cutesy for Sarah. She can be warm, but she’s dry. She’d choose something flatter.

B) Cut the “here’s the deal” lecture structure

Sarah doesn’t *announce* she’s explaining. She just says the necessary line and lets it land.

C) Reduce generalisations (“girls grow up learning…”)

It’s true, but it becomes essay. Sarah would do *one specific example* and let Charli infer the rest.

D) Give Charli one micro-action

She needs a small behavioural shift **during the conversation**, not only understanding in words.

---

2) Sarah quips (dry, unmistakably her, non-lecture)

Pick 1–2 only, not all.

* “Stop smiling at strangers. It reads like permission.”
* “Perfume carries. So do you.”
* “Wardrobe isn’t the world. Out here, you don’t get the benefit of decent women nearby.”
* “You don’t need to be scared. You need to be awake.”
* “If something feels off, that’s your cue. Not your imagination.”
* “Don’t apologise. Just move.”
* “You’re not in trouble. You’re just… untrained.”

Those feel like Sarah: blunt kindness, no melodrama.

---

3) Rewrite (same scene, more Charli, more Sarah, less lecture)

I’m going to keep Charli’s softness and impressionability. I’ll also keep Sarah’s warmth, but make it *dry warmth*, not pastoral.

---





**Train Scene — Charli POV, past tense, sensory, with one micro-win**

The carriage was loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Plastic bags. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. I stared out the window and tried to keep my face neutral, like I belonged here.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if looking at me for too long might make me cry.

Eventually the crowd thinned. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. What was left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said, and then, because it was true and it was sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged, but the shrug came out small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing — crowded, constant — like there wasn’t room left for anything else.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly, pretending to fuss with the strap of my bag.

And then I lifted my hand to my face and the smell hit me — *J’Adore*, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there — and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

Love.

My stomach dipped.

Sarah watched me for a second, then looked away on purpose, giving me privacy without making a show of it. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “We need to talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. “About… perfume?”

“About you,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed — I could tell she noticed — because her hand came down gently on my forearm, not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said.

“Do what?”

“Fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “You don’t have to make yourself smaller to be safe.”

My cheeks burned. I hated that she could see it happening.

Sarah sighed once, the smallest sound. “Listen. Wardrobe is… a managed environment. Women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here, you don’t get that.”

I didn’t speak. The train rattled, the windows shivering in their frames.

She nodded toward my wrist — not touching it. Not making it intimate. Just indicating.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “So do smiles. So does being polite when you don’t mean yes.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out.

Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree. “You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

Untrained.

The word landed oddly. Not cruel. Not kind. Just accurate.

I looked down at my hands. Then — slowly — I moved my bag in front of me, the way Sarah had earlier. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too. She didn’t comment. That was the comment.

I stared out at the gum trees flashing past and tried to make my brain do two things at once: miss Celeste, and still be here.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “First thing?”

I waited.

“Stop smiling at strangers,” she said. “If you want to be friendly, be friendly on purpose. Not by reflex.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t only sadness. It was something else — the sharp, uncomfortable feeling of realising I’d been walking around with my guard down because I didn’t know I had one.

---

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not just out the window. At the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

Sarah had only touched the surface. I could tell that now. There was more she hadn’t said — not because she didn’t want to, but because she didn’t want to drown me in it all at once.

I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again.

For a second it twisted — platform, voice behind me — and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean her.

---

**Why this works better**

* Sarah teaches through **specifics** (perfume carries, smiles, folding up) not a lecture
* Charli learns through **body** (shoulders curling, bag moved in front)
* You get “silence as refusal” implied (don’t be polite when you don’t mean yes)
* The emotional core (missing Celeste) stays present without taking over

---

**What you can steal back into your version**

Even if you don’t use my wording, keep these structural tricks:

✅ “Sarah looks away on purpose” = care without softness
✅ “Don’t do that.” / “Do what?” = teaching without sermon
✅ One micro-win: moving bag / adjusting stance
✅ Replace generalisations with one concrete rule: “Stop smiling at strangers.”

---

If you want, paste your next attempt after you revise using just **two changes**:

1. remove the lecture paragraph (“girls grow up learning…”)
2. add one micro-win (bag in front / stance shift / silence)

…and we’ll lock it in. 🤍

## Emily, Assembled

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

[26-02-23]

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if it had finally stopped pretending to be heavy. My heart did a flip — and then… nothing. Not excitement. Not relief. Just a numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wing flaps shuddered and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped through grey cloud and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow someone else’s steadiness.

The carriage was loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Plastic bags. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. I stared out the window and tried to keep my face neutral, like I belonged here.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if looking at me for too long might make me cry.

Eventually the crowd thinned. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. What was left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said, and then, because it was true and it was sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged, but the shrug came out small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing — crowded, constant — like there wasn’t room left for anything else.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly, pretending to fuss with the strap of my bag.

And then I lifted my hand to my face and the smell hit me — *J’Adore*, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there — and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

Love.

My stomach dipped.

Sarah watched me for a second, then looked away on purpose, giving me privacy without making a show of it. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “We need to talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. “About… perfume?”

“About you,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed — I could tell she noticed — because her hand came down gently on my forearm, not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said.

“Do what?”

“Fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “You don’t have to make yourself smaller to be safe.”

My cheeks burned. I hated that she could see it happening.

Sarah sighed once, the smallest sound. “Listen. Wardrobe is… a managed environment. Women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here, you don’t get that.”

I didn’t speak. The train rattled, the windows shivering in their frames.

She nodded toward my wrist — not touching it. Not making it intimate. Just indicating.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “So do smiles. So does being polite when you don’t mean yes.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out.

Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree. “You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

Untrained.

The word landed oddly. Not cruel. Not kind. Just accurate.

I looked down at my hands. Then — slowly — I moved my bag in front of me, the way Sarah had earlier. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too. She didn’t comment. That was the comment.

I stared out at the gum trees flashing past and tried to make my brain do two things at once: miss Celeste, and still be here.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “First thing?”

I waited.

“Stop smiling at strangers,” she said. “If you want to be friendly, be friendly on purpose. Not by reflex.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t only sadness. It was something else — the sharp, uncomfortable feeling of realising I’d been walking around with my guard down because I didn’t know I had one.

---

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not just out the window. At the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

Sarah had only touched the surface. I could tell that now. There was more she hadn’t said — not because she didn’t want to, but because she didn’t want to drown me in it all at once.

I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again.

For a second it twisted — platform, voice behind me — and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean *her*.
