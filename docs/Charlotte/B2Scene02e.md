### 26-03-01

**(same beats, more sensory, more Celeste)**

I’m keeping your structure and most of your actions; I’m just tightening phrasing, fixing tense drift, and making Celeste’s interior more bodily and less explanatory.

A tightened pass (same beats, more sensory, more Celeste)

I’m keeping your structure and most of your actions; I’m just tightening phrasing, fixing tense drift, and making Celeste’s interior more bodily and less explanatory.

---

Beat 1 — Entry

The front-door lock was too loud in the tiny hallway. When I pulled the door shut, the quiet inside the flat didn’t settle — it judged.

I tried to sigh the tension out of my ribs. It stayed put.

Kettle on. Tea. There was always tea.

It was just for a month.

I threw my bag into the corner like it had offended me and folded myself onto the couch with my lecture notes. The lines swam. I kept rereading the same sentence as if the page had been swapped while I blinked.

I checked my phone, then checked it again, irritated at it like it had lied to me. I was sure I’d been “studying” for longer than ten minutes.

Sarah had texted 7:30 pm.

It was 6:30.

My thumb hovered, then I hit call before I could bargain with myself. The phone sang its inane little tune. When Charli’s face came up on the screen, my breath sped up — stupidly, instantly — like my body was a dog that had heard a familiar car pull into the driveway.

Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)

Then my stomach dropped. Not far. Just enough.

Her smile was there, but it was held too tight. Her eyes weren’t cooperating.

“Hey, sweetie…” I heard myself start, soft and careful.

Her lower lip trembled.

“Hi, Celeste,” she said, barely above a whisper.

“How was the flight?” I asked, bright on purpose.

She nodded too fast and swallowed. “Okay.”

The pause did the talking.

And then, quietly: “I really miss you.”

Something pinched behind my cheekbones. I kept my mouth steady.

“I miss you too,” I said. “Sarah told me Queensland’s… different.”

Charli nodded. A small grin tried to form.

“Smelly-different,” she said. “Lots of people smoke. And deodorant. And perfume…”
She stopped.

I tipped my head. “Perfume?”

Her face went careful. Like she’d put a lid on herself. She bit her lip and finally looked at me like I might snap.

“I…” She swallowed again. “I screwed up today, Celeste. Like—so bad.”

“How?” The word came out clean, but my hands had tightened on the phone. She was shrinking — the old Charlie shape — and it made something in me go hard and protective at the same time.

“Charli.” I kept my voice level. “Listen to me. Are you allowed to make mistakes?”

She blinked, offended by the question. “Not epic ones like this.”

“Alright.” I exhaled through my nose. “Is anyone hurt?”

“No.”

“Good.”
I let that land. “Then we’re in the category of: human. Not disaster. Tell me what happened.”

The words came in a rush — finding the perfume vial, how it reminded her of me so sharply it hurt, how she’d clung to that memory and then—how it had been spoiled. Her voice thinned. When she looked back at me, her eyes were wet.

I pressed my lips together, tasting the restraint.

“You know what the name means,” I said.

Her throat worked. “I adore…”

“And I do.” My voice softened, but I didn’t let it wobble. “I adore you.”
I lifted my chin a fraction. “Tonight, wear my perfume to bed.”

Her eyes widened.

“And tonight,” I added, “I’m going to wear your t-shirt. I want the smell of you here.”

She stared at me as if she’d misheard. A tiny twitch ran through her head — the start of a nod that didn’t trust itself.

“Really?”

“Yes.” I blinked hard once and kept my gaze steady. “Really.”

I drew a breath I could feel all the way to my pelvis and held it there for a beat.

“What are you doing tomorrow?”

“Sarah and I are going to meet Fiona’s girls—” she corrected herself quickly, “her staff. We did the site visit. It’s still not ready. Tradies everywhere. We didn’t want to get in the way, so we didn’t stay long.”

“Did Fiona say when the crates arrive?”

“Day after tomorrow.” Her smile eased a little. “She’s really nice. Sort of like Mum, in a way.”

“Have you eaten?”

Charli shook her head.

“Then do that next.” My tone left no room for negotiation. “Even if it’s a banana. Promise me.”

“I promise.” Her voice steadied. “I feel better now, just because…”

“Good.”
I didn’t smile, not fully — I let my eyes do it instead. “Fruit. Shower. Perfume. Sleep. Tomorrow: be in your space. You’ve got a lot to offer. Focus on that.”

She nodded with each phrase, taking it in like I’d handed her a list that would keep the world from collapsing.

“I love you, Charli,” I said.

It landed oddly in my mouth — too naked. I’d never said it to her face-to-face. Only in the quiet parts of my head.

Her gaze held mine, deep and dark.

“I love you too, Celeste.”

Beat 3 — Internal Calibration

The phone sat warm on my lap, suddenly heavy.

## Structure 2nd Go

<img src="/assets/images/emily/260219ab.jpg" style="float: right; width: 540px; margin-left: 20px" />

[ *Celeste* ]
**Beat 1 — Entry**

Unlocking the front door to our little flat made a "You're in the wrong home" click. The silence was as bad as an accusation.

Celeste's breath comes quicker as Charli's face appears on screen. 

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

Then, her stomach sinks: his smile is telling untruths, his body betrays the smile. His happiness over the perfume has a wobbly edge he seems intent on hiding.

**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

(Later, when Sarah and Charli share day's challenges. Celeste realises Charli is less equipped as woman in public spaces than she thought.) Celeste speaks slowly, cautiously. "Did we screw up? Are we pushing her too fast?"

Sarah: "Look, I figured there would be little gaffs like this. How is she to know? She'll pick it up-she's quick." Sarah wore the same smile she did when Mara put her on sorting pins: "What, me worry?"
Celeste feels herself tighten anyway. Asks: "Is this too much for her?" An ache in the jaw reminds her that we do not train by ambush. 

**Beat 4 — Choice**

Earlier, Charli's smile had appeared a fraction of a second late, as if prompted. Celeste wonders if it's homesickness or... when she asks Charli what she thought of the trip, Charli looks down, biting her lip. Celeste's smile freezes as her eyebrows slowly rise. Charli hides behind: "I did a few stupid things and... I just miss you..." and a tear runs down her cheek. 

**Beat 5 — Power Adjustment (TURN)**

Chatting to Sarah, they both speak briskly at first, confidently. Business at hand: initial site visit shared. The ache Celeste felt eases. Sarah touches on Charli's little challenges with an off-handed grin and a wink. "She'll be fine, Celeste. Just for a month." Celeste's look is sharp, so Sarah adds: "Got an idea. Charli needs someone her own age to bring her up to speed." Celeste feels a loosening in her shoulders the more she talks to Sarah, agrees with Sarah's ideas. Sarah and Celeste (privately) discuss transphobia, need for mentoring. Sarah has an idea: age-contemporary mentoring. Sarah would vet for transphobic inclinations.

**Beat 6 — Exit Note**

The tightness in Celeste chest is still there, but for a different reason. "I won't have my beautiful woman to cuddle tonight." She allows herself to cry, softly.
Scene ends.

**Facial**
He surprised his face with a wide smile.
Her smile melted slowly.
Her smile froze as her look sharpened.
She held her slowly fracturing smile a little longer.
Her mouth was asking her eyes fo permission to smile.
Her mouth fell slowly open, as if unattended.

**Body**
His head snapped back as he frowned.
She pulled her chin into the air, her eyes narrowing.
His eyelids slid shut under their own weight.
An involuntary chuckle almost made it out into the open.
She bit a thoughtful fingernail.

**Beat 1 — Entry**

The lock to the front door to our little flat was too loud, and then after I closed the door, the silence felt like an accusation. I tried a sigh to undo the tightness in my body. It didn't work. Flicked on the kettle—there's always tea.

It's just for a month.

I threw my bag into a corner and curled up on the couch with my lecture notes. They made as much sense as if someone else had scribbled them. 

I stared at my phone, wondering if my phone was defective. I was sure I'd been 'studying' for longer than ten minutes.


Sarah has texted seven-thirty pm. It was six thirty. The phone sang an inane song as I dialled. I felt my breath come quicker as Charli's face appears on screen. 

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

And then, my stomach sank a little. Her smile was a bit pinched, her eyes  betraying her lips.

"Hey, sweetie..." I began.

Her lower lip quivered.

"Hi Celeste," she said softly.

"How was the flight?" I asked with forced cheeriness.

She nodded quickly and swallowed.

"Okay." The pause told me more than her words. Then, softly: "I really miss you."

My smile tightened, even while my eyes softened.

"I miss you too, sweetie..." I managed. I forced myself to move to neutral ground. "Sarah texted me that Queensland's very different."

Charli nodded, a little grin forming.

"Smelly-different. Lots of people smoke. And deodorant and perfume..." She paused. I cocked my head, eyebrows flicked up. Charli's face was suddenly a mask.

"Perfume?" I prompted gently.

Her face fell as she bit her lip. Finally, she looked cautiously at me.

"I..." She swallowed. "I screwed up today, Celeste. Like, so bad..."

"How?" She was shrinking into herself again, the Charlie of old. "Charli, tell me something," I said clearly. "Do you think you're not allowed to make mistakes?"

"Not epic ones like this one!"

"Did someone die? Were any animals hurt by this? Or is this a mistake that could have happened to anyone, of any age, but it just so happens it was you who made it?" Her jaw was tight. "Did you think you wouldn't make any mistakes?"

A tear formed in her eye. Words burbled out about finding the perfume vial, how much she missed me, how the perfume so reminded her of me and then, how that memory was spoilt. Her voice faltered as she finally looked at me again. I pressed my lips together.

"You do know what the name of the perfume means, don't you?"

"I adore..." she croaked.

"And I do. I adore you, Charli. Tonight, wear my perfume to bed." I pushed the unwilling corners of my mouth up. "And tonight, I'm going to wear your t-shirt, so I can smell you. Because, as much as you miss me, I miss you more."

She stared wordlessly at me. Finally, her head did a little twitch.

"Really?"

I nodded quickly, flicking away a disobedient tear. I gripped the phone and forced a deep breath.

"What are you doing tomorrow?" I said.

"Sarah and I are going to meet Fiona's girls... I mean, her staff." The name 'Sarah' popped up above his head. "We've done the site visit: it's still not ready. Tradies everywhere. We didn't want to get in the way so we soft-of didn't stay long."

"Did Fiona have any updates on when the crates arrive?"

"Day after tomorrow, she said." Her smile softened. "She's really nice... sort-of like mum, in a way."

"Have you eaten?"

Charli shook her head.

"Please do, Charli. Even if it's just a piece of fruit. promise me you will."

"I promise. I feel better now, just because..." My head bobbed. I felt the same way.

"Fruit. Shower. Perfume. Sleep. And tomorrow, be you, be in your space. You have a lot to offer... focus on that."

She nodded with each syllable, absorbing my words as if I were the Dalai Lama.

"I love you, Charli."

It seemed odd to say that now: I'd never said it to her, face to face. Her eyes were deep and dark.

"I love you too, Celeste."


**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

The phone sat on my lap, warm and quiet. realises Charli is less equipped as woman in public spaces than she thought.) Celeste speaks slowly, cautiously. "Did we screw up? Are we pushing her too fast?"

Sarah: "Look, I figured there would be little gaffs like this. How is she to know? She'll pick it up-she's quick." Sarah wore the same smile she did when Mara put her on sorting pins: "What, me worry?"
