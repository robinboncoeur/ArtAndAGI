## Scene Start

<img src="/assets/images/emily/260219ab.jpg" style="float: right; width: 540px; margin-left: 20px" />


**Beat 1 — Entry**

Charli inside her head (homesick), Sarah sharp and scanning.

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

Man offers to handle Charli’s bag; Sarah intercepts. Charli registers: *Oh. That’s a thing.*

**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

Charli feels the heat of being perceived. Realises she’s been mentally elsewhere. The world is closer than she thought.

**Beat 4 — Choice**

Charli shrinks (physically moves behind Sarah / lets Sarah speak).

**Beat 5 — Power Adjustment (TURN)**

Later, in the crush of the train, Charli catches something first (a hand too close / a man pressing in / a stare). She adjusts position *without waiting*.

Sarah clocks it. Doesn’t praise. Just… accepts it.

**Beat 6 — Exit Note**

The smile at Landsborough. Charli smiles back automatically — then feels the risk of that reflex. Not fear. Awareness.

[ *Charli* ]

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if the captain was pumping the brakes. I felt a hard thud in my chest—and then… nothing. Emptiness. A numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here*.

The wings flexed, shouldering us through the cloud. We dipped under the clouds and raindrops streaked along the window. The cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat, and the light went flat and metallic.

I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow steadiness from someone else. Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money and an apology… her mouth, a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway—that solid, honest thump—and the engines roared at the rain, I felt her grip loosen. Not much, just enough to allow breathing to resume.

Rain had smeared the windows into watercolour.

The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. Never-mind: we’ll take the train.”

My body felt a little stiff when I stood, my bum numb from the seat, and I rubbed at the ache without thinking, then caught myself, suddenly aware of the public aisle.

Sarah lifted her carry-on down in one smooth motion. I reached for mine but my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

“Need a hand?”

A young man leaned in, all sunburnt neck and eager smile. I smiled back automatically—because, why not—my mouth already opening.

“Yes, ple—”

Sarah’s arm went up. My bag came down. Quick, tidy, handle in my hand.

“Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said. It was polite enough to pass as friendliness.

The young man’s smile faltered. I looked at the aisle floor with my luggage handle suddenly feeling awkward in my hand, trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.

We moved through the concourse at Sarah’s pace: brisk. Sarah's eyes were straight in front of her, purposeful, not looking at anyone. Signs. Doors. Escalators. She didn’t hold my hand or hover, but just… stayed close, as if intent on filling space between us others might try to step into.

The first train was packed and steamy. The rain had stopped, but the damp air combined with heat and damp wool, leaving a sour aftertaste of travel sweat and over-worked deodorant. Bodies pressed in, shoulders brushing, someone’s backpack zip scraped my arm. I planted my feet in the exit area gripping luggage handles, handbag hanging off one shoulder, and felt the old instinct tug at me—fold in, make smaller, disappear.

Sarah’s hand landed at my elbow. Firm. A correction, direction. She shifted to the side, away from the open aisle, and I copied her, turned my body so my bag was in front of me. It was a tiny thing, but it made me feel less… accessible.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, her lips tightened quickly in acknowledgement.

By the time we reached Eagle Junction, the sun had come out. The platform heat hit like opening an oven—drying concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Last platform,” the man said, indicating. “Ten minutes.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for a breath mint and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. There it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

*J’Adore*.

Everything in me leaned towards home, towards a little flat in Torquay, towards *her*. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to melt into. I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then—without thinking—I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said softly, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me—too close, too casual, too familiar, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. Cringing slightly, I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could form a wall around me.

When I glanced at Sarah her lips had tightened again, her face cool in the way a door goes shut. She stepped in front of me as welcome as shade at noon. Practised. Almost... resigned.

The train screamed into the station.

Sarah touched my elbow—firm, guiding—and steered us toward a carriage towards the front of the train, her body between mine and the platform. We darted in, pulling our luggage like reluctant sheep behind us. 

--- 

The carriage was full and loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Conversation still wearing its outside voice. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. 

I stared out the window and arranged my face into commuter neutral.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if she didn't want to provide an explanation.

Eventually the noise softened. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. Left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said with a tiny shrug, and then, because I was sure she could see it sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged again, still small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing—crowded, constant—like there wasn’t room left for anything else. And now, the real world kept crowding in.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly and brought my hand up to rub the back of my neck; it felt like cast iron.

And suddenly, the fragrance—J’Adore, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there—and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

*Love*.

I shuddered, feeling slightly sick, and closed my eyes. When I opened them, Sarah was watching me. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “Perhaps we should talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. Swallowed. Hard. 

“About… perfume?”

“About you, hun,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed—I could tell she noticed, because her hand came down gently on my forearm: not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said. “Don't… fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “This is no time to make yourself smaller.”

I glared at the seat back, my cheeks burning. She could always see it happening. Sarah sighed, a small sound. 

“You were thrown in a bit,” she said. She worried her thumbnail. “Wardrobe’s managed. There are women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here… it’s different.”

I stared at her, didn’t speak. The train rattled, we swayed in our seats. She nodded toward my wrist.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “It travels further than you think. Smiles do too. It’s an easy way to be noticed without meaning to.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out. Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree.

“You weren't to know. You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

*Untrained*.

The word sat wrong, like fabric cut against the grain. I looked down at my hands.

Then—slowly—I pulled my handbag into me. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too.

She didn’t comment.

*That* was her comment.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “Here's what you *don't* do.”

I waited.

“Don't smile at strangers,” she said. “Want to be friendly? Choose who to be friendly to. Not just anyone.”

Something tightened in me again, but this time it wasn’t sadness—it was the uneasy understanding that I’d been walking through things without knowing I should brace.

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not out the window: at the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again. For a second it twisted—platform, voice behind me—and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean *her*.

Just then, Sarah's phone pinged. She glanced down at it and grinned.

"Celeste."
