[**Notes**] 
*Emotional temperature*:  
* Charli is homesick for Celeste, oblivious to surroundings.
* Sarah misses Lauren but is sharp, focused, aware of Charli's naïvité.

*Inciting Shift*:
* On deboarding, a man offers to get Charli's bag down from luggage rack, Sarah intervenes (first of many)
* Purchasing tickets, Charli finds J'Adore, dabs on wrists, scent is noticed by another man
* Jostled in train to Eagle Junction, Sarah intervenes
* Finally, discussion on being aware in public places

*Internal Calibration*:
* Charli had been so busy thinking, she hadn't been in the moment with Sarah
* Lights go on during discussion about staying alert

*Choices*:
* Initially shrinking

*Power Adjustment*:
* Shrinking stopped (need to just be aware)

*Exit Note*:
As they get off the train in Landsborough, a young man smiles at Charli. She doesn't know what to do and automatically smiles back. Still has much to learn.

[One Sentence]
In this scene, Charli becomes aware that being in public means being aware of your surroundings because you are now visible.

## Visible

"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane..."

Although my heart did a flip as the engine noise seemed to quieten, I felt a numbness instead of excitement. 

*How amazing it would be to share this moment with her*. 

The wing flapped vigorously as if trying to get down out of the grey clouds as we bumped and swayed in our seats. I shot Sarah a nervous grin. Her fingers gripped the handle firmly, her lips frozen in a brave thin line. It wasn't until the wheels hit the ground with a reassuring thump that that grip loosened.

The rain on the window obscured the view. The instant the wheels stopped moving some passengers started doing that silly thing where they think that getting out of their seats is going to ensure them getting off the plane faster. Sarah remained immobile, her lips no longer clamped together.

Sarah was looking at her phone.

"Fiona apologises... she won't be able to pick us up here. We'll have to take the train to... Landsborough."

Sarah got out of seat and reached up for her carry-on. I slid out of my seat and stood, my bum a bit achy from sitting so long. I gave it a quick rub and stretched up to retrieve my bag, but it had slid to the back of the overhead luggage thing.

"Can I give you a hand with that?"

A young man with a calico shirt and sunburnt neck was smiling at me, so I smiled back.

"Yes, please..." I started, when Sarah abruptly reached up and pulled down my bag. She shot the young man an expression that faintly resembled a smile.

"Thanks for the offer, mate," she said, placing herself between me and the young man.

Something about the whole thing seemed unusual, but I shrugged it off. Once we got in the concourse, we walked briskly, as if late for an appointment. We found ourselves at the baggage claim in no time. I was focused on our bags, but Sarah seemed a bit distracted. It wasn't until we were hurrying along to the train terminal that she spoke.

"Did you notice..." she asked, interrupting herself at my questioning look.

"Notice what?"

"Never mind," she said quickly. We had only just bought the tickets and gotten on the train when it left. It was full: all seats taken. I stood in the middle of the exit area. People were crowding from all sides. I felt Sarah's hand firmly pull me to the side of the carriage. Her eyes looked tired. The train stopped, and the doors opened, letting more people and hot sticky air in. The air-conditioning did its best to tone down the sour smell of travel-weary bodies but was losing the battle.   

At Eagle Junction, we stepped out of the train onto the hot concrete of the station platform.

"Which way is Landsborough?" I asked the man in a ticket office.

"You need to be on that platform there," he said with a thick accent. "Train leaves in about half an hour." 

"Thank you."

I dug through my purse for the credit card and felt something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider. Next to my credit card was a little white vial.

J’Adore.

My heart did a flip. For a second it was like Celeste was there with me, close enough to lean into. I passed the station master my card wordlessly, staring at the vial as if Celeste's eyes were going to magically appear.

"Miss?" I looked up: a hand with my card accompanied by a rather impatient face. I bit my lip and pocketing my card, retreated to a shady spot to wait for the train, gripping the little white vial as if it was a lifeline.

I wanted her here. I held the little white vial to my face, eyes closed, breathing in plastic and memory, and then—without thinking—sprayed my wrists. Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

I heard Sarah’s intake of breath before I saw her.

“What?” I said, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me—too close, too casual.

Heat climbed into my neck. I dropped my hands to my sides as if I could hide the smell by hiding the skin. Sarah’s look was a bit cold, but it wasn't anger as she positioned herself between me and the platform. I bit my lip and looked at the concrete.

The train screamed into the station. Sarah touched my elbow—firm, guiding—and steered us toward a carriage with space, putting her body between mine and the other people on the platform like it was the most ordinary thing in the world.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">










The carriage was quite noisy for a while. I stared out the window, only occasionally glancing at Sarah, who quickly looked away. Eventually, a lot of passengers left the train and it became almost pleasant, except for that sour smell left behind by someone being very frugal with water usage: clearly not his week for a bath.

The business district look began to turn into gum trees and infrequent houses when Sarah spoke.

"How're you travelling, Charli?"

I turned to look at her. Her eyes were still tired, but her smile was as warm as a Victorian sunset.

"Okay, I guess," I said. "I didn't realise it was going to be like this, to be honest."

"What *did* you think?"

I shrugged. I hadn't actually even thought about it at all: missing Celeste crowded out everything else. 

"You miss her, don't you?" Sarah said. I couldn't look at her: my throat suddenly gripped by a painful spasm. As i brought my hand up to wipe my cheeks, I smelled... *her*. On my wrists. And thought of the man on the platform behind me.

I looked up: Sarah's eyes were still on me.

"I'm afraid you've sort-of fallen into the deep end of the pool, hun," she said, "and we need to get you knowing how to swim really quick." She paused, pursing her lips as she studied me. "It's not like you do stupid things, just... not real safe."

My heart sank, and my face along with it. Sarah touched my hand.

"I'm sorry, that was unfair of me. You weren't to know. I get it: this is all new to you. Being a woman in Wardrobe is a completely different thing to being a woman in the wilds of, well, anywhere else, really." She held her forehead for a second like she was worried her head would suddenly twist off. "I don't think any of us realised the challenge you would be facing."

I felt a dark cloud settle into my body.

"What do you mean?"

Sarah sighed. Opened her mouth to speak, then sighed again. She closed her eyes with a grimace, balling her hand into a fist.

"Right then, Charli." Her tone was not soft, but clear. No misunderstandings. "Here's the deal. You see, you don't *see* certain things that, well, you need to be aware of."

I blushed, remembering her face when I'd J'Adored my wrists.

"Oh, I'm such an idiot, I'm so..." She stopped me.

"No, hun, it's so much more than that. I mean, I get you were... wrecked about leaving Celeste behind, but..." She paused, struggling for words.

"What?"

"It's simple. Actually, so simple I'm surprised we didn't think of it before we left. Charli, you are *new*: painful, obviously, cluelessly new at being a girl."

Nothing what she'd just said made any sense to me. 

*Yes, I was new at it. So what?*

There was just a tinge of exasperation in her look, now. She nodded quickly, as if she'd found the missing link to my understanding of the issue.

"Look, girls grow up learning all about how to detect danger. Grope-y guys, creeps that rub up against you in trains, that sort of thing. And you're wandering along like you're on a garden path surrounded by daisies. It's not like there's danger everywhere, but if there was, you have a bullseye on your back."

*Danger? What had I missed?*

*Emotional temperature*:  
I felt a numbness instead of excitement. How nice it would be to share this moment with her: I'd be excited right now. Big sigh. Oh well, let's look at the pretty clouds as we fly through them.

At the ticket kiosk in Eagle Junction, I dug through my purse for the credit card and felt something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider. J'Adore. My heart did a flip. I felt Celeste *there*, with me, as I held the little white vial. I wanted to hide myself in that little vial, just to feel her warmth again. Held it to my face, eyes closed, then quickly sprayed my wrists, tiny little mists. I heard Sarah's gasp before I saw her eyes of dismay.

"What?" I didn't ask but I could tell I'd almost certainly stuffed up somewhere along the line. "What did I do wrong now?"

"That certainly smells nice, love," I heard a voice boom behind me. I cringed, and glanced at Sarah. Her face read: "now do you get it?" I squeezed my eyes shut, frozen in place.

Just then, the train roared past, coming to a screeching halt. Sarah gently propelled us to a reasonable empty carriage.
