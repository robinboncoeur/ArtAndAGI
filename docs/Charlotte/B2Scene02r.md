[ *Celeste* ]
**Beat 1 — Entry**

Celeste misses Charli, Charli is a bit down from day's experiences.

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

They talk on video-link.
Sarah and Charli share day's challenges. Sarah tries to reassure.

**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

Celeste realises Charli is less equiped as woman in public space than she thought, worries. Celeste understands Sarah's primary objective is setting up Wardrobe 2.0.

**Beat 4 — Choice**

Charli wears a brave smile, tries to convince Celeste she'll be fine. Celeste smiles warm, tender (yet feels dread) (internally) wondering whether to have Charli return home.

**Beat 5 — Power Adjustment (TURN)**

Sarah speaks briskly, confidently. Celeste cedes to Sarah's judgment, for now. Sarah and Celeste (privately) discuss transphobia, need for mentoring. Sarah has an idea: age-contemporary mentoring. Sarah would vet for transphobic inclinations.

**Beat 6 — Exit Note**

The tightness in Celeste chest is still there.

[ *Celeste* ]
**Beat 1 — Entry**

Unlocking the front door to our little flat made a "You're in the wrong home" click. The silence was as bad as an accusation.

Celeste's breath comes quicker as Charli's face appears on screen. 

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

Then, her stomach sinks: his smile is telling untruths, his body betrays the smile. His happiness over the perfume has a wobbly edge he seems intent on hiding.

**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

(Later, when Sarah and Charli share day's challenges. Celeste realises Charli is less equipped as woman in public spaces than she thought.) Celeste speaks slowly, cautiously. "Did we screw up? Are we pushing her too fast?"

Sarah: "Look, I figured there would be little gaffs like this. How is she to know? She'll pick it up-she's quick." Sarah wore the same smile she did when Mara put her on sorting pins: "What, me worry?"
Celeste feels herself tighten anyway. Asks: "Is this too much for her?" An ache in the jaw reminds her that we do not train by ambush. 

**Beat 4 — Choice**

Earlier, Charli's smile had appeared a fraction of a second late, as if prompted. Celeste wonders if it's homesickness or... when she asks Charli what she thought of the trip, Charli looks down, biting her lip. Celeste's smile freezes as her eyebrows slowly rise. Charli hides behind: "I did a few stupid things and... I just miss you..." and a tear runs down her cheek. 

**Beat 5 — Power Adjustment (TURN)**

Chatting to Sarah, they both speak briskly at first, confidently. Business at hand: initial site visit shared. The ache Celeste felt eases. Sarah touches on Charli's little challenges with an off-handed grin and a wink. "She'll be fine, Celeste. Just for a month." Celeste's look is sharp, so Sarah adds: "Got an idea. Charli needs someone her own age to bring her up to speed." Celeste feels a loosening in her shoulders the more she talks to Sarah, agrees with Sarah's ideas. Sarah and Celeste (privately) discuss transphobia, need for mentoring. Sarah has an idea: age-contemporary mentoring. Sarah would vet for transphobic inclinations.

**Beat 6 — Exit Note**

The tightness in Celeste chest is still there, but for a different reason. "I won't have my beautiful woman to cuddle tonight." She allows herself to cry, softly.
Scene ends.

## Sensory Ends

**Facial**
He surprised his face with a wide smile.
Her smile melted slowly.
Her smile froze as her look sharpened.
She held her slowly fracturing smile a little longer.
Her mouth was asking her eyes fo permission to smile.
Her mouth fell slowly open, as if unattended.

**Body**
His head snapped back as he frowned.
She pulled her chin into the air, her eyes narrowing.
His eyelids slid shut under their own weight.
An involuntary chuckle almost made it out into the open.
She bit a thoughtful fingernail.
