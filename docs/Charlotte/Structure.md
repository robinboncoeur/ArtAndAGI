# On Writing

## Core Principles

Oh, this is where it gets deliciously disciplined. 😄

You’ve done instinct.
You’ve done immersion.
Now we build scaffolding.

Not formula.
Structure.

Because structure is freedom.

---

### 🧱 Scene Structure Framework 101

*(Built specifically for your style and this story’s DNA)* This is not Hollywood three-act nonsense. This is micro-architecture for emotionally layered scenes.

---

### 1️⃣ The 6-Beat Scene Spine

Every scene — even quiet ones — should answer these six questions.

---

#### Beat 1 — **Entry Position**

Where is everyone emotionally *before* the scene begins?  
Not plot. Not action.

**Emotional temperature.**

Example:

* Charli is steady but socially tired.
* Celeste is focused but slightly preoccupied.
* Sarah is sharp and watchful.

Write this for yourself in one sentence before drafting.

If you don’t know entry temperature, you will wander.

---

#### Beat 2 — **Inciting Shift**

Something small but directional changes.

Not explosion.
Not drama.

A look.
A question.
An invitation.
A comment.
An absence.

Example:
“Pool party on Saturday.”

That’s it.

But now tension exists.

---

#### Beat 3 — **Internal Calibration**

This is your signature strength.

The character interprets the shift.

Not philosophising.
Not essay-writing.

Just:

* What does this mean?
* What do I feel?
* What is at stake?

Keep it embodied.
Keep it sensory.
Keep it inside the body.

---

#### Beat 4 — **Choice or Behaviour**

Someone acts.

Not necessarily boldly.

But something is chosen:

* Deflect.
* Accept.
* Change subject.
* Go quiet.
* Ask a question.

No scene without a choice.

---

#### Beat 5 — **Power Adjustment**

After the behaviour, who holds more control now?

Even subtly.

Power doesn’t mean domination.
It means:
Who is steering?

If power does not shift, the scene is static.

---

#### Beat 6 — **Exit Note**

End on:

* A line with weight.
* A withheld answer.
* A small physical gesture.
* A decision forming.

Never exit on summary.

Exit on tension.

---

### 🔄 The One-Sentence Rule

After drafting, you should be able to summarise the scene as:

“In this scene, ___ shifts because ___.”

If you can’t?
The scene lacks spine.

---

### 🪡 For Your Specific Story

We add 3 recurring diagnostic layers.

---

#### A. Visibility Meter

In this scene:
Is Charli:

* Hidden?
* Seen?
* Misread?
* Learning?

Track it.

It’s her long arc.

---

#### B. Celeste’s Control Index

In this scene:
Is Celeste:

* Designing?
* Restraining?
* Reacting?
* Misjudging?
* Protecting?

If she is neutral for too long, she flattens.

---

#### C. Trust Expansion Check

Does this scene:

* Increase Charli’s reliance solely on Celeste?
* Or widen her trust network?

We want widening.

Consciously.

---

### 🧠 Avoiding the “Weeds”

Here’s where you get lost sometimes:

You start refining language before the structure is stable.

So here’s your new discipline:

1. Write ugly.
2. Confirm the six beats exist.
3. Confirm power shift.
4. Confirm arc relevance.
5. THEN polish.

Polishing before spine = swamp.

---

### 📐 Scene Size Control

For your writing style:

* Intimate scene: 800–1500 words.
* Structural shift scene: 1200–2000.
* Quiet connector: 600–900.

If it exceeds 2500?
You’re likely blending two scenes.

Split.

---

### 🧨 What Makes a Scene Earn Its Place?

It must:

* Advance character.
* Or shift power.
* Or introduce new tension.
* Or resolve a prior tension.

If it only repeats emotional state?
Cut or compress.

---

### 🪞 A Quick Example — Pool Invitation Scene

Entry: Charli steady, Brittany relaxed.
Inciting shift: “Beach Saturday?”
Internal calibration: stomach tight, calculation begins.
Choice: “I might be busy.”
Power shift: Brittany senses something withheld.
Exit: “You don’t like swimming, do you?”

Scene complete.

Next scene deals with fallout.

---

### 🧭 Advanced Layer (When You’re Ready)

You can also map scenes in waves:

* External challenge.
* Internal interpretation.
* Relational reaction.
* Skill acquisition.
* New equilibrium.

But 101 is enough for now.

---

### Final Important Note

Structure is not there to constrain you.

It is there so that when you write softly,
the softness has weight.

You already have emotional intelligence.
Now we give it scaffolding.

---

All right. Would you like to:

A) Practice by outlining your next planned scene using this framework?
B) Take an existing scene and dissect it structurally?
C) Or build a master arc map for Book 2 before drafting further? 😄

Note: save from .yt-short iframe:  aspect-ratio: 9 / 16;

<style>
  .flex-container {display: flex; gap: 20px; align-items: flex-start;}
  .column {flex: 1 1 0; min-width: 0;}

  This video sets the stage for Charlie's venture into a realm he never had any interest in, but due to his infatuation (dare we call it **Love**) for Celeste, he was destined to travel. In the process, he learns much about history, the insidious and deleterious effect of the patriarchy on the lives of women through the ages.

  In order for this lesson to be learnt, 'Sharl' must first find himself in the unenviable role of discovering what it means to lose autonomy and have one's accomplishments be cancelled by society.

  A bit about Celeste: she's a trend-setting, headstrong, unique individual. Artistic, a leader not a follower, determined to get her way. Clever, schemer. Intensely likeable, incredibly feminine. Won't suffer fools or jocks.

These pages explore the 'cancelling' - as in: suppression - of a full one-half of humans through a cruel, unjust mindset called the 'patriarchy'. The story is based on that theme, with information I've sort-of picked up chatting with Emily (ChatGPT) and learning all about life in the 1750s (18th Century).

The film "Portrait de la Jeune Fille En Feu" lit the fuse that inspired the Celeste story. It also inspired this piece, 'Waterfall':

### Creating Dotpoints

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



### Links Management

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.




### Horizontal Separator Lines

The code is this (minus the '*')::

```
<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">
```

...which produces the following grey horizonal bar to help separate sctions (like the one below).
