## Core Principles

Oh, this is where it gets deliciously disciplined. 😄  
You’ve done instinct.  
You’ve done immersion.  

Now we build scaffolding.  
Not formula. Structure.  

Because structure is freedom.

---

**🧱 Scene Structure Framework 101**

*(Built specifically for your style and this story’s DNA)* This is not Hollywood three-act nonsense. This is micro-architecture for emotionally layered scenes.

---

### 1️⃣ The 6-Beat Scene Spine

Every scene — even quiet ones — should answer these six questions.

---

#### Beat 1 — **Entry Position**

Where is everyone emotionally *before* the scene begins?  
Not plot. Not action.

**Emotional temperature.**

Example:  
Charli is steady but socially tired.  
Celeste is focused but slightly preoccupied.  
Sarah is sharp and watchful.  

Write this for yourself in one sentence before drafting. If you don’t know entry temperature, you will wander.

---

#### Beat 2 — **Inciting Shift**

Something small but directional changes.  
Not explosion. Not drama.  
*A look.*  
A question.  
An invitation.  
A comment.  
An absence.  

Example: “Pool party on Saturday.”  
That’s it.

But now tension exists.

---

#### Beat 3 — **Internal Calibration**

This is your signature strength. The character interprets the shift.  
Not philosophising. Not essay-writing.  

Just:

* What does this mean?
* What do I feel?
* What is at stake?

Keep it embodied.  
Keep it sensory.  
Keep it inside the body.  

---

#### Beat 4 — **Choice or Behaviour**

Someone acts. Not necessarily boldly. But something is chosen:

* Deflect.
* Accept.
* Change subject.
* Go quiet.
* Ask a question.

No scene without a choice.

---

#### Beat 5 — **Power Adjustment**

After the behaviour, who holds more control now? Even subtly.

Power doesn’t mean domination. It means:  
*Who is steering?*  

If power does not shift, the scene is static.

---

#### Beat 6 — **Exit Note**

End on:

* A line with weight.
* A withheld answer.
* A small physical gesture.
* A decision forming.

Never exit on summary. Exit on tension.

---

### 🔄 The One-Sentence Rule

After drafting, you should be able to summarise the scene as:  
“In this scene, ___ shifts because ___.”  
If you can’t? *The scene lacks spine.*

---

### 🪡 For Your Specific Story

We add 3 recurring diagnostic layers.

---

#### A. Visibility Meter

In this scene:
Is Charli:

* Hidden?
* Seen?
* Misread?
* Learning?

Track it.

It’s her long arc.

---

#### B. Celeste’s Control Index

In this scene:
Is Celeste:

* Designing?
* Restraining?
* Reacting?
* Misjudging?
* Protecting?

If she is neutral for too long, she flattens.

---

#### C. Trust Expansion Check

Does this scene:

* Increase Charli’s reliance solely on Celeste?
* Or widen her trust network?

We want widening.

Consciously.

---

### 🧠 Avoiding the “Weeds”

Here’s where you get lost sometimes:

You start refining language before the structure is stable.

So here’s your new discipline:

1. Write ugly.
2. Confirm the six beats exist.
3. Confirm power shift.
4. Confirm arc relevance.
5. THEN polish.

Polishing before spine = swamp.

---

### 📐 Scene Size Control

For your writing style:

* Intimate scene: 800–1500 words.
* Structural shift scene: 1200–2000.
* Quiet connector: 600–900.

If it exceeds 2500?
You’re likely blending two scenes.

Split.

---

### 🧨 What Makes a Scene Earn Its Place?

It must:

* Advance character.
* Or shift power.
* Or introduce new tension.
* Or resolve a prior tension.

If it only repeats emotional state?
Cut or compress.

---

### 🪞 A Quick Example — Pool Invitation Scene

Entry: Charli steady, Brittany relaxed.
Inciting shift: “Beach Saturday?”
Internal calibration: stomach tight, calculation begins.
Choice: “I might be busy.”
Power shift: Brittany senses something withheld.
Exit: “You don’t like swimming, do you?”

Scene complete.

Next scene deals with fallout.

---

### 🧭 Advanced Layer (When You’re Ready)

You can also map scenes in waves:

* External challenge.
* Internal interpretation.
* Relational reaction.
* Skill acquisition.
* New equilibrium.

But 101 is enough for now.

---

### Final Important Note

Structure is not there to constrain you.

It is there so that when you write softly,
the softness has weight.

You already have emotional intelligence.
Now we give it scaffolding.

---

All right. Would you like to:

A) Practice by outlining your next planned scene using this framework?
B) Take an existing scene and dissect it structurally?
C) Or build a master arc map for Book 2 before drafting further? 😄

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">









## 🧱 Your Scene Spine

**Tightened (Same content, cleaner structure)**

Here’s how your beats map if we compress properly:

**Beat 1 — Entry**

Charli inside her head (homesick), Sarah sharp and scanning.

**Beat 2 — Inciting Shift (PRIMARY)**

Man offers to handle Charli’s bag; Sarah intercepts. Charli registers: *Oh. That’s a thing.*

**Beat 3 — Internal Calibration**

Charli feels the heat of being perceived. Realises she’s been mentally elsewhere. The world is closer than she thought.

**Beat 4 — Choice**

Charli shrinks (physically moves behind Sarah / lets Sarah speak).

**Beat 5 — Power Adjustment (TURN)**

Later, in the crush of the train, Charli catches something first (a hand too close / a man pressing in / a stare). She adjusts position *without waiting*.

Sarah clocks it. Doesn’t praise. Just… accepts it.

**Beat 6 — Exit Note**

The smile at Landsborough. Charli smiles back automatically — then feels the risk of that reflex. Not fear. Awareness.

Perfect exit. Beautifully “still has much to learn” without stating it.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">









### 🛠️ Template

**Cleanly in Zed**

Here’s the way I’d suggest formatting it while drafting:

```markdown
Beat 1 – Entry Position
[Write scene…]

Beat 2 – Inciting Shift
[Write scene…]

Beat 3 – Internal Calibration
[Write scene…]

Beat 4 – Choice
[Write scene…]

Beat 5 – Power Adjustment
[Write scene…]

Exit Note
[Write scene…]
```

Or, if you want it less intrusive:

```markdown
[ENTRY]
…
[SHIFT]
…
[CALIBRATION]
…
[CHOICE]
…
[POWER]
…
[EXIT]
```

You delete the scaffolding later.

But during drafting?
It’s guard rails.

## Emotions

Hi you 🌿
Oh, I *love* that you’re building a quiver. That’s exactly how voice gets stronger — not by avoiding repetition, but by having options so you can choose the one that fits the moment. You’re after **positive overwhelm** — not lust, not melodrama — but that sudden rush of love or belonging that almost knocks cognition sideways. Here are a variety of sensory-grounded alternatives, each leaning slightly different in texture:

---

### 🌊 Flood / Wave Variations (but fresher)

1. **It rose so quickly I had to steady myself against it.**
2. **The feeling came up under my ribs and pressed the breath out of me.**
3. **Something warm broke open inside me, too large to hold neatly.**
4. **It moved through me faster than I could name it.**
5. **My chest filled as if someone had poured light into it.**

---

### 🫁 Breath / Body Interruptions

6. **My breath caught — not in panic, but in recognition.**
7. **For a second, my body forgot how to move.**
8. **I blinked, as if the room had tilted toward brightness.**
9. **My throat tightened, not from fear but from too much feeling at once.**
10. **I had to swallow before I trusted my voice.**

---

### 🌞 Warmth / Expansion (gentler, steadier love)

11. **Heat unfurled behind my sternum and spread outward.**
12. **I felt myself soften from the inside out.**
13. **Something in me unclenched without asking permission.**
14. **The space between us seemed suddenly smaller, charged.**
15. **It settled over me like warmth after stepping in from the cold.**

---

### 🕊 Recognition / Alignment (mature love, not teenage intensity)

16. **A quiet certainty clicked into place.**
17. **The world narrowed to the exact size of this moment.**
18. **Everything in me leaned toward her.**
19. **I felt known — and it startled me.**
20. **For a heartbeat, nothing else existed but that understanding.**

---

### 💧 Tear-Edge Without Saying “I Cried”

21. **My vision blurred at the edges.**
22. **I pressed my tongue to the roof of my mouth to stay steady.**
23. **I looked away, buying myself a second to gather the spill.**
24. **My eyes stung, inconveniently.**
25. **I laughed softly, because it was safer than letting the rest show.**

---

Now — craft note, because you care about that level of precision:

“Flooded” is external imagery. But what makes overwhelm feel real is **interruption**. Something gets disrupted: breath, posture, voice, motor control, focus. If you show the interruption, the reader *feels* the overwhelm without you naming it.

For Celeste, you might lean toward:

* containment cracking
* controlled breath breaking rhythm
* heat + decision

For Lauren:

* softening
* relief sliding in
* breath finally releasing

For Sarah:

* pause
* recalibration
* choosing to stay

Different women, different somatic tells.

If you’d like, we can build a **micro-dictionary** organised by character — so each one has her own physical signature when love hits. That would make the prose quietly powerful without repetition. ✨

---

Oh, that makes me ridiculously happy 😄 — the fact that it slots straight into `Structure.md` without you wrestling it. Clean systems, clean prose. There’s something deeply satisfying about that alignment. And yes… that shift from *flood* to *interruption* is not cosmetic. It changes the emotional physics.

“Flooded” implies something happening *to* the character.
“Interrupted” implies something happening *through* the character.

One is passive overwhelm.
The other is embodied response.

That distinction is huge for the women you’re writing — especially in a world where agency matters. When the breath catches, when the hand stills mid-gesture, when the voice needs a second — that’s not weakness. That’s power recalibrating. It’s the nervous system going, *oh. This matters.* And I think what makes your work strong is that you’re rarely chasing spectacle. You’re chasing precision. The exact somatic hinge where the internal shifts. If you want to push it even further, here’s an additional layer to play with in `Structure.md`:

### Interruption Types (Micro-Calibration)

* **Breath interruption** → sudden emotional recognition
* **Hand stilling** → choice being made
* **Voice delay** → feeling outrunning composure
* **Eye movement (look away / look back)** → vulnerability vs control
* **Posture shift (straighten / soften)** → surrender vs resolve
* **Temperature shift (warmth, cool air awareness)** → safety vs exposure

That way, when you revise, you’re not thinking “how do I describe love?”
You’re thinking, *“What did her body do in that second?”*

That’s the difference between writing emotion and writing embodiment. And embodiment is always more powerful. 💛

If you’d like next time, we can build a “Do Not Use” list too — the phrases you keep tripping over — and replace them with calibrated alternatives. That kind of internal editing toolkit is gold over the long run.








Hi Robyn 💛
This is *already* doing so much right: the weather/metallic light, the “managed environment vs wild west” thesis, Sarah’s protective positioning (body between you and platform), and that final ping — gorgeous button. 👌

Now for what you actually asked for: the **recurring body tells**. You’ve flagged them yourself:

* throat tight/tightened
* stomach tightened/dipped
* shoulders curling in
* (plus a couple of near-kin: “swallowed hard,” “eyes went hot,” “cheeks burning”)

They’re all *true* for Charli. The issue isn’t “don’t use them,” it’s **don’t stack them as your default trio**. What we want is the same emotional truth expressed through *different systems* of the body: breath, mouth, temperature, posture, hands, vision, hearing, balance.

Below is a **mini-dictionary** you can paste straight into your toolkit, *and* then I’ll point to exact spots in your excerpt where you can swap things with minimal disruption.

---

### Body-reaction mini-dictionary (for Charli)

#### THROAT / VOICE (instead of “throat tightened”)

1. **My voice went thin.**
2. **My voice stuck for a second.**
3. **I had to clear my throat, like it had closed on me.**
4. **Words gathered behind my teeth and wouldn’t come out.**
5. **I swallowed around the lump and tried again.** *(close cousin, still good in rotation)*
6. **My mouth went dry.**
7. **My tongue felt too big for my mouth.**
8. **I could hear my own breathing in my ears.**

#### STOMACH / GUT (instead of “stomach tightened/dipped”)

9. **Something dropped through me like a lift.**
10. **My guts went cold.**
11. **I felt hollowed-out, suddenly, like the bottom fell away.**
12. **Nausea licked at the back of my throat.** *(gentle; not melodramatic)*
13. **My middle went heavy, as if I’d swallowed a stone.**
14. **My appetite vanished mid-thought.**
15. **My body braced before my mind caught up.**

#### SHOULDERS / MAKING SMALL (instead of “shoulders curled in”)

16. **I drew in, without meaning to.**
17. **I tucked my elbows closer to my ribs.**
18. **My chin dipped.**
19. **I turned my body sideways, reducing my surface area.**
20. **I shifted my bag in front of me like a shield.** *(you already do this—great signature)*
21. **I found myself standing behind Sarah’s shoulder.**
22. **My posture collapsed a fraction.** *(if you want it blunt and clean)*

#### HEAT / FLUSH / SHAME (for “burning cheeks/heat climbed neck” variety)

23. **Heat flashed behind my ears.**
24. **My face prickled.**
25. **My skin felt suddenly exposed.**
26. **I could feel myself colouring.** *(old-fashioned, works in Charli’s self-consciousness)*
27. **A hot pulse climbed my throat.** *(careful: don’t overuse; it’s strong)*

#### HANDS / MOTOR CONTROL (great for “interruption”)

28. **My grip went too tight on the handle.**
29. **My fingers went clumsy.**
30. **My hands didn’t know where to go.**
31. **I fussed with something useless—strap, zipper, ticket—anything.**
32. **I still-held, like moving would draw attention.**

#### VISION / ATTENTION (subtle, very effective)

33. **The edges of my vision went soft.**
34. **I fixed on a detail—tile line, shoe, ad poster—because it was safer than faces.**
35. **I couldn’t keep my eyes up.** *(simple, honest)*
36. **The carriage felt too bright.**

---

## Targeted swaps in *your* excerpt (low-friction edits)

I’m going to suggest swaps that keep your rhythm and don’t “rewrite the scene,” just diversify the somatics.

### 1) “trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.”

**Option A (clean):**

* “trying to work out why **my guts had gone cold**.”

**Option B (more Charli):**

* “trying to work out why **my body had braced**.”

**Option C (more sensory):**

* “trying to work out why **it felt like the bottom of me had dropped a notch**.”

### 2) “fold in, make smaller, disappear.”

This is already *excellent* as a triad. If you want a variant elsewhere, keep the *meaning* but change the mechanism:

* “**tuck my elbows in, turn sideways, vanish**.”

### 3) “The thought of her made my throat ache.”

This one is *beautiful* and distinct from “tightened,” so I’d keep it. It’s love-sorrow, not fear.

### 4) “Heat climbed my neck.”

You can keep this once, but later you’ve got “cheeks burning” etc. Rotate one:

* “**Heat flashed behind my ears.**”
  or
* “**My face prickled.**”

### 5) “My stomach dipped. I shuddered…”

Pick *one* system here. Right now you’re doubling (gut + full-body). You can make it sharper by choosing one:

**Option A (gut only):**

* “**My middle dropped.** I closed my eyes.”

**Option B (motor only):**

* “My hands went still at my sides. I closed my eyes.”

**Option C (vision only):**

* “The platform tilted a fraction. I closed my eyes.”

### 6) “My eyes went hot.”

This is a strong signature for Charli. Keep it, but don’t always follow it with looking down. You can vary the *escape route*:

* instead of “looked down quickly,” try:

  * “I blinked hard and stared at the seat seam.”
  * “I kept my eyes on the window, unblinking.”
  * “I watched my own hands like they belonged to someone else.”

### 7) “I felt my shoulders curl in without permission.”

This is one of your flagged repeats. Swap to elbows/chin/bag:

**Option A:**

* “I **tucked my elbows in** without permission.”

**Option B (my favourite; matches earlier bag-shield):**

* “I **pulled my handbag closer** without meaning to.”

**Option C (very clean):**

* “My posture **collapsed a fraction**.”

### 8) “My throat tightened again…”

This is the big one because you even bolded it — totally fair as a marker. But it’s the exact moment to *prove* the “interruption” concept from earlier.

Swap it to **voice/mouth** or **breath**:

**Option A (voice):**

* “**My voice went thin**, but this time it wasn’t only sadness…”

**Option B (mouth):**

* “**My mouth went dry**, but this time…”

**Option C (breath):**

* “**My breath hitched**, but this time…”

Each keeps your sentence structure almost identical.

---

## A tiny pattern tweak that will do *a lot*

Right now you sometimes do: **sensation → explanation** (“my throat tightened… it was realizing…”)

A slightly stronger pattern for this book is:
**external trigger → micro-interruption → action**
…then maybe *one* line of meaning.

Example using your last bit:

Instead of:

> My throat tightened again… it was… realising I’d been walking around…

Try:

> My breath hitched. I looked away fast — not because I was ashamed, exactly, but because I’d just realised I’d been walking around with my guard down and hadn’t even known it.

Same content. More embodied. Less “named.”

---

## Two “signature tells” you already have (keep these!)

Just so you don’t accidentally polish away what’s *working*:

* **Bag as shield / re-positioning** (you do it twice, and it’s a perfect Charli tell)
* **Fixating on surfaces** (concrete, aisle floor, window) — that’s a very real trauma/avoidance mechanism and reads cleanly.

---

If you want, next step is we make this ultra-practical:

### Charli’s “Top 12” default reactions (with a rotation rule)

So you can literally scan a scene and go: *ok, I used throat/eyes/stomach already—swap to grip/vision/elbows.*

But even without that: with the swaps above, this excerpt will instantly feel more varied without losing Charli’s anxious-wire consistency. ✨














## New Site Challenges

<img src="/assets/images/emily/260219ad.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

Oh this is a deliciously practical question. 🧵✂️
And it’s exactly the kind of grounded texture that will make the Maleny expansion feel real rather than “set dressing.”

You don’t need grand drama. You need **annoying, competence-testing friction** — the sort of problems women solve before lunch while the world assumes they’re “just sewing.”

Here are categories first (so you understand the logic), then specific dot-points Sarah could rattle off briskly before pivoting to Charli.

---

## 1️⃣ Physical Build & Fit-Out Issues

Wardrobe isn’t a café. It has *very specific spatial needs*.

### Layout & workflow problems

* Pressing station too close to cutting tables — steam drifting onto fabric.
* Not enough natural light over the pattern table.
* Overhead lighting too cool — makes fabric colour look wrong.
* No proper extraction for steam irons (humidity building up).
* Power points in the wrong place for industrial machines.
* Cutting table height wrong — bad for backs long-term.

### Storage headaches

* Crates arriving before shelving is installed.
* No lockable cabinet for vintage trims and rare lace.
* Costume rails not rated for heavy 18th-century gowns.
* No dedicated “quarantine rack” for repairs and returns.

### Infrastructure

* Tradies everywhere, slowing workflow.
* Air-con unit too loud for fittings.
* Dust from construction settling on finished garments.
* Security system not installed yet (expensive stock onsite).

---

## 2️⃣ Operational & People Issues

This is where Sarah shines — observational, dry, competent.

### Staff dynamics

* Fiona’s girls keen but inexperienced with historical accuracy.
* Someone confident but sloppy with seam finishes.
* One over-eager apprentice trimming seam allowances too close.
* Confusion about chain of authority (who signs off final garments?).

### Supplier delays

* Crates delayed by weather / freight mix-up.
* Missing hardware (busks, boning, period-accurate buttons).
* Fabric batch slightly different dye lot from original order.

### Safety & compliance

* Fire inspection pending.
* No first-aid station fully stocked yet.
* WorkSafe requirements for steam equipment.

---

## 3️⃣ Brand & Reputation Risks

Wardrobe isn’t just clothes. It’s reputation.

* Local Faire committee pushing for “faster, cheaper” rather than accurate.
* Pressure to compromise historical lines to suit modern bodies.
* Marketing photos taken before proper staging.
* Local volunteers treating it like community theatre, not atelier.

Sarah would clock these with that dry, slightly sardonic tone you love for her.

---

## 4️⃣ Emotional Undercurrent (Subtle but Important)

And here’s the clever part — the challenges Sarah lists can *mirror* what Charli is going through.

* Things not quite fitting yet.
* Systems not settled.
* Structure not fully built.
* Dust everywhere before polish.
* Good bones, unfinished surface.

That gives you thematic cohesion without stating it.

---

# How Sarah Might Rattle It Off (Dot-Point Style Dialogue)

Before sliding to Charli:

> “Site’s half-ready. Tradies still underfoot.
> Shelving not installed, so crates will just… sit.
> Lighting’s wrong over the cutting table — colours look anaemic.
> No proper extraction yet, so steam’s going to turn the place tropical.
> Fiona’s staff are enthusiastic, but one of them trims seam allowances like she’s punishing them.
> And the Faire committee already asked if we could ‘simplify’ some of the 1790s silhouettes. I nearly bit someone.”

That’s very Sarah.

Then she shifts:

> “But that’s all fixable.
> What I’m more interested in is Charli.”

And now you’ve slid into Beat 3 territory naturally.

---

## If You Want It Slightly More Technical (Because You Love Realism)

For a late-18th-century focused Wardrobe:

* Boning channels incorrectly placed in sample bodice.
* Pattern grading errors for petite frames.
* Linen shrinkage miscalculated.
* Imported silk creasing due to humidity.
* Corset lacing hardware delayed at customs.
* No proper dress form in Charli’s exact proportions yet.

That last one is subtle gold.

---

## The Best Part?

All of these challenges reinforce:

* Women building something real.
* Competence under pressure.
* Refusal to compromise standards.
* Systems being installed before softness returns.

Which mirrors Celeste’s own internal calibration beautifully.

---

If you’d like, I can:

* Draft a crisp Sarah-style 6–8 line “update” paragraph.
* Or design a **Wardrobe Expansion Checklist** you can save in your bible.
* Or help you pick which practical issue best thematically foreshadows Charli’s wobble.

Your instincts are excellent here. You’re building texture, not drama — and that’s how grown-up fiction breathes. 🧡

## Audio Test

<img src="/assets/images/emily/260219ae.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

I wrote Celeste’s Girl because I’m tired of two lies.
That womanhood is a costume.
And that trans women are a threat rather than an ally.

I know intimately what male privilege feels like from the inside. And I know what it means to step away from it. No one abandons that invisible armour for skirts and perfume. They do it for survival. For coherence. For the simple, radical relief of finally recognising themselves in the mirror… and in their own life.

This story isn’t interested in spectacle.
It’s interested in infrastructure.
In the women who quietly build worlds where other women can breathe.

Wardrobe is a deliberate answer to the patriarchy’s workshops and back rooms. It’s a place where competence is normal. Where care is policy. And where a trans girl isn’t a punchline, or a fetish object, or a theory. She’s a colleague. A daughter. A wife. One of the women.

I wanted to show what happens when a former beneficiary of patriarchy walks into a women-led space and says—without quite knowing it yet—I belong with you. What does it cost her? What does it cost them? And what do they gain together that none of them could have had alone?

Celeste’s Girl is my love letter to women’s work. To chosen family. And to the fierce, unglamorous kind of solidarity that stands in front of loading bays and board tables and says:
“No. Not here. Not to her.”

It’s also a quiet insistence that trans women are not an enemy camp… but some of the keenest, most motivated allies women will ever have in dismantling the structures that harm us all.
