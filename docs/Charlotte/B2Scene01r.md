## Visible

"*Ladies and Gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane...*"

Although my heart did a flip as the engine noise seemed to quieten, I felt a numbness instead of excitement. 

*How amazing it would be to share this moment with her*. 

The wing flapped vigorously as if trying to get down out of the grey clouds as we bumped and swayed in our seats. I shot Sarah a nervous grin. Her fingers gripped the handle firmly, her lips frozen in a brave thin line. It wasn't until the wheels hit the ground with a reassuring thump that that grip loosened.

The rain on the window obscured the view. The instant the wheels stopped moving some passengers started doing that silly thing where they think that getting out of their seats is going to ensure them getting off the plane faster. Sarah remained immobile, her lips no longer clamped together.

Sarah was looking at her phone.

"Fiona apologises... she won't be able to pick us up here. We'll have to take the train to... Landsborough."

Sarah got out of seat and reached up for her carry-on. I slid out of my seat and stood, my bum a bit achy from sitting so long. I gave it a quick rub and stretched up to retrieve my bag, but it had slid to the back of the overhead luggage thing.

"Can I give you a hand with that?"

A young man with a calico shirt and sunburnt neck was smiling at me, so I smiled back.

"Yes, please..." I started, when Sarah abruptly reached up and pulled down my bag. She shot the young man an expression that faintly resembled a smile.

"Thanks for the offer, mate," she said, placing herself between me and the young man.

Something about the whole thing seemed unusual, but I shrugged it off. Once we got in the concourse, we walked briskly, as if late for an appointment. We found ourselves at the baggage claim in no time. I was focused on our bags, but Sarah seemed a bit distracted. It wasn't until we were hurrying along to the train terminal that she spoke.

"Did you notice..." she asked, interrupting herself at my questioning look.

"Notice what?"

"Never mind," she said quickly. We had only just bought the tickets and gotten on the train when it left. It was full: all seats taken. I stood in the middle of the exit area. People were crowding from all sides. I felt Sarah's hand firmly pull me to the side of the carriage. Her eyes looked tired. The train stopped, and the doors opened, letting more people and hot sticky air in. The air-conditioning did its best to tone down the sour smell of travel-weary bodies but was losing the battle.   

At Eagle Junction, we stepped out of the train onto the hot concrete of the station platform.

"Which way is Landsborough?" I asked the man in a ticket office.

"You need to be on that platform there," he said with a thick accent. "Train leaves in about half an hour." 

"Thank you."

I dug through my purse for the credit card and felt something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider. Next to my credit card was a little white vial.

J’Adore.

My heart did a flip. For a second it was like Celeste was there with me, close enough to lean into. I passed the station master my card wordlessly, staring at the vial as if Celeste's eyes were going to magically appear.

"Miss?" I looked up: a hand with my card accompanied by a rather impatient face. I bit my lip and pocketing my card, retreated to a shady spot to wait for the train, gripping the little white vial as if it was a lifeline.

I wanted her here. I held the little white vial to my face, eyes closed, breathing in plastic and memory, and then—without thinking—sprayed my wrists. Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

I heard Sarah’s intake of breath before I saw her.

“What?” I said, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me—too close, too casual.

Heat climbed into my neck. I dropped my hands to my sides as if I could hide the smell by hiding the skin. Sarah’s look was a bit cold, but it wasn't anger as she positioned herself between me and the platform. I bit my lip and looked at the concrete.

The train screamed into the station. Sarah touched my elbow—firm, guiding—and steered us toward a carriage with space, putting her body between mine and the other people on the platform like it was the most ordinary thing in the world.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">








## Next Bit

The carriage was quite noisy for a while. I stared out the window, only occasionally glancing at Sarah, who quickly looked away. Eventually, a lot of passengers left the train and it became almost pleasant, except for that sour smell left behind by someone being very frugal with water usage: clearly not his week for a bath.

The business district look began to turn into gum trees and infrequent houses when Sarah spoke.

"How're you travelling, Charli?"

I turned to look at her. Her eyes were still tired, but her smile was as warm as a Victorian sunset.

"Okay, I guess," I said. "I didn't realise it was going to be like this, to be honest."

"What *did* you think?"

I shrugged. I hadn't actually even thought about it at all: missing Celeste crowded out everything else. 

"You miss her, don't you?" Sarah said. I couldn't look at her: my throat suddenly gripped by a painful spasm. As i brought my hand up to wipe my cheeks, I smelled... *her*. On my wrists. And thought of the man on the platform behind me.

I looked up: Sarah's eyes were still on me.

"I'm afraid you've sort-of fallen into the deep end of the pool, hun," she said, "and we need to get you knowing how to swim really quick." She paused, pursing her lips as she studied me. "It's not like you do stupid things, just... not real safe."

My heart sank, and my face along with it. Sarah touched my hand.

"I'm sorry, that was unfair of me. You weren't to know. I get it: this is all new to you. Being a woman in Wardrobe is a completely different thing to being a woman in the wilds of, well, anywhere else, really." She held her forehead for a second like she was worried her head would suddenly twist off. "I don't think any of us realised the challenge you would be facing."

I felt a dark cloud settle into my body.

"What do you mean?"

Sarah sighed. Opened her mouth to speak, then sighed again. She closed her eyes with a grimace, balling her hand into a fist.

"Right then, Charli." Her tone was not soft, but clear. No misunderstandings. "Here's the deal. You see, you don't *see* certain things that, well, you need to be aware of."

I blushed, remembering her face when I'd J'Adored my wrists.

"Oh, I'm such an idiot, I'm so..." She stopped me.

"No, hun, it's so much more than that. I mean, I get you were... wrecked about leaving Celeste behind, but..." She paused, struggling for words.

"What?"

"It's simple. Actually, so simple I'm surprised we didn't think of it before we left. Charli, you are *new*: painful, obviously, cluelessly new at being a girl."

Nothing what she'd just said made any sense to me. 

*Yes, I was new at it. So what?*

There was just a tinge of exasperation in her look, now. She nodded quickly, as if she'd found the missing link to my understanding of the issue.

"Look, girls grow up learning all about how to detect danger. Grope-y guys, creeps that rub up against you in trains, that sort of thing. And you're wandering along like you're on a garden path surrounded by daisies. It's not like there's danger everywhere, but if there was, you have a bullseye on your back."

*Danger? What had I missed?*

## Review

*Emotional temperature*:  
I felt a numbness instead of excitement. How nice it would be to share this moment with her: I'd be excited right now. Big sigh. Oh well, let's look at the pretty clouds as we fly through them.

---

At the ticket kiosk in Eagle Junction, I dug through my purse for the credit card and felt something cold, small, precious. I opened my bag wider. J'Adore. My heart did a flip. I felt Celeste *there*, with me, as I held the little white vial. I wanted to hide myself in that little vial, just to feel her warmth again. Held it to my face, eyes closed, then quickly sprayed my wrists, tiny little mists. I heard Sarah's gasp before I saw her eyes of dismay.

"What?" I didn't ask but I could tell I'd almost certainly stuffed up somewhere along the line. "What did I do wrong now?"

"That certainly smells nice, love," I heard a voice boom behind me. I cringed, and glanced at Sarah. Her face read: "now do you get it?" I squeezed my eyes shut, frozen in place.

Just then, the train roared past, coming to a screeching halt. Sarah gently propelled us to a reasonable empty carriage.

[26-02-24]

**“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”**

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if the captain was pumping the brakes. My heart did a flip — and then… nothing. Emptiness. A numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wings flapped bravely and the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped through grey cloud and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow steadiness from someone else.

Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money and an apology, her mouth, a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway — that solid, honest *thump* — I felt her grip loosen. Not much. Just enough to tell me she was human.

Rain smeared the windows into watercolour. The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. Never-mind: we’ll take the train.”

My legs were stiff when I stood — my bum numb from the seat — and I rubbed at the ache without thinking, then caught myself, suddenly aware of my own body in a public aisle.

Sarah lifted her carry-on down in one smooth motion. I reached for mine and my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

“Need a hand?”

A young man leaned in, all sunburnt neck and an eager smile. I smiled back automatically — because, why not, my mouth already opening.

“Yes, ple—”

Sarah’s arm went up. My bag came down. Quick, tidy, handle in my hand.

“Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said, and it was polite enough to pass as friendliness. But she placed herself half a step between us like it was choreography she’d learned years ago.

The young man’s smile faltered. I looked at the aisle floor with my luggage handle suddenly feeling awkward in my hand, trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.

We moved through the concourse at Sarah’s pace: brisk. Sarah's eyes were straight in front of her, purposeful, not looking at anyone. Signs. Doors. Escalators. She didn’t hold my hand or hover. She just… stayed close, as if intent on filling any space other people might try to step into.

At the first train, it was packed. Heat and damp wool and the sour tang of travel sweat and over-worked deodorant. Bodies pressed in, shoulders brushing, someone’s backpack zip scraping my arm. I planted my feet in the doorway area, bag hanging off one shoulder, and felt the old instinct tug at me — fold in, make smaller, disappear.

Sarah’s hand landed at my elbow. Firm. A correction, a direction: not a comfort. She shifted to the side, away from the open aisle, and I copied her — turned my body so my bag was in front of me, not behind. It was a tiny thing. But it made me feel less… accessible.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, her lips tightened quickly in acknowledgement.

At Eagle Junction, the platform heat hit like opening an oven. Concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Other platform,” the man said. “Half an hour.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for my card and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. There it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

*J’Adore*.

My heart did the flip again, but this time it *landed* somewhere. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to lean into — like the scent could form a bridge back to Torquay.

I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. Plastic and memory. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then — without thinking — I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me — too close, too casual, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. Cringing slightly, I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could swallow me.

Sarah's lips tightened again. Her face went cool in the way a door goes shut. She stepped in front of me as welcome as shade at noon. Practised. Almost... resigned.

The train screamed into the station.

Sarah touched my elbow — firm, guiding — and steered us toward a carriage towards the front of the train, her body between mine and the platform. We darted in, pulling our luggage like reluctant sheep behind us. 

---

The carriage was full and loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Just out of the pub chatter. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. I stared out the window and tried to do my best 'commuter heading home' face.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if she didn't want to provide an explanation.

Eventually the noise softened. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. What was left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said with a tiny shrug, and then, because I was sure she could see it sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged again, still small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing — crowded, constant — like there wasn’t room left for anything else.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly and brought my hand up to rub the back of my neck: it felt like cast in iron.

And then, the smell hit me — *J’Adore*, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there — and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

*Love*.

My stomach dipped. I shuddered, closed my eyes.

When I opened them, Sarah was watching me. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “Perhaps we should talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. Swallowed. Hard. “About… perfume?”

“About you, hun,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed — I could tell she noticed — because her hand came down gently on my forearm, not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said. “Don't… fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “This is no time to make yourself smaller.”

I grimaced, my cheeks burning. I hated it. She could always see it happening. Sarah sighed once, a small sound. “Listen. You kind-of got thrown in at the deep end." She puffed, rubbed her eyebrows. "Wardrobe is… a managed environment. Women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here, you don’t get that. It's the wild west.”

I stared at her, didn’t speak. The train rattled, we swayed in our seats. She nodded toward my wrist.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “It shouts. So do smiles: they scream. It's about the best way to be visible even if you don’t mean to.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out. Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree.

“Hun, you weren't to know. You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

Untrained.

The word landed oddly as bad as a tightly stitched seam. It felt cruel even as it came from a kind heart. I looked down at my hands. Then — slowly — I pulled my handbag into me. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too.

She didn’t comment.

That *was* her comment.

I stared out at the gum trees flashing past and tried to make my brain do two things at once: miss Celeste, and still be here.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “Here's what you *don't* do.”

I waited.

“Don't smile at strangers,” she said. “Want to be friendly? Choose who to be friendly to. Not just anyone.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t only sadness. It was something else — the sharp, uncomfortable feeling of realising I’d been walking around with my guard down because I didn’t know I was meant to have one.

---

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not out the window: at the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

Sarah had only touched the surface. I could tell by the purse in her lips, the set of her jaw. She didn’t want to drown me in it all at once. I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again.

For a second it twisted — platform, voice behind me — and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean *her*.

[26-02-24]

*“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”*

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if the captain was pumping the brakes. I felt a hard thud in my chest — and then… nothing. Emptiness. A numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here.*

The wings flexed as if the plane was flapping its wings faster to get us through the clouds. Raindrops streaked along the window as the cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat. We dipped under grey clouds and the light went flat and metallic. I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow steadiness from someone else.

Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money and an apology, her mouth, a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway — that solid, honest *thump* —  and the engines roared at the rain, I felt her grip loosen. Not much, just enough to allow breathing to resume.

Rain smeared the windows into watercolour. The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. Never-mind: we’ll take the train.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, her lips tightened quickly in acknowledgement.

By the time we reach Eagle Junction, the sun had come out. The platform heat hit like opening an oven. Drying concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Last platform,” the man said, indicating. “Ten minutes.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for a breath mint and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. There it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

*J’Adore*.

Everything in me leaned towards home, towards a little flat in Torquay, towards *her*. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to melt into. I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then — without thinking — I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said softly, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me — too close, too casual, too familiar, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. Cringing slightly, I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could form a wall around me.

Then, I glanced at Sarah. Her lips had tightened again, her face cool in the way a door goes shut. She stepped in front of me as welcome as shade at noon. Practised. Almost... resigned.

The train screamed into the station.

[ *Charli* ]

“Ladies and gentlemen, this is the captain speaking. We have begun our descent into Brisbane…”

The engine note thinned, the plane easing down as if the captain was pumping the brakes. I felt a hard thud in my chest—and then… nothing. Emptiness. A numb, floating blankness that made my hands feel slightly distant.

*She should be here*.

The wings flexed, shouldering us through the cloud. We dipped under the clouds and raindrops streaked along the window. The cabin rattled softly, like the whole fuselage was clearing its throat, and the light went flat and metallic.

I shot Sarah a nervous grin, the kind you give when you want to borrow steadiness from someone else. Sarah didn’t grin back. Her fingers were wrapped around the armrest like it owed her money and an apology… her mouth, a thin line.

When the wheels hit the runway—that solid, honest thump—and the engines roared at the rain, I felt her grip loosen. Not much, just enough to allow breathing to resume.

Rain had smeared the windows into watercolour.

The moment we stopped rolling, half the plane stood up like standing would summon the exit faster. Sarah stayed seated. She exhaled through her nose, eyes on her phone, unbothered by other people’s impatience.

“Change of plan,” she said. “No pickup. Never-mind: we’ll take the train.”

My body felt a little stiff when I stood, my bum numb from the seat, and I rubbed at the ache without thinking, then caught myself, suddenly aware of the public aisle.

Sarah lifted her carry-on down in one smooth motion. I reached for mine but my bag had slid back, wedged just out of reach.

“Need a hand?”

A young man leaned in, all sunburnt neck and eager smile. I smiled back automatically—because, why not—my mouth already opening.

“Yes, ple—”

Sarah’s arm went up. My bag came down. Quick, tidy, handle in my hand.

“Thanks for the offer, mate,” she said. It was polite enough to pass as friendliness.

The young man’s smile faltered. I looked at the aisle floor with my luggage handle suddenly feeling awkward in my hand, trying to work out why my stomach had tightened.

We moved through the concourse at Sarah’s pace: brisk. Sarah's eyes were straight in front of her, purposeful, not looking at anyone. Signs. Doors. Escalators. She didn’t hold my hand or hover, but just… stayed close, as if intent on filling space between us others might try to step into.

The first train was packed and steamy. The rain had stopped, but the damp air combined with heat and damp wool, leaving a sour aftertaste of travel sweat and over-worked deodorant. Bodies pressed in, shoulders brushing, someone’s backpack zip scraped my arm. I planted my feet in the exit area gripping luggage handles, handbag hanging off one shoulder, and felt the old instinct tug at me—fold in, make smaller, disappear.

Sarah’s hand landed at my elbow. Firm. A correction, direction. She shifted to the side, away from the open aisle, and I copied her, turned my body so my bag was in front of me. It was a tiny thing, but it made me feel less… accessible.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, her lips tightened quickly in acknowledgement.

By the time we reached Eagle Junction, the sun had come out. The platform heat hit like opening an oven—drying concrete radiated it back up through my shoes. I found the ticket office and asked which way, voice too soft in my own ears.

“Last platform,” the man said, indicating. “Ten minutes.”

“Thank you.”

I dug through my purse for a breath mint and my fingers found something cold, small, precious. There it was: a tiny white vial tucked beside my wallet like a secret.

*J’Adore*.

Everything in me leaned towards home, towards a little flat in Torquay, towards *her*. For a second it was like Celeste was close enough to melt into. I held the vial to my face, eyes closed. The thought of her made my throat ache.

Then—without thinking—I sprayed my wrists.

Two tiny mists. Soft. Private.

Sarah’s breath caught.

“What?” I said softly, already bracing. “Is that… bad?”

“That certainly smells nice, love,” a man said behind me—too close, too casual, too familiar, as if the word belonged to him.

Heat climbed my neck. Cringing slightly, I dropped my hands to my sides as if hiding skin could hide scent. My eyes went to the concrete like it could form a wall around me.

When I glanced at Sarah her lips had tightened again, her face cool in the way a door goes shut. She stepped in front of me as welcome as shade at noon. Practised. Almost... resigned.

The train screamed into the station.

Sarah touched my elbow—firm, guiding—and steered us toward a carriage towards the front of the train, her body between mine and the platform. We darted in, pulling our luggage like reluctant sheep behind us. 

--- 

The carriage was full and loud for a long while — not music loud, just bodies loud. Conversation still wearing its outside voice. Phone calls on speaker. A child kicking the seat somewhere behind me in a steady, cheerful rhythm. 

I stared out the window and arranged my face into commuter neutral.

Every now and then I glanced at Sarah. She glanced away almost immediately, as if she didn't want to provide an explanation.

Eventually the noise softened. The air didn’t get clean so much as… less lived-in. Left behind was a sour, stale smell that had nothing to do with rain and everything to do with someone making a decision about soap and sticking with it.

The city started to loosen into gum trees and scattered houses. The light went softer.

Sarah shifted in her seat.

“How’re you travelling, Charli?”

I swallowed. My throat still felt tight in a way that wasn’t from the plane. “Okay,” I said with a tiny shrug, and then, because I was sure she could see it sitting right there in my chest, “I didn’t think it was going to be like this.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. “What *did* you think?”

I shrugged again, still small. Missing Celeste had been a full-body thing—crowded, constant—like there wasn’t room left for anything else. And now, the real world kept crowding in.

“You miss her,” Sarah said.

It wasn’t a question.

My eyes went hot. I looked down quickly and brought my hand up to rub the back of my neck; it felt like cast iron.

And suddenly, the fragrance—J’Adore, still sitting on my wrists, faint but there—and with it the platform, the man’s voice behind me, that word like he owned it.

*Love*.

I shuddered, feeling slightly sick, and closed my eyes. When I opened them, Sarah was watching me. When she spoke again her voice was lower, flatter.

“Right,” she said. “Perhaps we should talk about that.”

I made myself look at her. Swallowed. Hard. 

“About… perfume?”

“About you, hun,” she corrected, and it was so matter-of-fact it didn’t feel like an insult. “Out here.”

I felt my shoulders curl in without permission. Sarah noticed—I could tell she noticed, because her hand came down gently on my forearm: not comforting, just anchoring.

“Don’t do that,” she said. “Don't… fold up.” She glanced at the aisle, then back to me. “This is no time to make yourself smaller.”

I glared at the seat back, my cheeks burning. She could always see it happening. Sarah sighed, a small sound. 

“You were thrown in a bit,” she said. She worried her thumbnail. “Wardrobe’s managed. There are women around you. Standards. Eyes on. Out here… it’s different.”

I stared at her, didn’t speak. The train rattled, we swayed in our seats. She nodded toward my wrist.

“Perfume carries,” she said. “It travels further than you think. Smiles do too. It’s an easy way to be noticed without meaning to.”

My mouth opened and nothing came out. Sarah’s expression softened by half a degree.

“You weren't to know. You’re not in trouble,” she added, as if she could hear the shame forming. “You’re just… untrained.”

*Untrained*.

The word sat wrong, like fabric cut against the grain. I looked down at my hands.

Then—slowly—I pulled my handbag into me. I didn’t know why it made me feel better. It just did.

Sarah saw that too.

She didn’t comment.

*That* was her comment.

“Okay,” I said finally, voice quiet. “So what do I do?”

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. “Here's what you *don't* do.”

I waited.

“Don't smile at strangers,” she said. “Want to be friendly? Choose who to be friendly to. Not just anyone.”

Something tightened in me again, but this time it wasn’t sadness—it was the uneasy understanding that I’d been walking through things without knowing I should brace.

The train hummed under my shoes, a steady vibration that made it impossible to forget I was moving.

I looked around properly this time. Not out the window: at the carriage. At who was left. Who was looking at their phones. Who wasn’t.

I rested my arm on the window ledge and caught the faint scent on my wrist again. For a second it twisted—platform, voice behind me—and I had to force myself to think harder, to bring Celeste’s face back into focus instead of that man’s.

I didn’t want the smell to mean carelessness.

I wanted it to mean *her*.

Just then, Sarah's phone pinged. She glanced down at it and grinned.

"Celeste."
