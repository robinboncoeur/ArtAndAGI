## Image and Erotica

[q]
Hi Emily. Today, I want to accomplish 2 things:

Recreate the exact dress in the image, in both Qwen-2512 and ZiT

Write "nice" erotica. Stuff with plausible deniability, but fairly intense because of powerful illustrative allusions that leave no question what's actually going on. Definitely nothing at all like Cleland - I hate porn, not for moral reasons but because it is so *BORING* - but perhaps leaving the door slightly more ajar than Georgette Heyer (my mum's favourite author, by the way).

Those are my objectives, today. Seem reasonable?

Robyn… this is *not* timid. It’s restrained — and that’s the right instrument for the kind of heat you’re aiming for. 🫶🔥
You’ve already got the core ingredients working beautifully:

* **Domestic specificity** (window seat, flat white cooling, laundry/pantry) = reality anchor
* **The “rules” frame** = moral architecture + plausible deniability
* **Desire as intrusion** (studies “frowning back,” the nettle metaphor) = obsession without pornography
* **The pivot word**: *yielding* = power dynamic, clean but unmistakable

If anything, the only thing “missing” is *pressure*: the sense that the room is closing in, that Celeste is *about to do something* rather than purely remember it. That’s an easy fix without changing your tone.

Below are **three options** you can choose from (or blend, as you like). I’ll keep your voice, your register, and your deniability. Each option ends with a natural “to be continued” hinge.

---

## Micro notes (surgical, not a rewrite)

If you want to polish the existing draft without changing shape:

* **“expresso” → “espresso”** (unless Charli says “expresso” as a character tell 😉)
* “unseeing out at” → “unseeing at” (or “past”)
* “malevolently” is fun, but “sullenly” / “balefully” reads a touch cleaner. Keep if you love it.
* “subtanceless” → “substance-less” or “insubstantial” (the latter is elegant)
* “clothes backet” → “basket”
* You have “enchanted” twice close together; the second one is perfect, so the first can become “hooked” or “caught.”

None of those are mandatory — just little seam allowances.

---

## Option A — Keep it reflective, add a *present-tense fuse* (minimal change)

This version keeps your structure, but adds a few lines that turn memory into imminent action.

✨ **Forsaken Studies** ✨
*(Celeste POV)*

I sat curled up in the window seat that doubled as storage, staring unseeing past autumn leaves, the wind worrying the branches as I sipped my morning flat white. Charli made the best flat whites. They’d splurged on a used espresso machine — built in Italy, ten years old, still absurdly pristine — and it produced coffee like a small miracle.

Charli was in the laundry (which also served as pantry) putting a load on. She wasn’t meant to be out and about, not during my study period, but almost all those rules felt… decorative now.

They’d been designed to protect me. Protect Charli too, of course, but when they were written, it was for a lad moving in with a young woman — a conventional sort of lad, the kind who required strict guidelines and consequences.

Not Mara, not Lauren, and not even I had understood what we were actually dealing with.

This person.

Charli.

I had another sip and stared balefully at my textbook. Statistics and Gantt charts frowned back, offended. I wasn’t in a headspace for any of it.

All I could think of was magic — the pure, simple, feral enchantment of a touch: Charli’s touch.

That first time I touched her hand… in the loos. I must have introduced myself. I can’t remember the words. What I remember is how light her hand felt in mine, almost insubstantial, long before I knew of *she.*

If I had known then, would I—

My breath caught, suddenly aware of the cliff edge I’d been strolling along with my hands in my pockets.

Charli emerged from the laundry carrying the clothes basket, cheeks pink from the steam. Her face brightened into a quick, bewitching smile that hit me like sunlight through a crack — and then she disappeared into the room that had been her bedroom, but was now ostensibly my study.

I’m pretty sure she’d seen through my ruse.

And when I told her… that melt, that doe-eyed delight she couldn’t quite bring herself to show.

My coffee was cooling too fast. I like savouring things — not greedy guzzling. Clothes. Restaurants. The slow pleasure of deciding on a more expensive eyeshadow and letting it become my mood for the day.

But when it came to Charli, my hunger had grown like a nettle patch in the part of the garden you avoid because you’ll come out stung and furious with yourself.

I didn’t recognise me.

Everything in the room seemed to pause when I remembered the first kiss.

Charli was humming to herself — some Russian melody she’d become enchanted by — and I was enchanted by her in a way that had stopped being cute.

The kiss had been sweet, yes. But it was her — so melting, so yielding, so *feminine* — and the thought made my vision narrow, my pulse start talking in my wrists.

It wasn’t only her touch I wanted.

It was her *agreement.*

A soft, quiet surrender that didn’t make her smaller — it made me feel… frighteningly large.

From the back room, the washing machine clicked into its cycle. A domestic sound. An ordinary sound.

And then, as if she’d felt my thoughts turn sharp, Charli’s humming stopped.

A second later, I heard her footsteps — not leaving, not hiding — but coming back toward me.

---

## Option B — Turn the nettle metaphor into a controlled, erotic “logic” (more intense, still clean)

This one makes Celeste’s desire feel inevitable, almost scientific, while remaining respectable.

…when it came to Charli, my hunger for her had grown like nettles in the part of the garden you avoid, because you tell yourself it’s simpler that way.

But avoidance is a kind of attention.

It’s a decision you remake every day. It takes effort. It has a pulse.

I stared at the text, the diagrams, the neat little blocks of authority pretending they could order my brain. I tried to summon discipline. I tried to be the person I was meant to be: responsible, ambitious, controlled.

Instead, my body remembered Charli.

Her hand in mine: so light it felt like a question.

And then the answer — not spoken, not explained — the way she yielded. Not because she was weak. Because she trusted me to be careful.

That was the part that undid me.

Charli hummed in the laundry. A quiet Russian melody, something minor-key and haunted. Domestic. Innocent.

It made me feel like a thief.

Not because I wanted her.

Because I wanted her *to let me.*

I wanted permission, not from rules, not from Mara, not from Lauren — but from Charli herself. I wanted her to look at me with those soft eyes and decide, deliberately, that I was safe enough to want.

My coffee cooled. My textbook sat there pretending it mattered.

From the laundry, the basket thumped lightly against the doorframe, and then Charli appeared — cheeks warm, sleeves pushed up, hair slightly untidy from work. She smiled at me like she couldn’t help it.

And I realised, with a small flare of panic, that I didn’t have the strength to keep pretending.

Not today.

---

## Option C — Add a “boundary line” (rules) and make Celeste step over it (highest tension, still deniable)

This is very effective for “safe but unmistakable.”

The rules had been designed to protect me.

And I’d honoured them. Mostly. Even now, even with my mind slipping, I’d tried to keep the scaffolding intact — because scaffolding is what keeps a beautiful thing from collapsing before it’s finished.

But the trouble with rules is that they aren’t built for exceptions. They’re built for averages.

Charli wasn’t an average.

She came out of the laundry with the basket, smiled that quick, bright smile, and disappeared again — and it struck me, with a clarity that made my stomach dip, that she’d been waiting.

Not for my permission.

For my decision.

My coffee cooled. My textbook stared back. I stared harder. We both lost.

I set the mug down carefully, as if the sound of ceramic might break whatever fragile control I still possessed. Then I stood.

One step toward the study door.

I stopped there — hand on the frame — because this was the line. The line between *study period* and whatever we’d become.

From inside, Charli’s humming continued, soft and unguarded.

I inhaled once, slow.

And stepped over.

## Which direction do you want for the continuation? 😊

You don’t need to answer a question if you don’t feel like it — but here are the natural “next beats,” and you can pick one instinctively:

1. **“Fitting as pretext”** — Celeste asks to “check the neckline” or “fix the cuff” (craft gives deniability).
2. **“Rule acknowledged”** — Celeste explicitly says “not here / not now,” and Charli’s disappointment is *the trigger*.
3. **“Charli initiates obedience”** — very subtle: she pauses in the doorway, waits, looks down, says “Yes?” and the heat is in how she offers herself to instruction.

If you paste what you want to happen in **one plain sentence** (even “Celeste goes into the study and touches her”), I’ll write the continuation in your exact tone and keep it clean-but-hot. 🌙🖋️
