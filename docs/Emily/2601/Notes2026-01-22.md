## Scene 30
### Review

Hi Emily. I've done some tweaks to Scene 30: would you be happy to have a look? Here it is:

**Scene 30 — “The Brush” (Celeste POV) - 1st Run**

---

Wardrobe had learned, over the last three months, to run like a body instead of a panic, not because the work was easier—if anything it had become more precise, more demanding—but because the women inside it had stopped wasting effort on uncertainty. Tools had homes. Labels existed. The ledger sat where it belonged, open when it needed to be open, shut when it didn’t. Even Mara’s silences had started to feel less like weather and more like method.

And Charli?

Charli moved through the room as if she’d finally stopped waiting to be told she was in the way.

She arrived early, same as always, but the early-ness had changed. It used to feel like an apology: now, it felt like preference. She hung her bag on the hook without flinching. Washed her hands with the same thoroughness, but without the old tremor of performance. She laughed sometimes, quietly, and the laugh stayed in the air instead of disappearing the second it appeared.

She had become... easier to look at. Not because she was “prettier” or because she was trying harder.

Because she was less afraid.

Mara set the next test on the table without ceremony: a cap and kerchief combination we’d been refining for the Faire women: something that had to survive heat, sweat, pins, movement, and the indignity of being yanked off and shoved into a tote bag between scenes.

“Hair,” Mara said, glancing at Charli as if the word was a tool she was calling for. “Fix it.”

Charli touched her own hair reflexively, as if the problem had just been named aloud. She had tied it back, in her customary scruffy ponytail. Tt was not with the discipline the cap required. Loose strands would catch. Pins would slip. The whole thing would migrate.

Tahlia, measuring a sleeve nearby, made a small amused noise. Lucy didn’t look up from her work. Sarah, perched like a judgmental crow on a stool, watched with the bright interest she reserved for social developments.

Charli stepped toward the mirror with a comb, uncertain.

I moved without thinking.

“Sit.”

Charli looked at me as if I’d told her to walk into the ocean. Then she sat, carefully, obediently, still holding her breath a little, like she wasn’t sure she’d earned the chair. 

I reached for the brush. It was an ordinary thing, with a wooden handle and bristles clogged with hair. When I drew it through her hair the first time, Charli went very still.

Not tense or flinching. Attentive. The brush made that low, dry sound a brush makes on clean long hair. I worked from the ends up, practical. Untangle. Smooth. Part. No pulling. No fuss.

“Hold your head,” I said. “Don’t tip back.”

“Yes,” she murmured, and then, an old reflex: “Sorry.”

I stopped the brush for half a beat and shook my head.

“Don’t apologise,” I said, flat. “Just hold still.”

“Okay.”

The room didn’t pause around us.

I gathered her hair at the nape, measured the tension with my fingers, and began to twist it into a coil that would sit properly beneath the cap. Pins went in with the same economy we used for everything: enough to hold, not so many it became a hedgehog. Sarah’s voice floated over from her stool.

“Look at that,” she said, pleased. “Civilisation.”

Charli’s smiled: a real smile.

Lucy looked up from her work long enough to say, “If she moves her head like that, the cap will sit properly. If she doesn’t, it’ll look like a mushroom.”

“Thank you,” Charli said automatically.

Lucy’s expression remained what it always was. “It’s just geometry.”

I set the cap on Charli’s head and adjusted the angle. The kerchief followed, tied firmly enough to hold, not so tight it would dig. I checked the line at the forehead, the way the fabric framed her face. For a second, only a second, I saw it: how *right* she looked in the thing, right in the way someone looks when the room around them finally matches something inside their body.

“Turn your head left.”

She turned.

“Right.”

She turned.

“Good.”

Mara glanced over, saw the fit, and gave a single curt nod, her version of approval.

“Now move,” Mara said. “Sweat. Bend. Prove it.”

Charli rose and began the wear-test: bending to reach fabric on the lower shelves, turning quickly, lifting her arms, moving through the narrow spaces between tables. The cap held. The kerchief held. The pins did their job. Tahlia watched her with a faint grin. Bree appeared in the doorway mid-test, took one look, and beamed.

“Oh, she looks *proper Missy*!”

The room laughed, and I saw Charli go pink: a soft, bashful warmth.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “Right then. She’s coming tonight.”

“She’s coming,” Tahlia echoed.

The day moved on.

The cap survived sweat and motion. The kerchief didn’t slip. The ledger received its notes. Mara’s shears kept snicking. The room kept laughing. And Charli kept laughing with it. Not small.

Real.

---

That evening, at home, the quiet hit me the way it always did after Wardrobe: like walking out of a river and realising your ears had been full of water.

Charli was in the shower. I could hear the muted rush behind the bathroom door, the steady sound of water striking tile. I moved through the apartment, tidying without thinking. Habit. Reset the space. Put things back where they belonged.

Her bag was on the chair. Not rummaged through. Not spilled open. Just... placed there, as if it had been arranged to look casual.

I don’t know what made me look. It wasn’t suspicion, not at first. It was the same part of my brain that noticed seam strain and pin tension, the part that registered when something was *slightly too controlled*. I lifted the bag and felt the weight shift in a way that didn’t match fabric.

I opened it.

Inside, tucked under folded cloth and a small notebook, was a pharmacy bottle. White plastic. Printed label. My stomach dropped before my mind caught up.

Spironolactone.

The name sat on the label like a fact that refused to be softened by context. I had heard of it. Anti-androgen. Puberty-blocker. A medication for which you need a script.

It was almost empty, empty enough to make the decision behind it feel old, not impulsive.

She had told me nothing about this.

My first impulse was anger: hot and sharp and immediate.

Not at her. At the risk.

At the secrecy.

It was anger at the thought of her taking *anything* unsupervised, unmonitored, unrecorded: her body becoming a private experiment without safeguards, without adult oversight, without anyone checking what it was doing to her.

And then the realisation arrived, colder and steadier: this was not rebellion.

This was a solution.

A private solution. *Her* solution. A girl trying to keep her place in a room of women by any means available.

I closed the bag carefully, as if the bottle might explode.

Then I opened it again and took the bottle out. There was no point pretending I hadn’t seen it. There was no point leaving it there like a trap. The bottle was evidence: it represented danger.

I set it on the kitchen table and waited.

The shower stopped. A door opened. Footsteps. The soft sound of Charli’s towel rubbing her hair.

She came into the kitchen in a t-shirt and track pants, damp hair loose around her shoulders, face relaxed in a way I hadn’t seen months ago. She looked... good. Warmer. Lighter.

Then she saw the bottle.

All the light left her face. She stopped so abruptly it was like she’d hit a wall. Her eyes flicked to mine, then down to the bottle, then back up to my face. In that moment, she wasn’t Charli of the workroom: laughing, included, adopted. She was the old version of herself: braced, terrified, trying to calculate what it would cost to be caught wanting.

“Where did you get it?”

My voice was quiet. Controlled. Adult.

Charli’s throat moved. “I—”

“Answer me.”

She swallowed. “Online.”

“How long?”

Her eyes dropped. “A while.”

“How *long*?” I repeated, and I heard, underneath my own calm, the steel that Wardrobe had taught me: standards, not sentiment. She breathed in, shallow.

“A while,” she whispered and then, glancing at my face, added quickly. “Okay... almost four months.”

Four months. Long enough for it to become her routine. Long enough for it to affect her body. And, long enough for her to build her happiness on it. I sighed.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

Charli’s hands twisted in the edge of her towel. She didn’t look up. 

“I didn’t want...” she began, and her voice cracked. “I didn’t want it to go away.”

“Didn't want *what* to go away?” My voice had an edge: I could tell by her shivering. She shook her head, eyes bright.

“The... the girls. The room. You. I didn’t want...” She took in a shuddering breath. Then, the words came spilling out. "I was changing. It was horrible. The changes I didn't think would happen, were... happening. It made me sick. I was scared I was going to turn..." She didn't finish. She didn't have to. There it was.

Not vanity.

Fear.

Fear of being returned to the category that had always hurt, because biology was betraying her. I felt something in me tighten and then settle into place.

“This is not how we do it.” I look her, steady. Charli flinched, didn't look up. “This is not safe. This is not supervised. You don’t get to do things to your body like a private trial and hope it works out.”

Her lips trembled. “But it was *working*.”

Her voice—small, desperate—made my chest ache. Because, *of course* it was working. And what else was happening didn't seem to enter into her equation. Stopping—even reversing—the effects of biology had given her a sense of control. It had quieted whatever terror had been chewing at her. It had let her smile without fear.

But it had done it at a cost she didn’t understand or know how to measure. 

I reached out and put my hand over the bottle, not possessive or dramatic: simply covered it. Claiming responsibility.

“I’m taking this.”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No—” she whispered, panic and imploring chasing each other accross her face.

“Yes.”

The word came out clean. Final.

“Look, you’re not being punished, Charli,” I said as gently as I could, keeping my own fear from spilling into her panic. “But you *cannot* do this without medical oversight. Do you understand me?”

Her breath hitched. A long moment passed. Finally, she nodded, small.

“Yes,” she whispered.

I picked up my phone.

“Who are you calling?” she asked, her voice tight.

“Your mum.”

Her face went white.

“Mum—”

“Charli, *listen*! We are not doing this alone." The firmness in my voice surprised me. "We are not keeping secrets that can harm you. Your mum needs to know. We need to get you professional help.”

Charli seemed to shrink into herself. She sat silent for several minutes while I retrieved my phone. When I returned to the kitchen, she was looking like the old Charlie, the disappearing Charlie. It was still her, but the glow of happiness was gone. My heart ached at how her eyes shone with unspilled tears. 

“Please don’t hate me.”

That was worse than finding the bottle: this expression of fear of rejection. I stepped closer. I ached to comfort her with softness, wrap her in cotton wool. And, as a result, make her dependent on me. I realised the best course was to anchor her with fact.

“Charli, I don’t hate you,” I said. “I *am* angry you did something that was so unsafe. And I’m angry you thought you had to do it alone. But I do not hate you.”

A tear slid down her cheek: she wiped it away quickly.

I dialled.

When Lauren answered, I didn’t waste words.

“I found an anti-androgen in Charli's purse, Lauren,” I said. “Spironolactone. Charli got it online: she's been taking it for months.”

There was a pause on the line—silence with weight. Then finally, her voice, tight.

“Is she okay right now?”

“She’s here,” I said. “She’s safe. But... this can’t continue.”

Another pause. I could hear Lauren breathing, holding herself together the way mothers do when the world tries to fracture them.

“I’m coming over.”

“Please do,” I replied. “We need a plan. We need medical oversight, like, with bloodwork and everything. She needs to see specialists who... understand this. Whatever the pathway is going forward, we need to do it properly.”

Lauren’s voice trembled once, just once, then steadied.

“Yes,” she said quietly. “Yes. We do it properly.”

I ended the call and looked at Charli. She was standing in the kitchen, towel clutched like armour, face raw, eyes frightened, fixed on me.

“We are going to get you help with this,” I said with determination. “Not on online forums: this is a serious step.”

Charli nodded, the hopelessnes slowly fading from her shoulders. Her red eyes sought mine. I held her gaze.

“This will be a series of boring appointments. Questions. Paperwork. Waiting. But it will be safe.”

Her mouth trembled.

“Okay.”

The word came out in a whisper. And in that whisper I heard everything she hadn’t said:

*I’m tired of being afraid. I’m tired of pretending I don’t want this. I’m tired of losing whatever I touch.*

“We start tomorrow.”

Charli nodded again. Her nod signalled the return to the new Charli, the one that understood surrender to structure—structure she’d been craving, structure she’d tried to replace with a bottle and secrecy. In the ensuing quiet, the apartment felt like Wardrobe did when the lights went down: still, intentional, waiting.

And for the first time, I understood with a clarity that made me almost cold: whatever Charli had done to keep her happiness safe inside her own body—whatever “solution” she’d found—had become part of who she thought she was.

Taking it away was not just confiscating pills: it was touching the scaffolding of her identity. Which meant we would have to replace it with something real. Something supervised. Something that didn’t rely on fear.

And we would have to do it without breaking her.

## Scene 30
### Discuss

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ab.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

Absolutely happy to have a look. You’ve done something really strong here: the *Wardrobe-as-a-body* opening is clean, confident, and lived-in… and the “Brush” sequence is quietly intimate without turning saccharine. Then the pivot into the bag reveal lands like a trapdoor. Structurally, it works.

Below is a proper edit pass: (1) what’s working, (2) what’s wobbling, (3) concrete line fixes/typos, (4) a “polish” variant for a few key passages so you can compare tone.

---

### 1) What’s already working
(and why it works)

#### Wardrobe’s rhythm feels earned

“Tools had homes. Labels existed. The ledger sat where it belonged…” is exactly the kind of procedural calm that signals *women-in-competence-mode*, not “we’re surviving.” It communicates culture.

#### Charli’s shift is shown
not announced

You do give us one line of summary (“Because she was less afraid.”) but most of it is behavioural: early-ness as preference, laughter that stays in the air, no flinch at the hook. That’s excellent.

#### “Brush” is intimate
without being indulgent

The brush sounds; ends-up technique; “No pulling. No fuss.” This reads as *care expressed through skill*. That’s very Wardrobe.

#### The confrontation
...is standards-first

Celeste doesn’t spiral, doesn’t soothe first, doesn’t ask permission to lead. She just leads. “Answer me.” “Yes.” “I’m taking this.” That spine is perfect for your thematic world.

---

### 2) What I’d strengthen
(without changing your intent)


---
1) The brush scene: keep the room moving, but clarify who’s where

It’s already good, but you can make the spatial choreography even clearer with one or two anchoring beats—especially because this is a “public intimacy” moment: Charli is being handled (competently, neutrally) in front of the women, and the room’s *non-drama* is the point.

Small tweak suggestion: before “Sit.”, add a single clause that makes it obvious you’re already near her (or that you cross the room). It helps the reader *see* the action, not infer it.


---
2) “Charli’s smiled” and the “mushroom” line

* “Charli’s smiled” is just a typo, but it’s in a high-payoff moment. Fix it so the smile lands.
* The mushroom line is funny, but you might want to decide whether Lucy is being *helpfully blunt* or *performing bluntness* for social cover. If you want Lucy to remain the “no performance” girl, make it slightly more technical and less punchline-y, while still dry.


---
3) The medical detail: one tiny correction for credibility

In-story, you call spironolactone “puberty-blocker.” It’s not usually described that way; it’s an anti-androgen (commonly used as a testosterone blocker in some gender-affirming regimens, and also used for acne, hirsutism, etc.). If you keep “puberty blocker,” readers who know will twitch.

Easy fix: Celeste can think: “Anti-androgen. Testosterone blocker.” You still get the same *risk / secrecy / oversight* beat, but it reads more precise.


---
4) Celeste’s “I don’t hate you” beat is great—tighten the paragraph around it

That section is emotionally right, but there’s a small repetition of “old Charlie / disappearing Charlie” that could be sharpened. You can keep one descriptor and let the rest be behaviour: shoulders folding, gaze dropping, towel as armour. You already have towel-as-armour later; lean on that and cut one “old version” mention.


---
5) Raise Lauren’s presence by one notch (micro-tone)

Lauren’s response is already mother-coded and controlled, which is good. If you want to keep *women firm with the world*, you can give her one line that’s less tremble and more *decision*. Something like: “Thank you for telling me. I’m on my way. Don’t let her talk you out of the table.” (Not those exact words—just that energy.)

---

### 3) Typos
& micro-line fixes (quick sweep)

These are the ones that jumped out immediately:

* **“Tt was not with the discipline…”** → “It was not…”
* **“Sarah, perched like a judgmental crow…”** (great) but consider whether “judgmental” is *too evaluative* for Celeste’s POV; if Celeste respects Sarah’s standards, “perched like a crow” alone does the work.
* **“Charli’s smiled”** → “Charli smiled”
* **“accross”** → “across”
* **“I look her, steady.”** → “I looked at her, steady.” / “I held her in a steady look.”
* **“Not on online forums”** → “Not on online forums” is slightly clunky; “Not through online forums” or “Not from online forums.”
* **“Whatever the pathway is going forward”** → “Whatever the pathway is from here”
* **“who… understand this”** → if you want crispness: “who understand this” (the ellipsis softens a line that should be firm)

Optional rhythm tweaks:

* **“She had become... easier to look at.”** The ellipsis is doing a lot. You could make it sharper: “She had become easier to look at.” Then let the next sentence carry the nuance.

---

### 4) A small “polish pass”
on two key sections (so you can compare)


---
1) The brush moment (light polish, same content)

Here’s a tightened version of the brush beats that keeps your intent intact and just smooths the language:

> Charli stepped toward the mirror with a comb, uncertain.
>
> I moved without thinking.
>
> “Sit.”
>
> She looked at me as if I’d told her to walk into the ocean. Then she sat—carefully, obediently—still holding her breath a little, like she hadn’t earned the chair.
>
> I reached for the brush. Ordinary. Wooden handle, bristles clogged with hair. When I drew it through the first time, Charli went very still.
>
> Not tense. Not flinching. *Attentive.*
>
> The brush made that low, dry sound it makes on clean, long hair. I worked from the ends up. Untangle. Smooth. Part. No pulling. No fuss.
>
> “Hold your head,” I said. “Don’t tip back.”
>
> “Yes,” she murmured—then the old reflex, soft as a tic: “Sorry.”
>
> I stopped the brush for half a beat and shook my head.
>
> “Don’t apologise,” I said, flat. “Just hold still.”
>
> “Okay.”

If you like, you can keep your original but steal the *Attentive* line; it’s a nice single-word pin.


---
2) The bottle reveal + first interrogation (tighten & precision)

This is where precision really helps: the scene gets more frightening if Celeste’s thoughts are clinical.

> Inside, tucked under folded cloth and a small notebook, was a pharmacy bottle. White plastic. Printed label.
>
> My stomach dropped before my mind caught up.
>
> **Spironolactone.**
>
> The name sat there like a fact that refused softening. Anti-androgen. Testosterone blocker. Prescription-only.
>
> The bottle was nearly empty—empty enough to make the decision behind it feel old, not impulsive.
>
> She’d told me nothing.
>
> The first heat in me was anger—sharp, immediate. Not at her. At the risk. At the secrecy. At the idea of her body becoming a private experiment with no oversight, no bloodwork, no adult watching the numbers.
>
> Then the colder understanding arrived: this wasn’t rebellion.
>
> It was a solution.
>
> I set the bottle on the kitchen table and waited.

Then your “Where did you get it?” sequence can remain almost exactly as-is; it already plays.

---

### 5) One craft note:
your ending lands—don’t blunt it with too much explanation

Your last paragraph is excellent (“scaffolding of her identity”). The only risk is adding *one more* explanatory sentence after it, which would slightly dilute the final sting.

As written, you end on: “And we would have to do it without breaking her.” That’s a clean door-slam. Keep that.

---

### 6) push the theme
If you want to push the theme harder (without cruelty)

Right now Celeste is firm and protective. If you want a *touch* more of that Wardrobe doctrine—standards over sentiment—without making Celeste cold, you can add one line when Charli says “But it was working.”

Celeste can answer with something like:

* “So does a roulette wheel, right up until it doesn’t.”
* “Working isn’t the same as safe.”
* “Working without oversight is luck. We don’t build a life on luck.”

That line would reinforce the women-led competence ethic: **we don’t wing bodies.**

---

If you’d like, I can do a full continuity pass next (not rewriting—just: pronouns, character voice consistency, and the “camera” of Celeste POV), and then a second pass where we deliberately tune the *temperature* of Celeste’s firmness (more steel vs more warmth) so you can choose the exact flavour you want for Scene 30.

---

[Q]  
At this stage, Emily, Celeste is going to realise that she can no longer view Charli's move towards womanhood dispassionately... it is having a profound effect on her. She is going to realise that she'd always seen the woman in Charli. What does surprise her is her emotional response to Charli's becoming what she'd "seen" all along, seeing without realising what she was seeing. She was falling in love with Charli, which makes Charli putting herself in such danger infinitely more difficult to deal with. Celeste has to *force* herself to "be the adult" more and more: her emotional investment is making keeping her distance increasingly difficult.

This is all backstory for your benefit, Emily. So no, I want her to sound less like Mara and Wardrobe, now. Her tone is **slowly** going to ease. She'll still be the same Celeste: in command, decision-maker, adult. But, slightly softer.

Does that make sense?

---

[A]
Yes — it makes *perfect* sense. And it’s a gorgeous hinge for Celeste’s voice 😌✨

What you’re describing is *not* “Celeste becomes weak.” It’s “Celeste becomes **invested**.” Her authority stays intact — but the *temperature* shifts. The command is still there; the edge becomes less “policy” and more “I’m holding you up and I’m scared what happens if I don’t.”

So: **same spine, softer hands.** 💛

Here are the most reliable ways to do that on the page, *without* turning her into Mara or making her sentimental.

---

### softening Celeste
How to soften Celeste while keeping her in command


---
1) Keep the decisions hard, make the delivery slower

Mara = clipped.
Softer Celeste = measured, low, deliberate — like she’s choosing words that won’t injure.

* Mara: “Answer me.”
* Celeste (soft command): “Charli. Look at me. Answer me.”

Same authority, different care.


---
2) Let her *notice Charli as a person* more often than “as a task”

In your current draft, Celeste’s perception is very Wardrobe/tool-oriented (seam strain, pin tension). Keep *some* of that, but sprinkle in **bodily empathy**:

* the damp hair at shoulders
* the towel as armour
* the way Charli’s voice thins
* the way fear makes her small

These details soften Celeste’s gaze without softening her boundaries.


---
3) Give Celeste one or two “caught” moments — quickly mastered

This is the magic: the reader sees the emotional flare *and* sees Celeste clamp down to protect Charli.

Example pattern:

> I wanted to pull her in.
> I didn’t.
> I made my voice steady instead.

That reads as: love is present, but it serves leadership, not need.


---
4) Replace “standards not sentiment” framing with “safe, not alone”

You can keep your “boring appointments” line (it’s brilliant), but frame it as a promise, not a doctrine.

* “This is not how we do it.” (Wardrobe voice)
* “We’re not doing this alone.” (Celeste-in-love voice)

Same outcome, softer motive.

---

### Concrete swaps
in your Scene 30 confrontation (minimal changes, big effect)

### A) The first interrogation beat

**Current:**

> “Where did you get it?”
> My voice was quiet. Controlled. Adult.

**Soft-command Celeste:**

> “Where did you get it?”
> I kept my voice low. Not gentle — *steady*.

This removes “Adult” as a label (Wardrobe-ish) and lets the steadiness do the work.

### B) The “Answer me” line

**Current:**

> “Answer me.”

**Softer, still in charge:**

> “Charli. Answer me.”

Using her name is intimacy *and* authority.

### C) The “This is not how we do it” paragraph

**Current:**

> “This is not how we do it.” I look her, steady…

**Softer version (same boundary):**

> “This isn’t how we do it,” I said. Not as a scold — as a line I wouldn’t let us step over. “Not like this. Not alone.”

It keeps the “no” but makes it protective rather than procedural.

### D) The confiscation

**Current:**

> “I’m taking this.”
> … “Yes.” The word came out clean. Final.

**Softer, still final:**

> “I’m taking this,” I said. Final — but not cruel.
> Her eyes went wide.
> “No—”
> “Yes,” I said quietly. “Because I’m not losing you to something you bought off the internet.”

That last clause is *the love leak*. It changes everything.

### E) Calling Lauren

Right now, Celeste is crisp and managerial (which is fine), but this moment can show her new vulnerability **without** losing competence:

**Suggested tweak:**

> “I found spironolactone in Charli’s bag,” I said. “She’s been taking it for months.”
> (beat)
> “She’s safe. I’m with her. But I need you here.”

That “I need you here” is softer, and it doesn’t weaken Celeste — it *enlists* another woman.

---

## A short “tone sample” rewrite of the key kitchen section (so you can feel it)

Here’s a version of the bottle scene with your exact beats, just eased:

> She came into the kitchen in a t-shirt and track pants, hair damp and loose around her shoulders — relaxed in a way that still startled me.
>
> Then she saw the bottle.
>
> The light left her face. Not gradually. All at once — like a switch. She stopped so hard it was almost comical, except nothing about it was funny.
>
> Her eyes flicked to mine, then down to the label, then back up again.
>
> In that instant, she wasn’t the Charli who laughed in Wardrobe. She was braced. Waiting for the cost.
>
> “Where did you get it?”
>
> I kept my voice low. Steady.
>
> Charli’s throat moved. “I—”
>
> “Charli.” I said her name like a hand on a shoulder. “Answer me.”
>
> “Online,” she whispered.
>
> “How long?”
>
> Her eyes dropped.
>
> “How long,” I repeated — softer, not less firm.
>
> “Almost four months.”
>
> The number landed in my body before it landed in my mind. Four months of private courage. Four months of private risk. Four months of her building a life on something she couldn’t afford to lose.
>
> “Why didn’t you tell me?”
>
> Her fingers twisted into the towel. She didn’t look up.
>
> “I didn’t want…” Her voice cracked. “I didn’t want it to go away.”
>
> “What,” I asked, gently and dangerously, “didn’t you want to go away?”
>
> And then she said it — not neatly, not bravely. Just honestly: the girls, the room, me. The terror of biology catching up with her.
>
> I let her finish. I made myself let her finish.
>
> “Okay,” I said at last. “Listen to me.”
>
> I put my hand over the bottle — not dramatic. Not possessive. Simply claiming responsibility.
>
> “I’m taking this,” I said. “Not as punishment. As harm control.”
>
> Her breath hitched.
>
> “We are not doing this alone, Charli.”

That is “soft Celeste”: still decisive, but now emotionally tethered.

---

## One final craft note (this will help you everywhere)

As Celeste falls in love, you can let **the softness appear most in three places**:

1. when she says Charli’s name
2. when she promises safety (“I’m with you / we’ll do this properly”)
3. when she chooses not to touch — and the reader feels the restraint

That restraint becomes romantic without ever becoming gooey. 💫

If you want, I can do a full “soft-Celeste” pass on the *whole* second half (from “That evening, at home…” onward), preserving every plot beat and most of your sentences — just tuning diction, cadence, and a couple of emotional micro-reveals so her love is present but controlled.

---

[Q]  
Could I ask you to do a full pass (correcting typos and such) of the Scene, with emphasis - as you so beautifully suggest - on Celeste's emotional investment?

---

[A]
Of course, Robyn 💛✨ Here’s a full, clean pass of Scene 30 with typos corrected, cadence smoothed, and Celeste’s emotional investment threaded in—quietly, steadily—without weakening her authority. She stays the decision-maker. The difference is the *breath* between commands… and the way her restraint starts to feel like effort.

**Scene 30 — “The Brush” (Celeste POV) — Revised Pass**

---

Wardrobe had learned, over the last three months, to run like a body instead of a panic. Not because the work was easier—if anything it had become more precise, more demanding—but because the women inside it had stopped wasting effort on uncertainty.

Tools had homes. Labels existed. The ledger sat where it belonged: open when it needed to be open, shut when it didn’t. Even Mara’s silences had started to feel less like weather and more like method.

And Charli?

Charli moved through the room as if she’d finally stopped waiting to be told she was in the way.

She arrived early, same as always, but the early-ness had changed. It used to feel like an apology; now it felt like preference. She hung her bag on the hook without flinching. Washed her hands with the same thoroughness, but without the old tremor of performance. She laughed sometimes, quietly, and the laugh stayed in the air instead of disappearing the second it appeared.

She had become easier to look at. Not because she was “prettier” or because she was trying harder.

Because she was less afraid.

Mara set the next test on the table without ceremony: a cap and kerchief combination we’d been refining for the Faire women—something that had to survive heat, sweat, pins, movement, and the indignity of being yanked off and shoved into a tote bag between scenes.

“Hair,” Mara said, glancing at Charli as if the word was a tool she was calling for. “Fix it.”

Charli touched her own hair reflexively, as if the problem had just been named aloud. She had tied it back in her customary scruffy ponytail. It was not with the discipline the cap required. Loose strands would catch. Pins would slip. The whole thing would migrate.

Tahlia, measuring a sleeve nearby, made a small amused noise. Lucy didn’t look up from her work. Sarah, perched like a crow on a stool, watched with the bright interest she reserved for social developments.

Charli stepped toward the mirror with a comb, uncertain.

I moved without thinking.

“Sit.”

Charli looked at me as if I’d told her to walk into the ocean. Then she sat—carefully, obediently—still holding her breath a little, like she wasn’t sure she’d earned the chair.

I reached for the brush. It was ordinary: wooden handle, bristles clogged with hair. When I drew it through her hair the first time, Charli went very still.

Not tense. Not flinching.

Attentive.

The brush made that low, dry sound a brush makes on clean, long hair. I worked from the ends up, practical. Untangle. Smooth. Part. No pulling. No fuss.

“Hold your head,” I said. “Don’t tip back.”

“Yes,” she murmured, and then—an old reflex, soft as a bruise: “Sorry.”

I stopped the brush for half a beat and shook my head.

“Don’t apologise,” I said, flat. Not harsh. Just final. “Just hold still.”

“Okay.”

The room didn’t pause around us.

I gathered her hair at the nape, measured the tension with my fingers, and began to twist it into a coil that would sit properly beneath the cap. Pins went in with the same economy we used for everything: enough to hold, not so many it became a hedgehog. Sarah’s voice floated over from her stool.

“Look at that,” she said, pleased. “Civilisation.”

Charli smiled—an actual smile that reached her eyes.

Lucy looked up long enough to say, “If she keeps her head like that, the cap will sit properly. If she doesn’t, it’ll ride.”

“Thank you,” Charli said automatically.

Lucy’s expression remained what it always was. “It’s just geometry.”

I set the cap on Charli’s head and adjusted the angle. The kerchief followed, tied firmly enough to hold, not so tight it would dig. I checked the line at the forehead, the way the fabric framed her face.

For a second—only a second—I saw it.

Not a costume. Not a test.

A rightness so quiet it almost made me swallow.

As if the room around her had finally stopped arguing with something inside her body.

“Turn your head left.”

She turned.

“Right.”

She turned.

“Good.”

Mara glanced over, saw the fit, and gave a single curt nod: approval, in Mara’s language.

“Now move,” Mara said. “Sweat. Bend. Prove it.”

Charli rose and began the wear-test—bending to reach fabric on the lower shelves, turning quickly, lifting her arms, moving through the narrow spaces between tables. The cap held. The kerchief held. The pins did their job.

Tahlia watched her with a faint grin. Bree appeared in the doorway mid-test, took one look, and beamed.

“Oh, she looks *proper Missy*!”

The room laughed, and I saw Charli go pink: a soft, bashful warmth.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “Right then. She’s coming tonight.”

“She’s coming,” Tahlia echoed.

The day moved on.

The cap survived sweat and motion. The kerchief didn’t slip. The ledger received its notes. Mara’s shears kept snicking. The room kept laughing.

And Charli kept laughing with it.

Not small.

Real.

---

That evening, at home, the quiet hit me the way it always did after Wardrobe: like walking out of a river and realising your ears had been full of water.

Charli was in the shower. I could hear the muted rush behind the bathroom door, the steady sound of water striking tile. I moved through the apartment, tidying without thinking. Habit. Reset the space. Put things back where they belonged.

Her bag was on the chair.

Not rummaged through. Not spilled open. Just… placed there, as if it had been arranged to look casual.

I don’t know what made me look. It wasn’t suspicion, not at first. It was the same part of my brain that noticed seam strain and pin tension—the part that registered when something was *slightly too controlled*.

I lifted the bag and felt the weight shift in a way that didn’t match fabric.

I opened it.

Inside, tucked under folded cloth and a small notebook, was a pharmacy bottle. White plastic. Printed label.

My stomach dropped before my mind caught up.

**Spironolactone.**

The name sat on the label like a fact that refused to be softened by context. I’d heard of it—an anti-androgen, a testosterone blocker. Prescription-only.

It was almost empty. Empty enough to make the decision behind it feel old, not impulsive.

She had told me nothing about this.

My first impulse was anger: hot and sharp and immediate.

Not at her.

At the risk.

At the secrecy.

At the thought of her taking *anything* unsupervised, unmonitored, unrecorded—her body becoming a private experiment without safeguards, without bloodwork, without anyone checking what it was doing to her.

And then a colder realisation arrived, steady enough to make me still: this wasn’t rebellion.

This was a solution.

A private solution. *Her* solution.

A girl trying to keep her place in a room of women by any means available.

I closed the bag carefully, as if the bottle might explode.

Then I opened it again and took the bottle out. There was no point pretending I hadn’t seen it. There was no point leaving it there like a trap. The bottle was evidence; it represented danger.

I set it on the kitchen table and waited.

The shower stopped. A door opened. Footsteps. The soft sound of Charli’s towel rubbing through her hair.

She came into the kitchen in a t-shirt and track pants, damp hair loose around her shoulders, face relaxed in a way I hadn’t seen months ago. She looked… good. Warmer. Lighter.

Then she saw the bottle.

All the light left her face. She stopped so abruptly it was like she’d hit a wall. Her eyes flicked to mine, then down to the bottle, then back up to my face.

In that moment, she wasn’t Charli of the workroom—laughing, included, adopted.

She was braced. Terrified. Trying to calculate what it would cost to be caught wanting.

“Where did you get it?”

My voice came out quiet. Low. The way you speak when you’re trying not to add fear to fear.

Charli’s throat moved. “I—”

“Charli.” I said her name like a hand placed firmly on a shoulder. “Answer me.”

She swallowed. “Online.”

“How long?”

Her eyes dropped.

“How long,” I repeated, and I heard my own restraint in it—how carefully I was keeping the edge out. She breathed in, shallow.

“Almost four months.”

Four months.

Long enough for it to become her routine. Long enough for it to affect her body. Long enough for her to build her happiness on it.

I let my breath out through my nose, slow.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

Charli’s hands twisted in the edge of her towel. She didn’t look up.

“I didn’t want…” she began, and her voice cracked. “I didn’t want it to go away.”

“Didn’t want *what* to go away?”

The question wasn’t cruel. But it had weight; it made her shiver. She shook her head, eyes bright.

“The… the girls. The room. You. I didn’t want…” She took in a shuddering breath. Then the words came spilling out, messy and honest.

“I was changing. It was horrible. The changes I didn’t think would happen were… happening. It made me sick. I was scared I was going to turn…”

She didn’t finish.

She didn’t have to.

There it was.

Not vanity.

Fear.

Fear of being returned to the category that had always hurt, because biology was betraying her.

I felt something in me tighten—an instinct to step forward and wrap her up and promise everything at once.

I didn’t.

I forced myself to stay where I was, to keep my voice steady, to give her structure instead of comfort that would collapse the moment the next fear arrived.

“This is not how we do it,” I said. Slower than I wanted to. “This isn’t safe. This isn’t supervised.”

Charli flinched as if the words were a slap.

I softened the delivery without softening the boundary.

“You don’t get to do things to your body like a private trial and hope it works out.”

Her lips trembled. “But it was *working*.”

The way she said it—small, desperate—made my chest ache. Because of course it had been working. It had given her a sense of control. It had quieted the terror chewing at her. It had let her smile without fear.

And she had done it alone.

I reached out and put my hand over the bottle.

Not possessive. Not dramatic.

Simply covering it. Claiming responsibility.

“I’m taking this.”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No—” she whispered, panic and pleading chasing each other across her face.

“Yes.”

The word came out clean. Final.

Then, after a beat—because I could feel how hard she was trying not to fall apart—I added, quieter:

“Not as punishment.”

Her breath hitched.

“As harm control,” I said. “And because I’m not leaving you to manage this by yourself.”

Charli stared at me like she was trying to work out whether she’d heard that last part correctly.

“Look,” I said, and I kept my voice as gentle as I could without letting it turn vague, “you’re not being punished, Charli. But you *cannot* do this without medical oversight. Do you understand me?”

Her breath trembled in her throat. A long moment passed. Finally, she nodded, small.

“Yes,” she whispered.

I picked up my phone.

“Who are you calling?” she asked, voice tight.

“Your mum.”

Her face went white.

“Mum—”

“Charli, listen.” The firmness in my voice surprised me—because it was threaded with something else now, something I didn’t want her to see. “We are not doing this alone. We are not keeping secrets that can harm you. Your mum needs to know. We need to get you professional help.”

Charli seemed to shrink into herself. She sat silent while I retrieved my phone. When I returned to the kitchen, she looked like she’d stepped backward through time: shoulders rounded, towel clutched like armour, eyes shining with unspilled tears.

“Please don’t hate me.”

That was worse than finding the bottle.

I stepped closer. I wanted—instinctively—to comfort her with softness, to wrap her in reassurance until she stopped trembling.

And I could feel, in the same breath, the danger of that: how easily comfort could become a hook. How quickly she could learn to rely on me as a shelter instead of learning to stand.

So I anchored her with fact.

“Charli,” I said, “I don’t hate you.” I watched her swallow. “I *am* angry you did something unsafe. And I’m angry you thought you had to do it alone. But I do not hate you.”

A tear slid down her cheek. She wiped it away quickly, ashamed of it.

I dialled.

When Lauren answered, I didn’t waste words.

“I found spironolactone in Charli’s bag,” I said. “Charli got it online. She’s been taking it for months.”

A pause on the line—silence with weight.

Then Lauren’s voice, tight but present: “Is she okay right now?”

“She’s here,” I said. “She’s safe. But this can’t continue.”

Another pause. I could hear Lauren breathing—holding herself together the way mothers do when the world tries to fracture them.

“I’m coming over,” she said.

“Please,” I replied. “We need a plan. We need medical oversight—bloodwork, specialists. People who actually understand this. Whatever the pathway is from here, we do it properly.”

Lauren’s voice steadied on the word properly, as if she was grabbing it with both hands.

“Yes,” she said quietly. “Yes. We do it properly.”

I ended the call and looked at Charli.

She stood in the kitchen with her towel clutched to her chest, face raw, eyes frightened, fixed on me.

“We are going to get you help with this,” I said. “Not through online forums. Not through secrecy. This is a serious step.”

Charli nodded, the hopelessness slowly easing from her shoulders. Her red eyes sought mine. I held her gaze.

“This will be a series of boring appointments,” I said, letting the promise be what it was—structure, safety. “Questions. Paperwork. Waiting.”

Her mouth trembled.

“But it will be safe,” I finished. “And you won’t do it by yourself.”

“Okay.”

The word came out in a whisper. And in that whisper I heard everything she hadn’t said:

*I’m tired of being afraid. I’m tired of pretending I don’t want this. I’m tired of losing whatever I touch.*

“We start tomorrow.”

Charli nodded again.

In that nod I saw the return of the new Charli—the one who understood surrender to structure, structure she’d been craving, structure she’d tried to replace with a bottle and a secret.

In the ensuing quiet, the apartment felt like Wardrobe did when the lights went down: still, intentional, waiting.

And for the first time, I understood with a clarity that made me almost cold:

Whatever Charli had done to keep her happiness safe inside her own body—whatever solution she’d found—had become part of who she thought she was.

Taking it away was not just confiscating pills.

It was touching the scaffolding of her identity.

Which meant we would have to replace it with something real. Something supervised. Something that didn’t rely on fear.

And we would have to do it without breaking her.

---

If you want, next pass I can **increase the romantic undertone by half a notch**—not with declarations, but with *one or two* carefully placed Celeste slips (a hand that lingers one beat too long; a thought she shuts down mid-sentence; a flash of possessive fear that she immediately converts into action). Subtle, but unmistakable. 💛

---

[Q]  
Oh, that would be ideal, Emily!

---

[A]
Perfect 😌💛 Here’s that **“half a notch”** pass—still subtle, still disciplined, but with a few *unmistakable* Celeste slips: a hand that lingers a beat too long, a thought she shuts down mid-breath, a flash of possessive fear she converts into action.

I’ve kept it clean and non-operatic: **no declarations, no melodrama**—just the gradual, dangerous fact of her investment showing through the seams.

**Scene 30 — “The Brush” (Celeste POV) — Soft-Romantic Undertone Pass**

---

Wardrobe had learned, over the last three months, to run like a body instead of a panic. Not because the work was easier—if anything it had become more precise, more demanding—but because the women inside it had stopped wasting effort on uncertainty.

Tools had homes. Labels existed. The ledger sat where it belonged: open when it needed to be open, shut when it didn’t. Even Mara’s silences had started to feel less like weather and more like method.

And Charli?

Charli moved through the room as if she’d finally stopped waiting to be told she was in the way.

She arrived early, same as always, but the early-ness had changed. It used to feel like an apology; now it felt like preference. She hung her bag on the hook without flinching. Washed her hands with the same thoroughness, but without the old tremor of performance. She laughed sometimes, quietly, and the laugh stayed in the air instead of disappearing the second it appeared.

She had become easier to look at. Not because she was “prettier” or because she was trying harder.

Because she was less afraid.

And because—without meaning to—she’d begun to occupy her own skin as if it belonged to her.

Mara set the next test on the table without ceremony: a cap and kerchief combination we’d been refining for the Faire women—something that had to survive heat, sweat, pins, movement, and the indignity of being yanked off and shoved into a tote bag between scenes.

“Hair,” Mara said, glancing at Charli as if the word was a tool she was calling for. “Fix it.”

Charli touched her own hair reflexively, as if the problem had just been named aloud. She had tied it back in her customary scruffy ponytail. It was not with the discipline the cap required. Loose strands would catch. Pins would slip. The whole thing would migrate.

Tahlia, measuring a sleeve nearby, made a small amused noise. Lucy didn’t look up from her work. Sarah, perched like a crow on a stool, watched with the bright interest she reserved for social developments.

Charli stepped toward the mirror with a comb, uncertain.

I moved without thinking.

“Sit.”

Charli looked at me as if I’d told her to walk into the ocean. Then she sat—carefully, obediently—still holding her breath a little, like she wasn’t sure she’d earned the chair.

I reached for the brush. It was ordinary: wooden handle, bristles clogged with hair.

When I drew it through her hair the first time, Charli went very still.

Not tense. Not flinching.

Attentive.

That attention always did something to me. Not the attention itself—the way she *trusted* it. The way she let herself be guided without making a show of it.

The brush made that low, dry sound a brush makes on clean, long hair. I worked from the ends up, practical. Untangle. Smooth. Part. No pulling. No fuss.

“Hold your head,” I said. “Don’t tip back.”

“Yes,” she murmured, and then—an old reflex, soft as a bruise: “Sorry.”

I stopped the brush for half a beat.

“Don’t apologise,” I said. Flat. Not harsh. Just final. “Just hold still.”

“Okay.”

The room didn’t pause around us. Mara’s shears kept snicking. Fabric slid. Pins clicked. The kettle somewhere did what kettles do.

I gathered Charli’s hair at the nape, measured the tension with my fingers, and began to twist it into a coil that would sit properly beneath the cap. The nape of her neck was warm from the room and from the shower she’d clearly taken before coming in—clean, faintly soap-scented. My fingers registered it the way they registered everything: temperature, texture, compliance.

And then, annoyingly, something else: a small, involuntary tenderness that made me slow down by half a second.

Pins went in with the same economy we used for everything: enough to hold, not so many it became a hedgehog. Sarah’s voice floated over from her stool.

“Look at that,” she said, pleased. “Civilisation.”

Charli smiled—an actual smile that reached her eyes.

Lucy looked up long enough to say, “If she keeps her head like that, the cap will sit properly. If she doesn’t, it’ll ride.”

“Thank you,” Charli said automatically.

Lucy’s expression remained what it always was. “It’s just geometry.”

I set the cap on Charli’s head and adjusted the angle. The kerchief followed, tied firmly enough to hold, not so tight it would dig. I checked the line at the forehead, the way the fabric framed her face.

For a second—only a second—I saw it.

Not a costume. Not a test.

A rightness so quiet it almost made me swallow.

As if the room around her had finally stopped arguing with something inside her body.

I should have stepped back then. I should have treated it like any other fit check.

Instead, my hand lingered at her temple a fraction too long, flattening a flyaway strand that didn’t matter.

Charli didn’t move. She simply breathed, steady, as if she’d decided this was safe.

I made myself withdraw.

“Turn your head left.”

She turned.

“Right.”

She turned.

“Good.”

Mara glanced over, saw the fit, and gave a single curt nod: approval, in Mara’s language.

“Now move,” Mara said. “Sweat. Bend. Prove it.”

Charli rose and began the wear-test—bending to reach fabric on the lower shelves, turning quickly, lifting her arms, moving through the narrow spaces between tables. The cap held. The kerchief held. The pins did their job.

Tahlia watched her with a faint grin. Bree appeared in the doorway mid-test, took one look, and beamed.

“Oh, she looks *proper Missy*!”

The room laughed, and I saw Charli go pink: a soft, bashful warmth.

Bree clapped once, delighted. “Right then. She’s coming tonight.”

“She’s coming,” Tahlia echoed.

Charli glanced at me—just once—like she was checking whether I approved of *tonight*, not just the cap.

I gave her a small nod. Professional. Calm.

And felt, under that calm, the strange protective satisfaction of it.

The day moved on.

The cap survived sweat and motion. The kerchief didn’t slip. The ledger received its notes. Mara’s shears kept snicking. The room kept laughing.

And Charli kept laughing with it.

Not small.

Real.

---

That evening, at home, the quiet hit me the way it always did after Wardrobe: like walking out of a river and realising your ears had been full of water.

Charli was in the shower. I could hear the muted rush behind the bathroom door, the steady sound of water striking tile. I moved through the apartment, tidying without thinking. Habit. Reset the space. Put things back where they belonged.

Her bag was on the chair.

Not rummaged through. Not spilled open. Just… placed there, as if it had been arranged to look casual.

I don’t know what made me look. It wasn’t suspicion, not at first. It was the same part of my brain that noticed seam strain and pin tension—the part that registered when something was *slightly too controlled*.

I lifted the bag and felt the weight shift in a way that didn’t match fabric.

I opened it.

Inside, tucked under folded cloth and a small notebook, was a pharmacy bottle. White plastic. Printed label.

My stomach dropped before my mind caught up.

**Spironolactone.**

The name sat on the label like a fact that refused to be softened by context. I’d heard of it—an anti-androgen, a testosterone blocker. Prescription-only.

It was almost empty. Empty enough to make the decision behind it feel old, not impulsive.

For a moment I couldn’t move.

Not because I didn’t know what to do.

Because the first thought in me wasn’t policy or risk or responsibility.

It was: *I could lose her.*

Not in the abstract. Not in a headline. In my kitchen.

I shut that thought down so hard it felt like biting my own tongue.

My next impulse was anger: hot and sharp and immediate.

Not at her.

At the risk.

At the secrecy.

At the thought of her taking *anything* unsupervised, unmonitored, unrecorded—her body becoming a private experiment without safeguards, without bloodwork, without anyone checking what it was doing to her.

And then a colder realisation arrived, steady enough to make me still: this wasn’t rebellion.

This was a solution.

A private solution. *Her* solution.

A girl trying to keep her place in a room of women by any means available.

I closed the bag carefully, as if the bottle might explode.

Then I opened it again and took the bottle out. There was no point pretending I hadn’t seen it. There was no point leaving it there like a trap. The bottle was evidence; it represented danger.

I set it on the kitchen table and waited.

The shower stopped. A door opened. Footsteps. The soft sound of Charli’s towel rubbing through her hair.

She came into the kitchen in a t-shirt and track pants, damp hair loose around her shoulders, face relaxed in a way I hadn’t seen months ago. She looked… good. Warm. Lighter.

The sight of that warmth, arriving right before the fall, made something in me tighten.

Then she saw the bottle.

All the light left her face. She stopped so abruptly it was like she’d hit a wall. Her eyes flicked to mine, then down to the bottle, then back up.

In that moment, she wasn’t Charli of the workroom—laughing, included, adopted.

She was braced. Terrified. Trying to calculate what it would cost to be caught wanting.

“Where did you get it?”

My voice came out quiet. Low. The way you speak when you’re trying not to add fear to fear.

Charli’s throat moved. “I—”

“Charli.” I said her name like a hand placed firmly on a shoulder. “Answer me.”

She swallowed. “Online.”

“How long?”

Her eyes dropped.

“How long,” I repeated, and I heard my own restraint in it—how carefully I was keeping the edge out. She breathed in, shallow.

“Almost four months.”

Four months.

Long enough for it to become her routine. Long enough for it to affect her body. Long enough for her to build her happiness on it.

I let my breath out through my nose, slow.

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

Charli’s hands twisted in the edge of her towel. She didn’t look up.

“I didn’t want…” she began, and her voice cracked. “I didn’t want it to go away.”

“Didn’t want *what* to go away?”

The question wasn’t cruel. But it had weight; it made her shiver. She shook her head, eyes bright.

“The… the girls. The room. You. I didn’t want…” She took in a shuddering breath. Then the words came spilling out, messy and honest.

“I was changing. It was horrible. The changes I didn’t think would happen were… happening. It made me sick. I was scared I was going to turn…”

She didn’t finish.

She didn’t have to.

There it was.

Not vanity.

Fear.

Fear of being returned to the category that had always hurt, because biology was betraying her.

I felt that instinct again—sharp, urgent—an urge to close the distance, to put my arms around her and make her stop shaking.

And I hated myself, a little, for how badly I wanted it.

I didn’t move.

I forced myself to stay where I was, to keep my voice steady, to give her structure instead of comfort that would collapse the moment the next fear arrived.

“This is not how we do it,” I said. Slower than I wanted to. “This isn’t safe. This isn’t supervised.”

Charli flinched as if the words were a slap.

I softened the delivery without softening the boundary.

“You don’t get to do things to your body like a private trial and hope it works out.”

Her lips trembled. “But it was *working*.”

The way she said it—small, desperate—made my chest ache. Because of course it had been working. It had given her a sense of control. It had quieted the terror chewing at her. It had let her smile without fear.

And she had done it alone.

I reached out and put my hand over the bottle.

Not possessive. Not dramatic.

Simply covering it. Claiming responsibility.

“I’m taking this.”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No—” she whispered, panic and pleading chasing each other across her face.

“Yes.”

The word came out clean. Final.

Then, after a beat—because I could see her tipping toward panic—I added, quieter:

“Not as punishment.”

Her breath hitched.

“As harm control,” I said. “And because I’m not leaving you to manage this by yourself.”

Charli stared at me like she was trying to work out whether she’d heard that last part correctly.

“Look,” I said, and I kept my voice as gentle as I could without letting it turn vague, “you’re not being punished, Charli. But you *cannot* do this without medical oversight. Do you understand me?”

Her breath trembled in her throat. A long moment passed. Finally, she nodded, small.

“Yes,” she whispered.

I picked up my phone.

“Who are you calling?” she asked, voice tight.

“Your mum.”

Her face went white.

“Mum—”

“Charli, listen.” The firmness in my voice surprised me—because it was threaded with something else now, something I didn’t want her to see. “We are not doing this alone. We are not keeping secrets that can harm you. Your mum needs to know. We need to get you professional help.”

Charli seemed to shrink into herself. She sat silent while I retrieved my phone. When I returned to the kitchen, she looked like she’d stepped backward through time: shoulders rounded, towel clutched like armour, eyes shining with unspilled tears.

“Please don’t hate me.”

That was worse than finding the bottle.

I stepped closer. I wanted—instinctively—to comfort her with softness, to wrap her in reassurance until she stopped trembling.

And I could feel, in the same breath, the danger of that: how easily comfort could become a hook. How quickly she could learn to rely on me as a shelter instead of learning to stand.

So I anchored her with fact.

“Charli,” I said, “I don’t hate you.” I watched her swallow. “I *am* angry you did something unsafe. And I’m angry you thought you had to do it alone. But I do not hate you.”

A tear slid down her cheek. She wiped it away quickly, ashamed of it.

I dialled.

When Lauren answered, I didn’t waste words.

“I found spironolactone in Charli’s bag,” I said. “Charli got it online. She’s been taking it for months.”

A pause on the line—silence with weight.

Then Lauren’s voice, tight but present: “Is she okay right now?”

“She’s here,” I said. “She’s safe. But this can’t continue.”

Another pause. I could hear Lauren breathing—holding herself together the way mothers do when the world tries to fracture them.

“I’m coming over,” she said.

“Please,” I replied. “We need a plan. We need medical oversight—bloodwork, specialists. People who actually understand this. Whatever the pathway is from here, we do it properly.”

Lauren’s voice steadied on the word properly, as if she was grabbing it with both hands.

“Yes,” she said quietly. “Yes. We do it properly.”

I ended the call and looked at Charli.

She stood in the kitchen with her towel clutched to her chest, face raw, eyes frightened, fixed on me.

“We are going to get you help with this,” I said. “Not through online forums. Not through secrecy. This is a serious step.”

Charli nodded, the hopelessness slowly easing from her shoulders. Her red eyes sought mine.

I held her gaze.

And I let myself, for one heartbeat, simply look at her—at the damp hair, the bare face, the trembling mouth—as if this were not a problem to manage but a person I… cared about more than I had planned to.

I put that away again before it could soften me into uselessness.

“This will be a series of boring appointments,” I said, letting the promise be what it was—structure, safety. “Questions. Paperwork. Waiting.”

Her mouth trembled.

“But it will be safe,” I finished. “And you won’t do it by yourself.”

“Okay.”

The word came out in a whisper. And in that whisper I heard everything she hadn’t said:

*I’m tired of being afraid. I’m tired of pretending I don’t want this. I’m tired of losing whatever I touch.*

“We start tomorrow.”

Charli nodded again.

In that nod I saw the return of the new Charli—the one who understood surrender to structure, structure she’d been craving, structure she’d tried to replace with a bottle and a secret.

In the ensuing quiet, the apartment felt like Wardrobe did when the lights went down: still, intentional, waiting.

And for the first time, I understood with a clarity that made me almost cold:

Whatever Charli had done to keep her happiness safe inside her own body—whatever solution she’d found—had become part of who she thought she was.

Taking it away was not just confiscating pills.

It was touching the scaffolding of her identity.

Which meant we would have to replace it with something real. Something supervised. Something that didn’t rely on fear.

And we would have to do it without breaking her.

If you want to lean *one notch further* (still subtle), the next place to do it is **after Lauren arrives**: Celeste’s composure holds in front of Lauren, but when Charli looks between them—mother and *this woman*—Celeste feels the first flicker of *jealous responsibility* and has to swallow it. Very quiet. Very telling.

Say the word and I’ll draft that arrival beat in the same tone 😌💛

[Q]  
If you think there's enough material for another Scene, we could do that, if you'd like, including what you suggest: lean one notch further (still subtle) after Lauren arrives. Celeste’s composure holds in front of Lauren, but we learn of an internal conflict. Charli looks between them—mother and Celeste—she feels the first flicker of jealous responsibility and has to swallow it. For now. As time progresses, her resolve will slowly weaken.

---

[A]
Yes — there’s *absolutely* enough material for another Scene, and it’s the right place to do it. This “Lauren arrives” beat is where the story can quietly declare: **Celeste is no longer an observer.** She is now *implicated* — emotionally, ethically, and practically.

Below is a new scene that follows directly from Scene 30. I’ve kept it Celeste POV, kept her in command, and let the internal conflict show in small, controlled flashes: a swallow, a withheld touch, a moment of possessive responsibility that she converts into structure.

## **Scene 31 — “The Arrival” (Celeste POV)**

Lauren arrived the way she did everything lately: fast, contained, already braced.

I heard her before I saw her—the firm knock that didn’t ask permission, the quick shift of keys, the familiar scrape of the latch. No hesitation. No dawdle at the threshold. She came in as if the doorway itself was something she could correct by force of will.

When she stepped into the kitchen, her eyes went briefly to me, then quickly to Charli.

Charli had been sitting in the same spot for too long, towel gripped like a security blanket, damp hair still uncombed, face raw from crying. She looked up when Lauren entered, and something in her expression rearranged itself—not relief exactly, not comfort.

More like recognition.

*This is the person who can actually undo me.*

Lauren crossed the room in three steps and stopped in front of her daughter.

For a second, she didn’t touch her.

That restraint—the pause before contact—was so precise it made my throat tighten. It was the kind of restraint you learned the hard way: the knowledge that sometimes touch feels like a verdict.

Then Lauren did what mothers do when they cannot afford theatre.

She cupped Charli’s cheek with her palm, thumb sliding once, gentle.

“You okay?” she asked. The words were soft. The question was not.

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I’m—” she started, then broke. “I didn’t—”

Lauren turned her head, just enough to look at me. Not accusing. Not grateful. Measuring.

I held her gaze.

“She’s safe,” I said. “She’s not in danger *right now*. But it can’t continue.”

Lauren’s hand stayed on Charli’s face. She didn’t stop touching her even while she processed the rest. That told me more than any sentence could have: whatever she was feeling, she wasn’t going to let her daughter be alone inside it.

Charli looked between us. Mother and me. Two women, two kinds of authority.

And there it was—the smallest, sharpest flicker in me.

Not anger. Not rivalry.

Something more primitive than either.

*Mine.*

Not in the possessive sense a man would claim, or a lover would claim, but in the sense that Wardrobe had trained me to feel about vulnerable things under my care: a duty that turned into ownership of outcome. Responsibility so fierce it bordered on jealousy.

I swallowed it before it could touch my face.

I did not want Charli to see it. I did not want Lauren to see it.

I wanted to be the adult.

Lauren’s gaze moved to the bottle. She didn’t pick it up. She didn’t read it again. She didn’t ask for more proof.

She simply nodded, once, and the nod was almost invisible—but it was a decision.

“How long?” she asked Charli.

Charli flinched. Her eyes slid away. “Almost four months.”

Lauren’s hand dropped from Charli’s cheek to her shoulder, firmer now. Anchoring.

“Four months,” Lauren repeated quietly, as if saying the number out loud would make it manageable.

Charli started to shake her head, quick, panicked. “Mum, I— I wasn’t— I didn’t do it because—”

Lauren cut in, not loud, but clean.

“Don’t explain it to me like I’m going to misunderstand,” she said. “I’m your mother. I know why you did it.”

Charli’s breath hitched. Something like shame flared and then collapsed.

Lauren kept her hand on her shoulder.

Then Lauren looked at me again.

“You took it off her,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Yes,” I said. “I’m holding it.”

Lauren’s face did something complicated—relief mixed with fear, as if she didn’t want to admit how grateful she was that someone else had been present for the first collision.

“Thank you,” she said, very quietly.

I nodded once. I didn’t soften. Not yet. Softness can become permission to fall apart, and I needed them both upright.

Charli’s eyes were bright. She looked between us again, like she couldn’t decide which failure she was meant to confess to first.

Lauren’s voice changed then, fractionally. Not gentler. More controlled.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to do this properly.”

Charli blinked. The phrase hit her like a threat.

Lauren glanced at the bottle again and then back to Charli.

“Not ‘properly’ as punishment,” she said. “Properly as in: safe.”

Charli swallowed. “It was safe. I— I checked—”

“No,” Lauren said. Still not loud. “You *read*. You didn’t *check*. You don’t have bloodwork. You don’t have a doctor. You don’t have anyone watching what it’s doing to you.”

Charli flinched at the word watching, as if it sounded like surveillance instead of care.

I understood that too well. I’d watched her in Wardrobe: how she responded to scrutiny like a person expecting to be judged.

Lauren looked at me again.

“She said she bought it online,” Lauren said.

“Yes,” I replied. “Scripted medication. No oversight. No labs. It’s not acceptable.”

Lauren inhaled through her nose, slow. Her jaw tightened.

Then she did something that made my chest tighten again.

She turned to Charli and said, very simply:

“Do you have more?”

Charli’s eyes widened. “No— I—” She hesitated. That hesitation was an answer.

Lauren’s face didn’t change.

Charli rushed, frantic. “No, I mean— I have— there’s— I have a second bottle, but it’s— it’s not— it’s for later—”

Lauren held up her hand. A stop sign made of flesh.

“Where,” she asked.

Charli’s breathing went shallow. Her eyes darted toward the hallway.

“In my room,” she whispered. “In the drawer.”

Lauren’s hand tightened on Charli’s shoulder—not painful, just firm.

“Okay,” she said. “We’re going to get it.”

Charli panicked. “Mum, please—”

Lauren’s voice stayed flat. “Charli.”

The name landed like a hand closing around a moving wrist.

Charli went still.

I watched her obey, and something in me loosened a fraction. Not comfort.

Recognition.

Lauren was the adult too. A real one. A woman who could hold a line without cruelty.

Lauren moved toward the hallway.

Charli looked at me, helpless.

The look did something sharp inside my ribs. It felt like being chosen in a way I hadn’t consented to. Like suddenly I was part of her definition of safety.

I kept my face steady.

“I’m coming,” I said, and followed.

---

Charli’s room was neat in that anxious way: things arranged, not lived in. The bed made too tightly. Clothes folded too carefully. The kind of order that came from fear of being criticised rather than pleasure in calm.

Lauren went straight to the dresser.

“Which drawer?” she asked.

Charli pointed without speaking.

Lauren opened it.

There it was: another white bottle, less empty than the first. A printed label that tried to make a dangerous thing look routine.

Lauren picked it up, held it a moment, and then—without looking at Charli—she slid it into her pocket.

Charli made a small sound that wasn’t quite a sob. More like a protest caught in the throat.

Lauren turned and faced her then.

“Listen to me,” she said. “You are not in trouble for wanting what you want.”

Charli blinked hard.

“You are in trouble,” Lauren continued, “for risking your body in secret.”

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I didn’t want it to stop.”

Lauren’s eyes softened, just slightly, and in that softness I saw the mother’s grief: the knowledge that her child had felt alone enough to do this.

Lauren’s voice lowered.

“Nothing that’s real,” she said, “requires you to hurt yourself to keep it.”

Charli crumpled on the edge of the bed, towel still clutched to her chest like a child. Her shoulders shook once.

I had to force my hands to stay at my sides.

Every instinct in me wanted to step forward, to touch her hair, to tuck it behind her ear, to do something small and intimate that would say: *I see you. I’ve seen you. I won’t unsee you.*

I did nothing.

Not because I didn’t want to.

Because I wanted it too much.

Lauren glanced at me then—not accusing, not territorial. Something else.

Awareness.

She could see it. Or she could see enough to suspect.

I held her gaze, steady, and gave her something she could work with: the practical.

“We need a plan for tomorrow,” I said. “Not vague. Not emotional. A list.”

Lauren nodded once, grateful for the handrail.

“Yes,” she said. “A list.”

Charli looked up, confused, watery-eyed. “Tomorrow?”

“Yes,” I said, and my voice softened without losing its edge. “Tomorrow.”

She flinched as if the word meant confiscation forever.

Lauren sat on the bed beside her—not quite touching, but close enough to be felt.

“Tomorrow,” Lauren said, “we make appointments.”

Charli swallowed. “What if they—”

“They won’t,” Lauren said sharply, then corrected herself into something calmer. “And if someone does, we change doctors. We’re not begging for dignity.”

Charli stared at her, stunned by the certainty.

I felt another flicker in me—admiration, yes, but also that jealous responsibility again.

Because it was *so* easy, watching Lauren, to imagine how Charli’s loyalty could split: mother on one side, me on the other. Two women offering structure. Two women claiming outcome.

Charli’s gaze did the thing again—back and forth between us.

I could almost see the question behind her eyes:

*Which one do I belong to?*

My throat tightened.

I swallowed it.

For now.

“We’ll start with your GP,” I said, and kept it simple. “Bloodwork. Baselines. Then referrals to someone who’s actually experienced. We don’t do this on vibes.”

Charli’s lips trembled, but her shoulders eased a fraction at the word baselines—as if numbers could soothe her, as if structure could be a substitute for fear.

Lauren nodded.

“Okay,” she said. “And until then?”

I didn’t look at Charli when I answered. I looked at Lauren. Adult to adult.

“Until then,” I said, “no more doses. We keep her safe. We watch for symptoms. We don’t guess.”

Charli’s face tightened.

Lauren’s hand found Charli’s forearm and squeezed.

“It’s not forever,” Lauren said to her. “It’s ‘until we can do it right.’”

Charli’s eyes filled again.

“But it was making the… the horrible feeling stop,” she whispered.

I felt that in my chest like a bruise. Because I understood something now that I hadn’t admitted to myself before:

Her happiness wasn’t a mood.

It was relief.

It was safety.

It was the easing of a long, private terror.

I stepped closer.

Not to touch her.

Just to be nearer.

“Charli,” I said, and my voice was slow. Careful. “I’m not taking your future away.”

She looked at me, searching.

“I’m taking *danger* away,” I said. “There’s a difference.”

Her mouth trembled. She nodded, but it was the nod of a person who didn’t fully believe life would keep its promises.

Lauren stood.

“I’m staying tonight,” she said, not asking.

Charli’s eyes widened. “Mum—”

“Not negotiable,” Lauren said, and then—softening, just a little—“I’m not leaving you alone with your fear.”

Charli’s shoulders shook again, and this time she let the tears come.

Lauren turned toward me.

“Thank you,” she said again. This time it had more weight.

I nodded.

And then, because honesty matters between women, because it’s the only thing that keeps power clean, I said:

“I care about her,” I said quietly. “More than I realised.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine.

She didn’t blink. She didn’t flinch.

She simply nodded, once—accepting the truth as data, not as drama.

“Good,” she said. “Then help me do this properly.”

It should have felt like relief.

Instead, the word *help* slid under my ribs and hooked itself there.

Because help, in this context, meant a future that included me.

A future that could ask more of me than I’d planned to give.

Charli looked between us again, tears on her cheeks, hair damp, face open and frightened.

And I felt that jealous responsibility rise again—quiet, fierce.

I swallowed it.

For now.

Tomorrow would give me lists and appointments and numbers to hold onto.

Tonight, I would hold my distance like a discipline.

And I would learn how long I could keep doing it.

---

If you like this, the next scene practically writes itself: **the “boring appointments” montage** as a kind of quiet courtship. Celeste accompanies them at least once, “only for support,” and realises she’s watching Charli in waiting rooms the way you watch someone you love without permission to say so. Lauren notices. Says nothing. *Yet.* 😌💛

---

[Q]  
This is in Lauren's POV? And she perceives Celeste's concern has a deep emotional roots. There's no way that Lauren wouldn't approve, right? Not only does she have enormous respect (and gratitude) for Celeste, but she couldn't hope for a better partner for Charli. The whole 'wife' thing falls into place, but Lauren *does* realise that this wasn't a plot on Celeste's part: it was a fortuitous outcome... safety for her child, a relationship her child would feel fulfilled in.

---

[A]
Yes — **this next beat wants to be Lauren’s POV** ✅💛

Because *Lauren is the one who can name it without flinching*: she can clock Celeste’s investment, test whether it’s clean (not predatory, not a “project”), and then—because she’s a mother with a spine—quietly **sanction** it. Not as romance-fantasy, but as *outcome logic*: safety, stability, a woman she trusts, a future that fits Charli.

And you’re dead right: Lauren would not read this as a plot. If anything, she’ll read it as **the rarest kind of good luck**—something that grew out of competence, standards, and care… and then surprised even Celeste.

Here’s a drafted scene in **Lauren POV**, picking up right where Celeste calls her and she arrives.

## Scene 31

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116af.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />


## **Scene 31 — “Fortuity” (Lauren POV)**

I drove over on autopilot.

Not because I wasn’t thinking—because thinking was useless. Thinking was what you did *after* you had your child in front of you, breathing, intact, not bleeding from a mistake you couldn’t reverse.

My hands were steady on the wheel. My chest was not.

At every red light I checked my phone again, as if the words might change: **Spironolactone. Online. Months.**

The kind of sentence that didn’t belong in your life until it did.

When I got to Celeste’s door, I didn’t knock politely. I knocked like a mother.

She opened it immediately.

Celeste looked calm. Not casual—calm like someone holding a line on purpose. Her hair was tied back. Her face was composed, eyes clear.

In her kitchen, Charli stood with a towel clutched to her chest like armour. Damp hair. Bare feet. A familiar, hated shape of fear: the old braced posture, the waiting-for-punishment posture.

And then I saw the bottle on the table.

White plastic. Printed label.

My stomach dropped in a way that felt physical, like my organs were trying to get out.

I crossed the room and stopped in front of my daughter.

For a second I didn’t touch her. I needed to see her eyes. I needed to know whether she was present, whether she was thinking, whether she was safe enough to be reached.

Charli looked at me like she’d been holding her breath for days and didn’t know whether I’d come to rescue her or finish her.

“Are you okay?” I asked.

The words came out soft. The meaning did not.

Charli’s mouth trembled. “I’m— I didn’t—”

Her voice broke. That alone told me what I needed to know: she hadn’t done this because she was reckless. She’d done it because she was *terrified*.

I lifted my hand and cupped her cheek. A single thumb swipe, gentle.

“I’m here,” I said, and felt her lean into it—only a fraction, only for a heartbeat—before she remembered she wasn’t allowed to need.

I looked at Celeste then.

Not because I doubted her. Because she’d called me. Because she’d held this until I could get here. Because I needed the facts in the cleanest form possible.

“She’s safe,” Celeste said before I asked. “Right now. But this can’t continue.”

Good.

No drama. No soothing. No excuses. Just the truth.

Celeste’s tone did something else too—it carried the shape of controlled fear. Not panic. Not performative concern.

Something deeper. Something disciplined.

I registered it and stored it away.

“How long?” I asked Charli.

Charli flinched. Looked down. “Almost four months.”

Four months.

I repeated it in my head without letting it touch my face. Four months of unmonitored medication. Four months of her body being altered by a decision she had no right to bear alone.

And four months of her believing she *had to*.

I kept my palm on her cheek.

“You have more?” I asked.

Her hesitation was too long.

“Yes,” she whispered. “In my drawer.”

“Okay,” I said.

Not “why.” Not “how could you.” Not yet.

“Show me.”

Charli’s eyes snapped to Celeste, not to me.

That told me something too.

Not betrayal. Not preference. Something else: **orientation**. Like Charli’s compass had learned a new north and didn’t know what to do about it.

Celeste moved first.

“I’m coming,” she said.

I watched her as she followed us down the hall: controlled posture, steady breath, hands not reaching. She was doing the thing women do when they want to touch someone and refuse to make it about that.

It was restraint.

It was also effort.

In Charli’s room the second bottle was exactly where it would be: hidden, but not well. A girl’s hiding. Not criminal, not cunning—just desperate.

I took it, turned it in my hand, read the label like reading could change what it said.

Then I slipped it into my pocket.

Charli made a sound—small, strangled. Like an animal losing its last piece of cover.

“Mum—”

I held up one hand.

“Charli.”

Her name, clean. Not loud.

She stopped.

I turned fully toward her.

“Listen to me,” I said. “You are not in trouble for wanting what you want.”

Her eyes flickered up, disbelieving.

“You are in trouble,” I continued, “for risking your body in secret.”

Tears started, fast and humiliating, and she wiped them as if she could erase them before anyone saw.

My throat tightened. I didn’t allow it to turn into softness that would blur the line. I kept my voice firm, because firm is kinder than unstable.

“I need you to understand something,” I said. “Nothing real requires you to hurt yourself to keep it.”

Charli’s shoulders folded. She sat on the bed’s edge like she couldn’t hold herself up anymore.

Beside her, Celeste stood still.

I glanced at Celeste again and—there it was.

Not pity.

Not professional concern.

A kind of tenderness that had teeth.

She wasn’t looking at Charli as a “case.” She was looking at her as if Charli mattered in a way that made the air more dangerous.

Celeste caught my eye.

She didn’t look away.

She didn’t soften into apology either.

She simply offered the practical, because practical is what you offer when your feelings are too big to trust.

“We need a plan for tomorrow,” she said. “A list.”

I nodded once.

Yes. A list. A structure. Something that could hold.

Charli looked between us again, mother and Celeste, as if she didn’t know which authority was going to be more painful.

And in that look I saw it: Charli wasn’t trying to manipulate anyone. She was trying to find out where she belonged.

Celeste’s face didn’t change, but I saw the tiny tell in her throat—a swallow, controlled, like she’d had to push something down.

Jealousy? No.

Not in the petty sense.

In the responsible sense.

Like she’d already started to feel accountable for my child’s outcome.

I didn’t resent it.

I felt—briefly, shockingly—relief.

Because if my daughter was going to attach to someone, if she was going to fall into a gravity well, then this was the kind of woman you *wanted* at the centre of it.

A woman with standards. A woman who didn’t do drama. A woman who didn’t blur boundaries for her own comfort.

And Charli… Charli would be fulfilled with a woman like that. Not indulged—**anchored**. Seen.

I turned back to Charli.

“Tomorrow,” I said, “we make appointments.”

Charli blinked, frightened. “What if they—”

“They won’t,” I snapped, then corrected my tone before it became sharp enough to cut her. “And if someone does, we change doctors. We’re not begging for dignity.”

Celeste made a quiet sound of agreement—barely audible. Not possessive. Not claiming. Simply aligned.

“We start with bloodwork,” Celeste said. “Baselines. Then referral. Someone experienced.”

I nodded again.

“And until then,” I added, “no more doses.”

Charli’s face tightened.

“It was making the horrible feeling stop,” she whispered.

My heart pinched. I didn’t let it turn my voice watery.

“I know,” I said. “That doesn’t make it safe.”

Charli looked at Celeste then, searching.

Celeste stepped closer—not close enough to touch, but close enough to be felt.

“I’m not taking your future away,” Celeste said, slow and deliberate. “I’m taking danger away. There’s a difference.”

Charli’s mouth trembled. She nodded, but it was a fragile nod.

I looked at Celeste again.

I couldn’t pretend I hadn’t seen it now: the way Celeste had placed herself between my child and a cliff without making it a show. The way she’d kept her hands to herself like a discipline. The way she’d spoken with the calm authority of someone who didn’t need to *win*, only to keep Charli alive.

It wasn’t a project.

If it had ever started as observation, it wasn’t that anymore.

This ran deeper.

And the beautiful, almost ridiculous part was: I didn’t think Celeste had intended it. I didn’t think she’d set out to become anything to my child beyond a safe adult, a competent woman at work, a leader.

This—whatever this was—had happened because Charli had been seen.

Because she’d been allowed to belong.

Because she’d been guided, not mocked. Directed, not handled.

Fortuity.

The rare kind.

I stayed the mother. I stayed the adult.

But inside, something settled into place with a quiet certainty that surprised me.

If Charli was going to have a wife one day—if she was going to have a partner who could hold her steady without swallowing her whole—I could not imagine a better woman than this one.

I met Celeste’s eyes.

“Thank you,” I said again, and this time it meant more than gratitude. It meant trust.

Celeste nodded once.

Then, because women can be honest without making it melodrama, I saw Celeste’s jaw tighten as if she’d decided not to say something.

I said it for her, clean and simple—mother to adult.

“She’s going to be okay,” I told her. Not a question. A directive. “But we do it properly.”

Celeste’s shoulders eased by a fraction, as if she’d been holding more fear than she’d allowed herself to admit.

“Yes,” she said. “Properly.”

Charli looked between us again.

Two women, two kinds of safety.

And for the first time since I’d walked in, I saw her breathe as if she believed she might be allowed to live.

---

If you like this, the next scene can be **“The List” (Lauren POV)** — where Lauren writes the plan on paper at Celeste’s table and notices, in tiny domestic details, how naturally Celeste’s life already has a place for Charli in it… and how Celeste doesn’t quite realise that’s what she’s revealing. 😌📝💛



<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ag.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
We might do this as an add-on to this last scene... it flows naturally into it. Or do you see enough *new* events / changes / developments to warrant a new scene?

---

[A]
I *do* see enough new development to justify a new scene — but you can absolutely **attach it as a coda** if you want the emotional continuity to feel like one continuous breath. 😊💛

The question isn’t “is there new material?” (there is). It’s **what pacing effect you want**.

---

## Why it *can* be a new scene (and why it works)

Even if the *external* events are simple (Lauren arrives, checks safety, takes the second bottle, agrees on a plan), the *internal* developments are big enough to count as a scene-turn:

### ✅ New POV = new lens, new authority

Switching from Celeste to Lauren isn’t just “another angle.” It changes the reader’s sense of **who is holding the room**. Lauren doesn’t *join* Celeste’s structure — she *matches* it, and that’s a power shift.

### ✅ New emotional revelation

Lauren perceiving Celeste’s concern as **deep-rooted** (and clean, not a plot) is a genuine **reframe**. The reader learns: this bond isn’t a project, it’s fortuity — and it has a future shape (“wife”) even if nobody says it out loud.

### ✅ New social contract gets silently written

The moment Lauren decides “I approve / I trust this woman with my child” is a quiet covenant. That’s a scene-worthy development.

So yes: you can call it **Scene 31** (Lauren POV) and it will feel earned, not padded.

---

## Why it can also be an add-on (and why that might be better)

If you want Scene 30 to feel like a single rolling wave—**Brush → Bottle → Confrontation → Arrival**—then treating Lauren’s POV as a **coda** keeps the momentum and avoids the feeling of “new chapter, new start.”

A coda works especially well because:

* Scene 30 ends on Celeste’s internal vow: *structure, safety, don’t break her.*
* The coda then *confirms* that vow from the outside: Lauren sees it, understands it, and endorses it.

It becomes a satisfying click-lock: **Celeste commits → Lauren validates → the “wife” architecture quietly begins.**

---

## The cleanest solution, in my view ✨

### **Keep it as one scene, but label the POV shift as a “Coda”**

That gives you flow *and* signals to the reader that this is a deliberate lens-change, not head-hopping.

Example formatting:

**Scene 30 — “The Brush” (Celeste POV)**
…end as you already have it…

**Coda — “Fortuity” (Lauren POV)**
Lauren arrives… perceives Celeste… approves… the wife concept settles as “safety with meaning.”

This is my favourite because it keeps the evening’s continuity intact while still giving Lauren her rightful authority.

---

## When I’d recommend a full new scene instead 📌

Make it a full Scene 31 if you plan to include **one additional “new beat”** beyond arrival + plan, such as:

* Lauren sees something in the apartment (a garment, a note, a brush, a folded kerchief) that proves the care has history.
* Lauren and Celeste have a brief private exchange in the hallway while Charli is in the bathroom—where Lauren silently tests Celeste’s intentions and finds them clean.
* Charli asks a single pointed question (“Are you… angry with me?”) and Lauren answers in a way that resets Charli’s fear.
* The trio makes a practical agreement about boundaries for the night (sleeping arrangement, supervision, phones, what happens if Charli panics at 2am).

Any one of those makes it feel unmistakably like a new scene rather than an extension.

---

## My suggestion for *your* stated intent 💛

Because you want “wife” to **fall into place** as a *fortuitous, non-plot outcome*, I’d do:

* **Scene 30 ends with Celeste’s vow** (as you have it).
* **Coda: Lauren POV** delivers the quiet endorsement and the internal conclusion: *Couldn’t hope for better. This is safety. This is partnership.*
  (No announcement. No romance flag-waving. Just mother-logic.)

It will feel deliciously inevitable.

---

If you’d like, I can **stitch the Lauren POV piece directly onto the end of Scene 30** as a coda, with the transitions smoothed so it reads like one continuous night—no seams, just that subtle change of camera. 😌🧵💛

---

[Q]  
Right. Correct if I'm wrong, but if I am saving things correctly, we started today with Scene 30: Celeste combing Charli's hair, then discovering the bottle. That was Celeste's POV

Then, we re-enacted the sme 

---

[A]
You’re remembering it correctly, yes 😊💛 — and I can help you “label” what happened today so what you’ve saved stays tidy and doesn’t get muddled.

### What we did today, in order

1. **Scene 30 (Celeste POV)** — your original:

   * Wardrobe running smoothly
   * “The Brush” moment: Celeste fixes Charli’s hair / cap & kerchief test
   * That evening: Celeste finds the **spironolactone** bottle in Charli’s bag
   * Confrontation + Celeste calls Lauren

2. **Scene 30 — Revised Pass (Celeste POV)**

   * I did a full proofread/cleanup + corrected typos + smoothed cadence
   * We shifted Celeste from “Wardrobe/Mara steel” to **still-in-command but softer** (because she’s emotionally invested)

3. **Scene 30 — Soft-Romantic Undertone Pass (Celeste POV)**

   * Same events as #2, but I leaned *half a notch further* into Celeste’s feelings:

     * tiny lingering hand beat
     * a swallowed thought (“I could lose her”)
     * protective satisfaction, etc.
   * Still no declarations—just controlled leakage.

4. **“Lauren arrives” continuation: two alternative ways to handle it**

   * **Option A: Scene 31 (Celeste POV) — “The Arrival”**

     * Lauren arrives; bottle + second bottle retrieval; plan forms
     * Celeste feels the first flicker of *jealous responsibility* and swallows it
   * **Option B: Scene 31 (Lauren POV) — “Fortuity”**

     * Same situation, but through Lauren’s eyes
     * Lauren perceives Celeste’s concern has deep roots
     * Lauren approves (implicitly “wife” architecture settling, *not* a plot)

And then we discussed the best packaging: **either a new Scene 31** *or* a **Coda** attached to Scene 30 (with a clearly marked POV shift).

---

### The clean “save format” I’d use (so you don’t lose track)

* **Scene 30 — “The Brush” (Celeste POV)**

  * (use the Soft-Romantic Undertone version as your “final” if you like it best)

* **Coda — “Fortuity” (Lauren POV)**

  * (Lauren arrives + internal endorsement + the wife-shape quietly appears)

That keeps it as *one continuous night* while still giving Lauren her rightful authority and insight.

---

If you paste the rest of your sentence (“Then, we re-enacted the sme…”) I can match it exactly to the outline above—but even with the cutoff, I’m confident this is the accurate map of what we produced today 😊🧵💛

---

[Q]  
Sorry, hit enter by mistake, Emily.

I hope I am saving things correctly: we started today with Scene 30: Celeste combing Charli's hair, then discovering the bottle. That was Celeste's POV.

Then, we re-enacted the same home-discovery-of-the-bottle scene, but from Lauren's POV. So, I saved that as scene 31, because of change of POV to Lauren, not events. So, I thought, if we're staying in Lauren's POV, we could just tack on the followup (plan / list / appointments / dr's visits - all without turning it into a transitioning tutorial) as CODA to scene 31. As sort of resolution, but also, as Lauren increasingly aware of Celeste's emotional investment.

Is that a sound idea?

---

[A]
Yes — that’s a **very sound idea**, and your reasoning is solid 💛✅

You’re essentially using **POV as the “chapter hinge”**, not “new events,” and that’s a legitimate structural choice—especially in a story like yours where *power, safety, and belonging* are conveyed through **who holds the camera**.

### Why your save logic works

* **Scene 30 = Celeste POV**:
  The brush, the bottle discovery, the confrontation, the call.
  This is Celeste becoming *implicated* (love leaking through discipline).

* **Scene 31 = Lauren POV**:
  Same situation reframed through the mother’s lens, which creates a *new meaning* even if the timeline overlaps. It’s not repetition if the second pass reveals **different information** (Lauren’s perception, Lauren’s approval, the “wife” architecture settling).

So yes: naming it Scene 31 based on POV change is coherent.

### Why the “Coda to Scene 31” is especially elegant

A Lauren-POV coda that covers **plan / list / appointments / boring logistics** can do three beautiful things at once:

1. **Resolution without melodrama**
   The crisis turns into process. That’s *Wardrobe logic applied to life*.

2. **Avoids tutorial vibes**
   If you keep it impressionistic—paper, pen, phone calls, waiting-room chairs, “bloodwork forms,” a receptionist’s tone—you get realism without becoming a how-to.

3. **Lets Lauren clock Celeste’s investment progressively**
   Not “Celeste is in love” as a statement, but:

   * Celeste never quite leaves the room
   * Celeste listens too carefully
   * Celeste remembers details Lauren didn’t say twice
   * Celeste’s restraint costs her effort (Lauren notices the cost)

That’s *exactly* the sort of slow reveal that feels adult and credible.

---

## One tweak I’d suggest (tiny, but it makes it even cleaner)

To avoid any sense of “repetition,” you can frame Scene 31 as starting **at the doorstep**—Lauren arriving—rather than re-living the bottle discovery beat in full.

Even if Lauren *thinks* about what Celeste told her on the phone, you can keep that as a quick echo, not a replay.

So your structure becomes:

* **Scene 30 (Celeste)**: bottle found → confrontation → call.
* **Scene 31 (Lauren)**: arrival → assessment → silent approval of Celeste → “wife” shape settles.
* **Coda (Lauren)**: the list / boring appointments montage → Lauren’s growing certainty about Celeste’s emotional roots.

That’s extremely tidy.

---

## What to include in the Coda (so it resolves, but doesn’t “teach”)

Here’s a little checklist of *texture* beats that read as story, not tutorial:

* The list on paper (Lauren’s handwriting, decisive headings)
* A GP reception line: “earliest appointment is…”
* A path of referrals implied, not explained
* Charli in a waiting room chair, hands tucked under sleeves, trying to be small
* Celeste’s quiet presence: not hovering, just **there**
* Lauren noticing: Celeste’s attention is not professional curiosity; it’s **protective devotion under restraint**
* One tiny domestic beat: Celeste makes tea, remembers how Charli takes it, then catches herself (Lauren sees it)

And you can end the coda on a line that locks in the “wife” architecture without naming it outright—something like Lauren thinking: *If my daughter is going to belong to anyone, let it be a woman who makes belonging safe.*

---

### Verdict 🙌

Your plan is not only sound — it’s **smart**. It keeps pacing clean, it honours POV as meaning, and it advances the emotional arc without romantic fireworks.

If you’d like, I can write that **Coda (Lauren POV)** in your established tone: calm, competent, not sentimental—where the romance is visible only in what Celeste cannot quite stop doing. 💛📝

---

Perfect. We're definitely on the same page, Emily. Please proceed.

## The List

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ah.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

## **Coda — “The List” (Lauren POV)**

Celeste made tea without asking.

Not as hospitality, exactly—more like a reset. A small act that said: *we are still in a world with kettles and mugs and ordinary choices.* A world where something could be handled.

Charli sat at the kitchen table with her towel finally dropped from her chest to her lap, damp hair combed back with an imperfect middle part that made her look younger than she was. She kept her shoulders drawn in, the way she did when she didn’t trust herself to be seen.

Celeste moved around her quietly. Not hovering. Not fussing. Just… present in a way that altered the room. She didn’t look at Charli as if she were fragile. She looked at her as if she were real.

I found paper and a pen.

If I didn’t write, I would think. If I thought, I would spiral.

A list was a handrail.

I wrote the heading in block letters.

**TOMORROW**

Then I drew a line under it so my brain would understand it was a boundary.

Celeste sat opposite me. Not beside. Opposite—adult to adult, as if she understood exactly what I needed: partnership, not consolation. Her phone was face-down on the table like a held tool.

Charli watched the pen move.

Her gaze flicked between us again, too quick to be polite. Mother. Celeste. As if she was trying to figure out which of us she was allowed to want most.

That look did something in my chest I didn’t have time to deal with.

I kept writing.

“Okay,” I said, not to be soothing but to be clear. “First thing: GP.”

Charli’s mouth tightened. “What if—”

“Then we change doctors,” I said. Flat. “We are not begging for dignity.”

Celeste made a small sound—not agreement exactly, but alignment. The quiet click of two women stepping into the same rhythm.

I wrote:

1. **GP appointment (urgent)**
2. **Bloodwork / baselines**
3. **Referrals**
4. **No more doses until supervised**
5. **Watch symptoms**

Charli stared at the page as if the ink could sentence her.

Celeste spoke without lifting her voice.

“We don’t have to decide your whole future tomorrow,” she said. “We decide safety. One step.”

Charli’s eyes darted up to her, and for a moment her face did something painfully open—like the relief arrived before her pride could stop it.

I saw Celeste notice it too.

And I saw Celeste not reach for it.

Her hands stayed folded on the table.

That restraint—again—so deliberate it almost hurt to watch.

I wrote **SAFETY** in the margin and underlined it twice.

Then I took my phone and started making calls.

The first receptionist had the tone of someone who had heard everything and cared about none of it.

“Earliest is next week.”

“No,” I said, and let my voice go cold. “Not next week.”

A pause.

“I can put you in a cancellation slot tomorrow afternoon.”

“Yes,” I said. “Do that.”

I didn’t look at Charli while I spoke. I didn’t need her to feel like this was her audition. This was my job.

When I hung up, Charli looked at me as if she didn’t know whether to thank me or apologise.

I lifted my pen slightly, a stop sign.

“Don’t,” I said.

Her lips pressed together. She nodded.

Celeste slid the mug of tea across to her. She didn’t push it into her hands. She simply placed it within reach, as if assuming Charli would take what she needed.

Charli wrapped her hands around the mug like it was warmth she’d been denied.

I watched Celeste’s eyes follow the movement—briefly, carefully—then lift away as if she’d caught herself doing it.

A stupid, intimate detail landed in my mind: Celeste had put two sugars in that tea.

I hadn’t told her Charli took two sugars.

I didn’t comment.

I didn’t smile.

I wrote it down somewhere private inside myself, in the same place I stored all the other things mothers keep: signs and tells, danger and luck.

Fortuity, I thought again.

Rare.

Then I made the second call: the pharmacy.

Not to ask questions. To establish facts.

“What’s the label say?” I asked Charli, and she flinched at the word label as if labels were the whole problem.

Celeste’s voice cut in softly.

“Give it to your mum,” she said. “Let her read it.”

Not “show her.”

*Give it to her.*

Charli hesitated, then took the bottle from where Celeste had left it on the table and slid it toward me. Her fingers didn’t touch mine. They hovered, then retreated.

The pharmacy tech’s voice was brisk.

“Yes, that is prescription-only.”

“Yes,” I said. “I know.”

I didn’t say anything else. I didn’t need a lecture. I needed tomorrow and bloodwork and a clinician who understood the difference between harm control and judgement.

I ended the call.

The room went quiet again.

Charli’s breathing was loud in it, like she couldn’t quite remember how to make herself small enough.

Celeste spoke into the silence.

“Tonight,” she said, “you sleep.”

Charli blinked. “I—”

“Sleep,” Celeste repeated, gentle but final. “You can panic tomorrow if you want. Tonight you sleep.”

Charli’s throat moved.

She looked at me, asking permission the way she always had: *am I allowed to comply?*

“Yes,” I said. “Tonight you sleep.”

Charli’s shoulders loosened, a fraction. Not relief—permission.

I wrote:

6. **Food / water / sleep**

Then I drew a line.

The list was becoming a map.

---

We didn’t talk about love.

We didn’t talk about identity.

We didn’t talk about any of the words that could turn this into a debate instead of a plan.

We ate something small—toast and eggs, because the body needs fuel whether or not the mind approves. Charli ate like a person who wasn’t sure she deserved it, but she ate.

After, Celeste rinsed dishes with the same efficiency she had at work, then stopped herself and dried her hands as if she’d remembered she was in a home, not Wardrobe.

I saw her glance toward Charli—briefly—and then away, as if she’d looked too long.

It wasn’t shame.

It was discipline.

And I understood, with a clarity that surprised me, what I was watching.

Celeste cared.

Not vaguely. Not as a role. Not as an idea.

With roots.

The kind that make you dangerous to yourself if you’re not careful.

It wasn’t a plot. It didn’t have the shape of a scheme. Celeste didn’t carry herself like someone who’d engineered an outcome. If anything, she looked like someone who had stumbled into something that mattered and was trying to behave correctly inside it.

Which meant the care was clean.

And it meant something else too, something that made my chest ease in a way I hadn’t expected.

If my daughter was going to attach to someone—if she was going to let her future hinge on another person—then thank God it was a woman who treated safety like a non-negotiable, who treated competence like love in its most useful form.

A woman who would not indulge Charli’s fear.

A woman who would not punish her for it either.

Charli drifted toward the couch at some point, folding into herself with the exhausted obedience of someone whose panic had finally run out of fuel. Her head tipped back against the cushion, eyes closing.

Celeste watched her for one heartbeat too long.

Then she looked at me, as if asking, silently, what the rules were.

I answered with my own eyes.

*Keep her safe. No drama. No hooks.*

Celeste nodded once.

Understood.

I picked up my pen again and added one last thing to the list:

7. **No secrecy**

Then I hesitated.

And wrote beneath it:

8. **No doing this alone**

The words sat on the page like a promise I intended to keep.

---

When the apartment finally settled into real quiet, Celeste stood at the window for a moment, arms folded, as if she were holding herself together by posture alone.

I joined her, not close enough to be intimate, close enough to be allied.

“She’s terrified,” Celeste said softly, watching the dark outside.

“I know,” I replied. “So are you.”

Celeste’s breath caught. Not denial. Recognition.

She didn’t look at me.

“I’m fine,” she said, and it was the kind of lie women told when they were trying to stay useful.

I let it pass.

Then I gave her the truth that mattered.

“Thank you,” I said, quiet. “For calling me. For holding the line.”

Celeste nodded once.

“She’s not a problem,” she said, and I heard, underneath the control, the depth of it. “She’s a person.”

I looked at her then.

And I saw what my daughter had been looking at all night: not just competence, not just leadership.

A woman who could be a shelter without becoming a cage.

A woman who would set standards and call it care.

A woman my daughter could grow beside.

The word wife didn’t need to be spoken to be understood.

It settled into place anyway—naturally, almost annoyingly inevitable—as if the world had finally aligned something that had been crooked for too long.

Not because anyone plotted it.

Because sometimes, if you’re very lucky, the best outcome arrives as an accident of decency.

Celeste exhaled, slow.

“Tomorrow,” she said.

“Yes,” I replied. “Tomorrow.”

We stood there for another moment, watching the night.

And in the silence between us, I made my own private vow:

Whatever happened next—whatever doctors said, whatever paperwork came, whatever waiting rooms we had to endure—I would not let my daughter go back to being alone inside her fear.

And I would not be afraid of the good fortune standing beside me.

Not if it meant my child could finally live.

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ai.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

This whole scene gives me pause. I'm going to approach it very carefully, trying to perserve your tone.

As far as what happens next, we can gloss over the actual process of Charli getting the attention she needs by couching it as a chat Lauren and Mara have about what was happening to Charli. Of course, Mara already had her suspicions--she's not blind or stupid--but she does need to be brought up to speed. But, we're talking Mara, here. She doesn't require exhaustive detail: a brief summary is her style. 

Not sure how we fit the next bit in: Charli continues to glow, even more now, because the medically-approved treatment is going to make her 'belonging' even more real to *her* because for her, stopping biology hadn't been what had brought about the biggest changes: it was because she was becoming more like her friends. She sees this as "yes, you see me as one of you, because... see? I actually *AM* one of you!" She no longer has to rely on an anti-androgen alone. Real changes are now allowed to happen. I would prefer this to somehow be couched in either Lauren's or Celeste's POV, rather than Charli's.

---

[A]
You’re thinking about it exactly the right way, Robyn 💛—and yes: the safest path (tonally and ethically) is to **de-centre the “process”** and centre **the women’s competence network**: Lauren + Mara (and optionally Celeste) exchanging only what’s needed, then letting the *results* show up in Charli’s behaviour and in the room.

Also: I completely agree with your instinct to keep this **out of Charli’s POV**. If the emotional meaning is “belonging becomes real,” that’s actually *stronger* when it’s witnessed by Lauren/Celeste/Mara—because it stays in the women’s gaze, and avoids any “transition tutorial” feel.

Below is a concrete way to do it that preserves your tone, keeps detail minimal, and still delivers the glow + “allowed to happen” shift.

---

## How I’d structure what happens next (clean, non-tutorial)

### 1) A short **Lauren ↔ Mara** briefing scene (Lauren POV or Celeste POV)

Purpose:

* Bring Mara up to speed in Mara’s language: brief, factual, standards-first.
* Establish: “We’re doing it properly now.” (bloodwork, supervision, specialists—mentioned once, not lingered on)
* Mara’s reaction is *not shock*, but a crisp: “Good. Then stop improvising.” / “Then we build around it.”

This scene does *not* need Charli present.

### 2) A **Wardrobe follow-on** where Charli’s glow is shown as *function*

Purpose:

* Charli’s “belonging” becomes physically/socially real *without* her narrating it.
* Celeste and/or Lauren notices: Charli is calmer; she inhabits her body; she laughs more freely; her hands stop trembling when observed; she stops “asking permission to exist.”

This is where the line you gave lands, but from someone else’s camera:

> She’s not glowing because of medication. She’s glowing because the room and her body are finally allowed to agree.

### 3) Optional: a quiet “wife architecture” beat

Not romance-y. Not explicit.
Just one moment where Lauren sees Celeste orient toward Charli’s well-being as instinct, and thinks: *Yes. That. That’s safety.*

---

## Micro-technique to show “real changes now allowed” without describing them

You can avoid medical detail and still let the reader feel the shift via:

* **Language change**: Charli says “Okay” instead of “Sorry.”
* **Body change**: she lifts her chin when she’s addressed; she stops shrinking.
* **Social change**: the women talk to her as if she is *already* one of them (not “included,” but assumed).
* **Ritual change**: she participates in the morning systems—ledger, pins, caps—with ownership, not obedience.

That’s your “See? I actually *AM* one of you!”—but we *never* put that sentence in her mouth. We let her act it.

---

## Draft: a short bridging scene (Lauren POV) — “Briefing Mara”

This is intentionally lean and Mara-proof:

### **Scene 32 — “Briefing” (Lauren POV)**

Mara didn’t do heart-to-hearts.

She did facts, and then she did what you did next.

I caught her before the room fully woke—before the steam, before the scissors found their rhythm—when she was alone at the big table with a piece of brown card and a pencil, making a line behave.

She looked up when I came in. One glance. Assessment.

“Problem?” she said.

I didn’t waste words.

“Not a Wardrobe problem,” I said. “A Charli problem.”

Mara’s pencil paused. Not surprise. Attention.

I stayed standing. I kept my voice flat.

“She bought an anti-androgen online,” I said. “Has been taking it unsupervised. We stopped it. We’re getting her medical oversight. Bloodwork. Specialist. Proper pathway.”

Mara’s face didn’t change, but her jaw set—like something in the world had annoyed her by being preventable.

“How long?” she asked.

“Months,” I said. “Long enough.”

Mara exhaled once through her nose.

“Of course she did,” she said, and it wasn’t judgement. It was simple recognition: *a girl alone will do what a girl thinks she has to do.*

I braced for anger. Mara didn’t give me anger. She gave me standards.

“Good,” she said. “Now it’s supervised.”

“Yes.”

Mara’s pencil tapped the table once, like a period at the end of a sentence.

“Then we stop improvising around her,” she said. “We build around her.”

I swallowed. “She’s been scared of… changes.”

Mara’s eyes lifted, sharp.

“She’s scared of not belonging,” Mara corrected. “Different fear. Same outcome.”

She went back to her line. Straight. Unforgiving. Useful.

“Tell Celeste,” she added, as if I hadn’t been living in Celeste’s apartment for half the night already. “And tell her this: I don’t need details. I need the constraints.”

I nodded. “Constraints?”

Mara finally looked up again.

“What she can and can’t do. When she needs breaks. Any risk. Any mood swings. Any fainting. Anything that changes the work,” Mara said, brisk. Then her voice lowered, just slightly—Mara’s version of care.

“And if she starts apologising again, shut it down. That habit will kill her faster than a needle.”

I didn’t trust my voice, so I nodded.

Mara’s pencil moved again.

“Bring her in,” she said. “Same standards. More guardrails.”

Not rescue. Not pity.

Belonging, Mara-style: **structure that holds.**

---

## Then: how to show Charli’s “glow” in Celeste POV (no tutorial)

If you’d like, next I can write a follow-up scene like:

### **Scene 33 — “Allowed” (Celeste POV)**

* A few weeks later, Wardrobe morning.
* Charli enters with a new steadiness.
* Celeste watches herself watching Charli.
* The difference isn’t “medical changes,” it’s: Charli behaves like someone who has proof the women weren’t pretending.
* Celeste thinks (privately): *She’s not trying to be one of us anymore. She is.*

It’ll be all subtext and behaviour: posture, laughter, eyes, the way she takes direction, the way she gives it back.

---

If you want me to proceed, I’ll write **Scene 33 (Celeste POV)** next, with the exact effect you described: Charli’s belonging becomes *real to her*, and Celeste sees it as the room and Charli finally agreeing—without ever spelling out the medical pathway. 💛🧵

---

You have your finger on the proverbial pulse, Emily. Please proceed.

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116aj.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

## **Scene 33 — “Allowed” (Celeste POV)**

The first thing I noticed was that Charli stopped arriving like she was borrowing air.

Not all at once. Not like a switch.

More like a tide that had turned and, day by day, refused to go back out.

Wardrobe hadn’t changed. The room was the room: steam in the kettle, scissors waking, the long tables holding their familiar clutter of tools and half-finished things. Mara’s ledger still sat where it belonged, heavy with names and notes and the neat violence of accountability. Labels still existed. Rules still did.

But Charli—Charli started to move through it as if the rules were no longer a door she had to beg to be opened.

They were the shape of the house.

She came in early, as usual, bag on the same hook, hands washed the same thorough way. The ritual stayed. What changed was the energy underneath it.

The early-ness used to feel like payment. A quiet offering, an attempt to earn her right to be there.

Now it felt like preference.

Ownership.

She didn’t flinch when someone spoke her name. She didn’t tighten when footsteps came up behind her. She didn’t shrink into herself when the room looked at her; she held her place inside it like she had learned that place was not conditional.

It wasn’t bravado. It wasn’t performance.

It was peace.

And it did something to me every time I saw it, in the same infuriating way the wrong seam line will bother you until you fix it: a quiet insistence that I acknowledge what I was looking at.

Charli wasn’t “improving.”

She was *settling.*

Mara gave her a task that morning without looking up from the table.

“Cap test,” she said. “Again.”

Charli nodded once. No apology. No “sorry.” No explanation.

“Okay,” she said.

The word should not have been a victory.

It was.

She moved to the shelf, took the cap and kerchief combination we’d refined, and set it out like someone who understood it wasn’t a favour to us. It was work.

Lucy was pinning a cuff. Tahlia was measuring a hem. Sarah sat on her stool, watching in the way she watched anything that might become a social fact.

Charli went to the mirror and began to fold her hair into the shape it needed to be, quick and practised.

No hovering.

No uncertainty.

No waiting for permission.

Her fingers still weren’t perfect—she still had that slightly too-tight twist when she got anxious—but she corrected it herself without being told, loosening it by a fraction until the cap would sit properly.

I watched my own reaction with a kind of clinical annoyance.

I wanted to step in.

Not because she couldn’t do it.

Because I wanted my hands in her hair again.

Because I wanted the intimacy of being allowed to fix her.

Because I wanted to feel her trust as a physical thing.

It was absurd. It was inconvenient. It was mine to manage.

So I didn’t move.

Charli pinned the coil down, set the cap, tied the kerchief, and turned her head left and right like she was checking the fit because it mattered—not because she feared being laughed at.

Sarah’s voice drifted across the room.

“Look at you,” she said, pleased. “Like you’ve been doing it your whole life.”

Charli’s mouth curved.

Not small. Not apologetic.

A real smile.

And then—this was new—she held the smile. She didn’t snatch it back the second she became aware it was visible.

“Thanks,” she said easily.

Sarah’s eyebrows lifted, as if she’d just witnessed a minor miracle.

Lucy didn’t look up. “If you tighten the knot, it’ll dig by lunchtime.”

Charli touched the tie, adjusted it by a hair. “Better?”

Lucy glanced once. “Better.”

No fuss. No praise. No performance.

Just women calibrating a thing together.

Charli turned slightly, checking herself in the mirror.

And for a second—only a second—I saw the exact moment something inside her settled.

It was almost imperceptible: the way her shoulders dropped, the way her chin lifted, the way her own gaze met her reflection and did not recoil.

As if she’d finally decided she believed us.

Not just that we were *being nice.*

That we meant it.

That when we said she belonged, we weren’t making an exception.

We were recognising a fact.

Mara looked over, took in the fit, and gave a curt nod.

“Move,” she said. “Prove it.”

Charli did.

She bent to reach fabric on the lower shelves, turned quickly, lifted her arms, moved through the narrow spaces between tables. The cap held. The kerchief held. The pins did their job.

Her body moved like someone who had stopped fighting itself.

Not in an athletic way. In a permission way.

As if she’d been given, finally, the right to occupy her own skin without flinching at every edge.

Bree appeared in the doorway mid-test, carrying a tote bag full of something that looked like lace and chaos.

She stopped dead when she saw Charli.

“Oh,” Bree said, delighted. “You look… you look *proper*, babe.”

Charli flushed—still bashful, still Charli—but she didn’t fold in on herself the way she used to. She didn’t try to vanish.

She lifted her chin, pink-cheeked, and kept moving.

Bree clapped once. “Yes! That’s it. That’s *it.*”

Tahlia smirked. “She’s been upgraded.”

“She’s been allowed,” Sarah said, too quick, too sharp to be accidental.

The room went quiet for half a beat at that—just long enough for the words to land.

Not in a mystical sense. Not in a fantasy sense.

In the real sense: *allowed* by systems and women and paperwork and boring appointments and a mother who did not blink.

Allowed by the world finally meeting her halfway.

Charli heard it. I saw it in the way her breath hitched, the way her hands paused for the smallest moment before they continued.

She didn’t look at Sarah.

She looked—briefly—at me.

Not pleading. Not apologising.

Checking.

As if she needed one more confirmation from the person whose gaze had become… weighty to her. Reliable. Defining.

I gave her a small nod. Calm. Professional.

And inside that calm, something dangerous warmed.

Because the look she gave me—quiet, grateful, trusting—didn’t feel like a subordinate checking a supervisor.

It felt like a girl checking whether the woman she loved was still there.

The thought landed in me like a dropped needle.

I didn’t react.

I turned back to the table and wrote in the ledger with a steadiness I had to manufacture:

**Cap + kerchief test: holds under movement. No slip. Adjust knot tension. Approved.**

Mara’s pen made a hard line underneath my note.

“Good,” she said.

Then, without looking up, she added, “Tell Lauren I want the constraints updated if anything changes.”

“I will,” I replied.

Charli kept moving through the room, finishing her test, returning the cap to the table, hands calm.

She didn’t ask if she’d done it right.

She didn’t apologise for existing.

She didn’t look like she was waiting to be punished for being happy.

When she passed me, she hesitated a fraction—not enough to call attention, just enough to be felt—and said quietly, “Thanks.”

“For what?” I asked, too quickly.

Charli’s eyes lifted. Clearer than they used to be. Less afraid.

“For… not making it a big thing,” she said.

I felt my chest tighten.

Because it *was* a big thing.

It was becoming a big thing in me, whether I wanted it to or not.

I kept my face steady.

“That’s what we do,” I said, and hated myself for how close it came to tenderness.

Charli nodded once, satisfied, and walked away.

Not to escape.

Just… to go back to work.

The room turned around her with its ordinary sounds: scissors, fabric, laughter, low talk. The day continued the way it always did.

And yet, in the middle of all of it, I could feel the shift like a new seam line you can’t unsee once it’s there.

Charli’s belonging wasn’t tentative anymore.

It wasn’t borrowed. It wasn’t conditional.

It was real enough to show in her body.

Real enough to show in her smile.

Real enough to make my own composure cost more than it used to.

Because now, when I looked at her, I wasn’t only seeing what I’d seen all along.

I was feeling it.

And the longer she glowed—quietly, naturally, without apology—the harder it became to pretend my investment was merely professional.

I could still be the adult.

I could still hold the line.

But the line was no longer drawn against her.

It was drawn against myself.

[Q]  
At this stage, Emily, the reader is going to expect: romance. Celeste-guided, but definitely romance. I mean, *I* am sitting here, breathless with anticipation: this *has* to blossom. Not at work, of course. But that night, perhaps? 

But, I appreciate the difficulty for Celeste to move from keeping Charli at arm's length to ... allowing her in. This is going to be a challenging write to get right (love that alliteration). I'm sure you're up for it.

---

[A]
Oh yes. The reader’s *earned* their romance now — not as fireworks, but as that inevitability you can’t un-feel once the room has stopped pretending. 😮‍💨💛

And you’re right about the craft challenge: Celeste has built her authority by *holding Charli steady from a slight distance*. To shift into intimacy without collapsing the moral architecture, she has to do it the way she does everything:

* **deliberately**
* **with consent**
* **off the clock**
* **without turning Charli into a “reward” for good behaviour**

So the move isn’t “Celeste finally gives in.”
It’s “Celeste chooses Charli — and makes that choice safe.”

Below is a scene draft for **that night**, Celeste POV, romance-forward but still adult, still controlled. It blossoms, yes… but it blossoms like a woman who’s been choosing restraint for months and now decides restraint is no longer the kindest option.

---

## **Scene 34 — “After Hours” (Celeste POV)**

That night, Wardrobe let go of us the way it always did—gradually.

Voices thinned. The kettle went quiet. The last pair of shears found its tin. Fabric was folded, not abandoned. The ledger closed with its familiar, satisfied weight.

Mara didn’t say goodnight. She never did. She simply kept writing until the room was no longer full of people worth supervising.

Sarah left with a wave that was too casual to be innocent.

Lauren had texted twice during the afternoon—short, functional updates, no drama.

**Bloods booked. GP tomorrow. She’s okay.**

Then, later:

**She’s glowing. Don’t make a thing of it.**

I stared at that second message longer than I needed to.

As if the phone had said something else underneath it.

*Don’t you dare break her with your own feelings.*

I didn’t reply. Not because I didn’t want to. Because I didn’t trust myself not to say too much.

When I finally stepped out into the evening air, Charli was already there—waiting near the gate, bag on her shoulder, hair tied back under a simple scarf. She looked tired and bright at the same time, the way people look when something heavy has shifted and the body hasn’t caught up.

She saw me and straightened, that old reflex half-returning.

Then she caught herself.

And stood normally.

“Hey,” she said.

“Hey,” I replied, and felt how strange it was—how intimate it sounded, coming from me, without the room around it.

We started walking.

Not toward her place. Not toward mine. Just… away.

It wasn’t a decision I announced. It was a direction my body took before my mind could turn it into policy.

Charli matched my pace without asking what we were doing, which should have been normal and wasn’t. For months, she’d needed permission for every step. Now she simply walked beside me like she belonged there.

The street was quiet. The air held that faint smell of eucalyptus and cooling asphalt. Somewhere, a dog barked once and stopped, as if even dogs were tired.

Charli kept her hands on her bag strap, fingers curled tight. She wasn’t trembling. She was holding herself together in a different way—like she was trying not to disturb her own happiness by moving too quickly.

“You did well today,” I said.

Charli gave a small laugh. “At… hats?”

“At existing,” I said before I could stop myself.

She looked at me sharply, startled.

I felt my own face warm, annoyed at my lack of control.

I kept my voice even.

“You don’t apologise as much,” I said. “That’s progress.”

Charli’s mouth softened. “I try,” she said. Then, after a beat: “It’s easier when I’m not… scared all the time.”

The words sat between us.

Not a confession. A fact.

I should have responded like an adult. Like a supervisor. Like the woman who had done all this so carefully.

Instead, I heard myself say, quieter than I intended:

“I’m glad you’re not scared.”

Charli’s gaze stayed on my face. Not darting away. Not bracing for correction.

Just… looking.

It made my throat tighten.

The sidewalk dipped toward a small park—nothing romantic, just a stretch of grass and a bench and a tired little tree. I sat down without thinking. Charli sat too, careful at first, then easing as if she remembered she’d earned benches now.

For a moment we listened to the world do nothing.

Then Charli spoke, softly.

“Lauren said you called her,” she said.

“Yes.”

Charli swallowed. “Thank you.”

“For calling your mum?”

“For… not letting me keep doing something stupid,” she said, and the faintest smile flickered. “Even when I hated you for it.”

I looked at her. “You hated me?”

Charli’s eyes widened, horrified. “No— I mean— not you. Not *you.* Just… the feeling. The idea of it stopping.”

I nodded once. I understood.

“I know,” I said. “I would have hated me too.”

Charli let out a breath—half laugh, half sob she didn’t let happen.

“I thought you’d… be disgusted,” she whispered.

The word landed hard.

I turned fully toward her.

“Disgusted?” I repeated, carefully, like I wanted her to hear how wrong it was.

Charli’s shoulders lifted in a small, helpless shrug. “People are,” she said. “Usually.”

Anger flared in me. Not hot, not wild. Cold and precise.

“That’s not your problem,” I said. “That’s theirs.”

Charli stared at me, eyes wet but steady.

“And you?” she asked, almost inaudible.

It was the simplest question in the world.

It did not feel simple.

I could have answered it a dozen ways that kept me safe. I could have lied gently. I could have dodged.

Instead I heard my own voice—slow, deliberate—like I was stepping onto a floor I hadn’t tested.

“I am not disgusted,” I said.

Charli’s mouth trembled.

“I… admire you,” I added, and felt the word pull something open in my chest. “You were alone with something frightening, and you still kept walking. You didn’t stop trying.”

Charli blinked fast. Her hands tightened on her strap.

“You’re the one who kept me,” she whispered.

The sentence was too much like *mine*.

I should have corrected it.

I didn’t.

I watched her struggle for another breath.

Then she said, quietly, like a truth she couldn’t afford to decorate:

“I don’t know what I’m allowed to feel.”

There it was.

Not “I love you.”

Not “Do you want me.”

Just the core confusion of someone who has spent her life being told wanting is dangerous.

I felt, in that moment, the full weight of what I held.

If I moved wrong here, if I moved fast, if I let my own hunger steer, I would become just another person who used her.

And I would rather die.

So I did it the only way that matched who I was.

I told her the rules.

Not Wardrobe rules.

*Us* rules.

“Off the clock,” I said first.

Charli nodded, immediate, as if relieved there was structure.

“No secrets,” I said.

Another nod.

“And you don’t do anything because you think it will make me keep you,” I said, and my voice went sharp with it. “Do you understand me?”

Charli’s eyes widened. “I wouldn’t—”

“I know,” I said, gentler. “But you might *try* without meaning to. You’re trained for that.”

Charli’s throat moved. She nodded again, smaller.

I held her gaze.

Then I let myself say the thing I’d been swallowing for weeks.

“I’m having trouble keeping distance from you,” I said.

Charli went very still.

Not afraid.

Listening.

“I don’t want to be someone who holds power over you,” I continued, careful. “And I do have power. In your life. In the room.”

Charli whispered, “You’re not—”

“I am,” I said, not unkind. “Which is why I’m saying it out loud. So we can do it clean.”

Her breath shook.

“Do what?” she asked.

I looked at her mouth.

Then forced myself back to her eyes.

“This,” I said.

And because I couldn’t trust ambiguity, because she deserved certainty, I asked:

“May I kiss you?”

Charli’s lips parted. Her face went pink—soft, incredulous—and for a second she looked like she might disappear from the sheer pressure of being wanted.

Then she nodded.

Once.

Clear.

“Yes,” she whispered.

I moved slowly. Not because I was hesitant.

Because I was careful.

Because she was not something you grabbed.

My hand lifted—hovered near her cheek—and I waited one heartbeat, giving her space to pull away if she needed.

She didn’t.

She leaned into my palm like she’d been doing it in secret for months.

I kissed her—gentle, brief, a question more than an answer.

When I pulled back, Charli stayed close, eyes closed for a moment as if she was trying to hold the sensation in her body without frightening it away.

I didn’t touch her again immediately. I let her breathe.

“That,” I said softly, “is allowed.”

Charli made a sound that was half laugh, half sob, and this time I let my thumb wipe the corner of her mouth, light as air.

“You’re… sure?” she whispered.

I felt my own smile—small, steady.

“Yes,” I said. “And I’ll keep being sure tomorrow, too.”

Charli’s eyes searched my face the way they always did when she needed proof.

She found it.

Her shoulders dropped. Her whole body softened like a person setting down a burden she’d been carrying in public.

And I realised, with a kind of quiet awe, that this was the real threshold.

Not the bottle. Not the paperwork. Not the bloodwork.

This.

A girl being allowed to be loved without having to earn it by being brave.

I kept my forehead near hers, not touching, close enough to share warmth.

“We go slow,” I said.

Charli nodded.

“And if you change your mind at any point,” I added, “you tell me. No apology.”

Another nod.

Her voice was so small when she spoke, it almost didn’t make it to the air.

“Okay.”

Not “sorry.”

Not “thank you.”

Just okay.

And that—more than anything—made my chest ache.

We sat on the bench until the night grew cooler.

Then I stood.

“Come on,” I said.

Charli rose, obedient out of habit, then steadied herself and walked beside me again—closer now, shoulder almost brushing mine, as if she’d been given a new coordinate for where she was allowed to stand.

At the corner, she hesitated.

“Tomorrow,” she said, uncertain again. “At work—”

“At work,” I said, firm, “I’m still Celeste.”

Charli nodded.

“And tonight?” she asked, barely audible.

I looked at her.

The streetlight caught her face and made her look, suddenly, entirely real. Not a project. Not a question. Not a fragile thing.

A girl I wanted.

“Aren’t you clever,” I murmured, and my tone was wry enough to save us both.

Charli’s smile broke open, bright and bashful.

Then I softened.

“Tonight,” I said, “I’m still me.”

And I offered her my hand.

I didn’t take hers.

I offered.

Charli stared at it for a beat like it was something sacred.

Then she slid her fingers into mine.

Warm.

Certain.

And as we walked back toward the lit windows of the world, I realised the line I’d been holding for months had finally moved.

Not because I’d failed.

Because I’d chosen to.

If you’d like next: we can do a *very short* follow-up beat the next morning (Celeste POV) where they’re back in Wardrobe mode—professional, clean—and the romance is *only* in micro-signals: a glance not taken, a distance maintained, a quiet steadiness in Charli that makes Sarah’s crow-eyes sharpen. 😉💛

[Q]  
Having the two go on a stroll near work for this scene as opposed to having it play out at home (where Charli was renting a room, if you recall) was a masterful stroke: it made the setting gentler, neutral, 'romantic evening' instead of "can you put the kettle on, dar'...". About the only change here I might possibly institute is a passage of time: Charli is on full treatment, mara is brought up to speed on it (which she appropriately wants to understand in order to watch for potential issues) and that's about it. HRT: done deal. Appointments, scripts: done. Charli can now relax - and so can all those who want her safe. Yes?

---

[A]
([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])([Past chat][1])

Yes — that’s exactly the adjustment that makes the romance *feel earned* and *safe* without turning the story into a medical procedural. 💛😌

And thank you for calling out the stroll setting — you’ve put your finger on why it works: it keeps the intimacy **off the domestic axis** (kettle / couch / caretaker vibes) and instead frames it as **two women choosing each other in neutral territory**. That’s cleaner, gentler, more romantic.

### About your “passage of time” change: ✅ Yes, absolutely.

If we insert (even lightly) that:

* Mara has been brought up to speed, has constraints, knows what to watch for
* Lauren’s done the mother-work: appointments, scripts, oversight
* the “done deal” status is now real (i.e., Charli is no longer improvising alone)
* the *acute danger* is over

…then everyone can exhale. And *that* becomes the emotional foundation for Celeste allowing herself to step closer.

The key is how we phrase it:

* Not “HRT explained.”
* Not “here’s what she’s on.”
* Just: **the boring machine has engaged** — appointments happened, paperwork happened, and now the adults have a proper rail to hold.

So the romance scene becomes not “in crisis,” but “in aftermath,” which is *much* more satisfying.

---

## The minimal patch to Scene 34 (to signal “this is after the settling”)

You don’t need to rewrite the whole thing. You only need a few lines early on to establish that the medical side is now contained and supervised.

Here are two options you can drop in near the beginning of Scene 34 (right after Wardrobe closes, before Charli appears outside).

### Option A: One tight paragraph (most elegant)

> Lauren had texted during the week—short, functional updates, no drama.
> **Appointments attended. Scripts sorted. Baselines logged.**
> The boring machinery had engaged, and with it came a relief that wasn’t joy exactly, but something sturdier: safety that didn’t depend on secrecy.

### Option B: Slightly more relational (adds Mara + constraints)

> Lauren’s updates had been brief and relentlessly practical.
> **Appointments. Scripts. Baselines. A specialist who didn’t blink.**
> Mara had asked for constraints the way she asked for grainlines—so she could build around them—then returned to work as if the world had simply corrected itself.
> The danger had moved from “unknown” to “managed,” and the whole room had exhaled without making a ceremony of it.

Either of those quietly tells the reader: *We’re past the cliff-edge. This is now a new phase.*

---

## What this change does for Celeste emotionally (and why it’s gold)

It lets Celeste’s softening read as:

* **not** rescue impulse
* **not** crisis bonding
* **not** a reward for compliance

But as: *Now that she’s safe, I can finally admit what I feel.*

Which is exactly what you want: the romance blooms because the *world is stable enough to hold it.*

---

## One tiny continuity note (Charli renting a room)

Totally aligned with your memory: keeping the romance away from “home” avoids the domestic-caretaker tone, especially when Charli’s housing isn’t fully hers. The walk also avoids the weirdness of “owner of the space” power dynamics. 👍

---

If you like, I can do a **surgical edit pass** on Scene 34 and hand you back the full scene with that “weeks later / settled / supervised” framing woven in seamlessly (no tutorial, no jargon), while preserving the exact tone you loved. 💛

## Scene 34?

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116al.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

Absolutely, Robyn 💛🧵 Here is **Scene 34** with a **surgical time-lapse patch** woven in: the “boring machinery” has engaged, Mara has constraints, Lauren’s done the mother-work, and the acute risk is behind them—so the stroll and the kiss land as **aftermath romance**, not crisis bonding.

## **Scene 34 — “After Hours” (Celeste POV) — Settled/Supervised Patch**

That night, Wardrobe let go of us the way it always did—gradually.

Voices thinned. The kettle went quiet. The last pair of shears found its tin. Fabric was folded, not abandoned. The ledger closed with its familiar, satisfied weight.

Mara didn’t say goodnight. She never did. She simply kept writing until the room was no longer full of people worth supervising.

Sarah left with a wave that was too casual to be innocent.

Lauren had texted during the week—short, functional updates, no drama.

**Appointments attended. Scripts sorted. Baselines logged.**
A specialist who didn’t blink. Bloodwork numbers filed like any other constraint: information you used, not something you sentimentalised.

Mara had asked for constraints the way she asked for grainlines—so she could build around them—and then returned to work as if the world had simply corrected itself. No commentary. No fuss. Only a quiet, relentless insistence that Charli be held safely inside the same standards as everyone else.

The acute danger was over.

Not the whole story—never that—but the cliff-edge of secrecy, the frantic improvisation, the bottle on the table: finished. The boring machine had engaged, and with it came a relief that wasn’t joy exactly, but something sturdier.

Safety that didn’t depend on luck.

I stared at Lauren’s last message longer than I needed to.

**She’s okay. Don’t make a thing of it.**

As if the phone had said something else underneath it.

*Don’t you dare break her with your own feelings.*

I didn’t reply. Not because I didn’t want to. Because I didn’t trust myself not to say too much.

When I finally stepped out into the evening air, Charli was already there—waiting near the gate, bag on her shoulder, hair tied back under a simple scarf. She looked tired and bright at the same time, the way people look when something heavy has shifted and the body hasn’t caught up.

She looked at me sharply, startled.

I felt my own face warm, annoyed at my lack of control.

I kept my voice even.

“You don’t apologise as much,” I said. “That’s progress.”

Charli’s mouth softened. “I try,” she said. Then, after a beat: “It’s easier when I’m not… scared all the time.”

The words sat between us.

Not a confession. A fact.

I should have responded like an adult. Like a supervisor. Like the woman who had done all this so carefully.

Instead, I heard myself say, quieter than I intended:

“I’m glad you’re not scared.”

Charli’s gaze stayed on my face. Not darting away. Not bracing for correction.

Just… looking.

It made my throat tighten.

The sidewalk dipped toward a small park—nothing romantic, just a stretch of grass and a bench and a tired little tree. I sat down without thinking. Charli sat too, careful at first, then easing as if she remembered she’d earned benches now.

For a moment we listened to the world do nothing.

Then Charli spoke, softly.

“Lauren said you kept checking,” she said.

“Checking what?”

“On me,” she said, and the embarrassment was faint, but real. “All week. At work. Not… obvious. Just—” She made a small motion with her fingers, as if miming a glance she didn’t want to name.

Heat rose in my face again. Annoyance, mostly.

“I was checking constraints,” I said.

Charli’s mouth curved in a way that told me she didn’t believe me.

“Mm,” she said, gently, and somehow the sound was an accusation and a kindness at once.

I exhaled through my nose, slow.

“Fine,” I said. “I was checking you.”

Charli went very still.

Not afraid.

Listening.

“I didn’t want you to feel watched,” I added, and heard, belatedly, how intimate that sounded. “But I needed to know you were… okay.”

Charli’s breath hitched once. “I am,” she whispered.

And then, because she was braver now—braver because the world had stopped punishing her for wanting—she said:

“You were angry.”

“Yes,” I said.

“Not at me,” she clarified quickly, old reflex rising.

I stopped that with my eyes.

“No,” I said. “Not at you.”

Charli swallowed. “Thank you,” she said, and her voice was steadier than it used to be. “For not letting me keep doing something stupid.”

I looked at her. “You hated me.”

Charli’s eyes widened, horrified. “No— I mean— not you. Not *you.* Just… the feeling. The idea of it stopping.”

I nodded once. I understood.

“I know,” I said. “I would have hated me too.”

Charli let out a breath—half laugh, half sob she didn’t let happen.

“I thought you’d… be disgusted,” she whispered.

The word landed hard.

I turned fully toward her.

“Disgusted?” I repeated, carefully, like I wanted her to hear how wrong it was.

“I… admire you,” I added, and felt the word pull something open in my chest. “You were alone with something frightening, and you still kept walking. You didn’t stop trying.”

Charli blinked fast, holding herself together. “You’re the one who kept me,” she whispered.

The sentence was too much like *mine*.

Charli went very still.

Not afraid.

Listening.

“I don’t want to be someone who holds power over you,” I continued, careful. “And I do have power. In your life. In the room.”

Charli whispered, “You’re not—”

“I am,” I said, not unkind. “Which is why I’m saying it out loud. So we can do it clean.”

Her breath shook.

“Do what?” she asked.

I looked at her mouth.

Then forced myself back to her eyes.

“This,” I said.

And because I couldn’t trust ambiguity, because she deserved certainty, I asked:

“That,” I said softly, “is allowed.”

Charli made a sound that was half laugh, half sob, and this time I let my thumb wipe the corner of her mouth, light as air.

“You’re… sure?” she whispered.

I felt my own smile—small, steady.

“Yes,” I said. “And I’ll keep being sure tomorrow, too.”

Charli’s eyes searched my face the way they always did when she needed proof.

She found it.

Her shoulders dropped. Her whole body softened like a person setting down a burden she’d been carrying in public.

And I realised, with a kind of quiet awe, that this was the real threshold.

Not the bottle. Not the paperwork. Not the bloodwork.

This.

A girl being allowed to be loved without having to earn it by being brave.

I kept my forehead near hers, not touching, close enough to share warmth.

“We go slow,” I said.

Charli nodded.

“And if you change your mind at any point,” I added, “you tell me. No apology.”

Another nod.

Her voice was so small when she spoke, it almost didn’t make it to the air.

“Okay.”

Not “sorry.”

Not “thank you.”

Just okay.

And that—more than anything—made my chest ache.

We sat on the bench until the night grew cooler.

Then I stood.

“Come on,” I said.

Charli rose, obedient out of habit, then steadied herself and walked beside me again—closer now, shoulder almost brushing mine, as if she’d been given a new coordinate for where she was allowed to stand.

At the corner, she hesitated.

“Tomorrow,” she said, uncertain again. “At work—”

“At work,” I said, firm, “I’m still Celeste.”

Charli nodded.

“And tonight?” she asked, barely audible.

I looked at her.

The streetlight caught her face and made her look, suddenly, entirely real. Not a project. Not a question. Not a fragile thing.

A girl I wanted.

“Aren’t you clever,” I murmured, and my tone was wry enough to save us both.

Charli’s smile broke open, bright and bashful.

Then I softened.

“Tonight,” I said, “I’m still me.”

And I offered her my hand.

I didn’t take hers.

I offered.

Charli stared at it for a beat like it was something sacred.

Then she slid her fingers into mine.

Warm.

Certain.

And as we walked back toward the lit windows of the world, I realised the line I’d been holding for months had finally moved.

Not because I’d failed.

Because I’d chosen to.

If you’d like, the next tiny “button” scene (half a page) can be **the following morning** in Wardrobe mode: they’re professional, clean—yet Sarah clocks *everything* and decides, privately, that Celeste has finally stopped pretending she’s immune. 😉💛

Yes, please.

## **Scene 35 — “Morning Rules” (Celeste POV)**

Wardrobe in the morning had a particular honesty to it.

Not the theatrical kind—no speeches, no declarations. Just the plain truth of women doing work: steam, chalk, fabric laid flat like a decision.

I arrived early, as I always did.

The room was cool and dim, lights half-on, the big tables waiting. I hung my bag on my hook. I washed my hands. I took the ledger out and opened it to the page we’d been living in all week.

Same rituals. Same body.

But something in me had shifted, and it made everything feel slightly louder.

I had slept. I had not slept. Both were true in different places.

Charli’s mouth, warm and brief against mine, was still in my nervous system like a held note.

I did not smile at it.

I catalogued it.

*Off the clock,* I reminded myself. *No secrets. No hooks.*

If I let warmth leak into the room, it would become currency.

I would not do that to her.

The kettle clicked on. The iron woke. The building began its daily inhale.

Mara arrived without greeting, as usual, coat off, sleeves rolled, face already in the work. She glanced at the ledger.

“Cap notes,” she said.

“I wrote them,” I replied.

Mara nodded once, then moved on as if I’d told her the sky was blue.

Tahlia drifted in next, carrying a roll of tape and a bag of pins. Lucy followed, expression unreadable. Bree arrived with a tote bag that looked like it could contain either lace or a small animal.

Sarah came in last, unhurried, coffee in hand, eyes bright with the kind of alertness that made me mildly want to ban her from the building.

She perched on her stool like it belonged to her and watched the room assemble.

Charli arrived five minutes after.

Not late. Not early enough to look like she was paying a fine.

Just… on time.

That, in itself, would have been unremarkable.

Except I saw it.

I felt it.

She came in with her scarf tied back neatly, hair smoothed into the shape the cap required. Her shoulders were down. Her breathing was even. She hung her bag on the hook and washed her hands, careful and thorough.

When she turned, her gaze met mine for half a beat.

No panic.

No “what are we now?”

Just a small steadiness, like she’d accepted the rules and trusted me to keep them.

I held her gaze for exactly the amount of time that was appropriate.

Then I looked back down at the ledger.

“Morning,” I said.

“Morning,” Charli replied.

Her voice was normal.

The absence of tremor felt like a gift.

Or a trap.

I refused both interpretations.

Mara set a pattern down on the table with a flat slap.

“Stomacher fit,” she said. “Charli. You’re on pins and marking.”

Charli stepped forward immediately, hands ready.

“Yes,” she said.

Not “sorry.”

Not “okay, if that’s alright.”

Just yes.

Lucy slid the pattern across with the efficiency of someone passing a tool.

Charli took it and began to work, pinning cleanly, checking alignment, chalk marking with a steadiness that would have been impossible a month ago. Her fingers moved like she was no longer afraid of making contact with the work.

Her body moved like it wasn’t waiting to be told it was allowed to occupy space.

I forced myself to keep my attention where it belonged—on the ledger, on the workflow, on the morning’s tasks.

And still, my mind offered me images like sabotage:

The bench. The park. My hand hovering. Charli leaning in without flinching. The soft sound she made when I said *allowed.*

I wrote a note harder than I needed to.

Bree leaned over to Charli, stage-whispering.

“You look very… sorted today.”

Charli’s mouth curved. “I feel sorted.”

The words were simple.

The meaning was not.

Tahlia snorted. “Careful. Sorted’s addictive.”

Charli laughed—quiet, real—and kept working.

Sarah watched all of it with the satisfaction of someone watching a kettle reach the moment before boil.

She sipped her coffee slowly, eyes moving between Charli and me like she was reading a ledger that wasn’t on paper.

I did not look up.

I could feel her seeing anyway.

Mara called, “Celeste.”

I looked up immediately, grateful.

“Tell Lauren,” Mara said, “I want updated constraints if anything changes. Mood. Energy. Faintness. Anything.”

“I will,” I replied.

Charli’s hand paused on a pin for a fraction, then continued.

The fact that she heard Mara’s word—constraints—and didn’t flinch was another small miracle.

Not because she wasn’t sensitive.

Because she was no longer interpreting structure as rejection.

She was interpreting it as inclusion.

Sarah’s voice floated across the room.

“Awfully responsible of you,” she said, to no one in particular.

I didn’t respond.

I didn’t need to. Sarah’s remarks were less communication than weather.

She hopped down from her stool and drifted toward the cutting table, casual as a cat, and stood beside me as if she’d always intended to.

“Interesting,” she murmured, under her breath, just for me.

I kept my eyes on the page. “What is.”

Sarah leaned slightly closer, coffee breath and mischief.

“Your posture,” she said. “It’s almost… saintly.”

I turned a page. Slowly. Deliberately.

“Don’t,” I said, quietly.

Sarah’s mouth twitched. “Oh, I’m not saying anything,” she replied, far too pleased.

I wrote. I didn’t look at her.

Sarah let the silence hang a moment longer, then softened her voice into something almost kind.

“She’s happy,” she said. “Properly happy.”

I felt my throat tighten.

“Yes,” I said, and kept it flat. “And she’s safe.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked toward Charli, who was bent over the pattern, focused, calm.

“She’s safer than she’s ever been,” Sarah murmured. “Because she’s got women who mean it.”

The remark landed like a compliment and a warning at the same time.

I finally looked at Sarah then.

Her expression was not mocking now. It was sharp, sure. Protective in her own acerbic way.

“As long as you keep your rules,” she added.

My pulse thudded once, irritated at being understood.

“I intend to,” I said.

Sarah held my gaze for half a beat, then lifted her cup in a small salute.

“Good,” she said, and wandered off as if she hadn’t just named my private war.

Charli finished the marking, handed the pattern back to Lucy, and moved to the next task without hovering.

As she passed my table, she didn’t touch me.

She didn’t glance at me too long.

She simply said, very quietly, “See you later,” like it was normal.

It was normal now.

It had to be.

“Later,” I replied, and kept my voice steady.

Charli walked away.

The room continued: scissors, chalk, small laughter, fabric sliding under palms.

Mara’s pen moved across the ledger like it always did. No drama. No indulgence. Only work.

And I stood in the middle of it, holding the rules like a scaffold I’d built with my own hands:

Off the clock.

No secrets.

No hooks.

No warmth used as currency.

I could do this.

I would do this.

Because the romance—when it came—would not be something I *took*.

It would be something I chose carefully, with both of us fully awake.

And that morning, watching Charli move through Wardrobe as if she belonged there by right, I felt the truth of it settle in my chest, steady and relentless:

The hardest part wasn’t wanting her.

The hardest part was making wanting her safe.

---

[Q]  
Broaching a delicate topic, now. Home scenes *have* to evolve. It can be Charli testing a new chemise--she actually wears it to bed. She's dressed in it one evening--nothing to dwell on, simple 1770's chemise--and Celeste is now seeing this girl as: fully girl. Her girl.

Now, as someone who *has* done a few years on Spironolactone and Sandrena: I can safely say that Charli's, um, "s** drive" is going to have been pretty much obliterated. For Charli, it's all emotional, absolutely *nothing* physical. Which suits Celeste... for now, emotional is what she wants to build/grow, without the complexity of 'physical'. The home environment changes: you can't have a moment like in the park and persistent cold austerity at home... incongruous. Both want more: tenderness, closeness... in a previous version of this scene, we had Celeste - reading the undeniable *permission* in Charli's eyes - lead (because, once again, Celeste guides the situation) Charli into bed with her and they "spoon", like girlfriends at a sleepover. That is the perfect emotional denouement, I should think. And, it's where we can leave the two of them and begin focusing on Sarah... and Lauren.

Yes… that’s a *beautifully* sound emotional landing pad — and it solves the tonal problem you flagged. You can’t have the park kiss and then return to “cold austerity” at home without the reader feeling whiplash. Home has to become **soft structure**: still guided by Celeste, still safe, but *livable*. 💛

One small craft note before I write: I’m going to keep this **tender, non-sexual, consent-forward**—the “sleepover spoon” you described. And I’ll frame it as **two adults** in a private, off-the-clock setting, so the intimacy is ethically clean and tonally true to Wardrobe’s standards.

Here’s a draft you can drop in as the next home scene.

---

## **Scene 36 — “Chemise” (Celeste POV)**

At home, the silence was different.

Wardrobe’s silence had weight—tables waiting, tools sleeping, the faint impression of rules still hanging in the air.

This silence was domestic. It had corners. It had soft light. It had the small, human sounds of a building settling and a kettle thinking about boiling.

Charli was staying over more often now.

Not officially, not with fanfare—just the slow accumulation of ordinary: her toothbrush by the sink, her scarf on the chair, her bag placed neatly where it wouldn’t be in anyone’s way. She still moved with care, but the care no longer looked like apology.

Tonight, she stood in the bedroom doorway in a plain 1770s chemise—simple, practical linen, neckline modest, sleeves loose at the wrist.

No lace. No teasing. No performance.

Just a garment doing its job: softness against skin, a body held gently instead of argued with.

“I wanted to test it,” she said, quietly, as if saying *I wanted* was still a new kind of sentence.

“Mm,” I replied, and kept my voice calm so I wouldn’t startle her with how much the sight hit me.

She had worn costumes before. She had worn garments that made her look like a girl. She had even worn them well.

But this—this wasn’t Wardrobe.

This was private.

This was a girl in her own quiet, choosing comfort.

She looked… fully herself.

Not because the chemise was magic. Because she was no longer carrying the old tension of *am I allowed?* in every muscle.

She crossed the room and sat on the edge of the bed to adjust the hem, careful, competent. She didn’t glance up for approval.

When she did look at me, her eyes were clear.

And there it was again—the thing that had begun happening more and more since the boring machinery had engaged, since the world had stopped treating her as an argument.

Permission.

Not permission to be *touched*.

Permission to be *close.*

There was a difference. She knew it. I knew it.

I sat beside her, leaving a respectful gap. I let the space exist long enough that it was a choice when I narrowed it.

“How does it feel?” I asked.

Charli took a breath, searching for words.

“Quiet,” she said finally.

A single word, and I understood the whole paragraph behind it.

Quiet body. Quiet panic. Quiet hunger for control.

Quiet enough to hear herself think.

“Good,” I said.

Charli’s hands rested in her lap. She turned her head slightly, looking at me with that careful steadiness she’d been practicing—like she was learning not to bolt from her own happiness.

“I… don’t really want anything,” she said, and then frowned, worried she’d said it wrong. “I mean— I want things. Just not… that.”

Her cheeks warmed.

I didn’t let her squirm. I didn’t let her apologise.

I simply nodded, as if she’d reported the weather.

“Okay,” I said. “Then we don’t do that.”

Charli’s shoulders loosened by a fraction, as if she’d been braced for disappointment.

“I just—” She swallowed. “I want to be… with you.”

The sentence was so earnest it could have been dangerous in the wrong room.

Here, it was just true.

I turned toward her fully.

“Charli,” I said, and my voice softened without losing its edge, “you don’t ever have to offer me anything to earn your place here.”

Her eyes shone, but she didn’t cry. She held herself steady.

“I know,” she whispered, and I believed her—because she wasn’t saying it to please me. She was saying it like a new rule she was finally starting to trust.

I let my hand hover, not touching, giving her the space to decide.

“May I?” I asked, and nodded toward her shoulder, the line of her sleeve.

Charli inhaled. Then, clearly:

“Yes.”

I put my hand on her shoulder—light, warm, nothing possessive about it. Just contact. Just reassurance made physical.

Charli leaned into it with a quiet, involuntary honesty.

I felt something in my chest go tight and then settle.

This, I thought. *This is what she means.*

Not heat. Not urgency.

Closeness.

The simple, devastating comfort of being held without a price tag.

I stood and pulled the covers back.

“Come on,” I said.

Charli hesitated—habit, not reluctance.

Her eyes flicked to mine, reading for the shape of the moment.

I kept it clean.

“Just sleep,” I said. “Like girlfriends. Like a sleepover. Nothing complicated.”

Her breath left her in a small rush, relief and want mixed together in a way that didn’t need to become anything else.

“Okay,” she whispered.

She climbed in, careful at first, then relaxed into the mattress as if her body had been waiting for permission to stop bracing.

I turned off the light, leaving only the soft spill from the hallway.

Then I slid in behind her, close enough to be felt.

I didn’t touch her immediately.

I let her decide the distance.

Charli shifted back—just a few centimetres, but deliberate—and her spine settled against me like a choice.

That was my permission.

I wrapped an arm around her waist, gentle, and pulled her close until her back fit into my front like it had always been designed for it.

Charli exhaled a long, shaky breath.

“Is this okay?” she asked, tiny.

“Yes,” I said. “This is perfect.”

Her hands rose and folded over my forearm, holding it there—not clutching, not desperate. Just anchoring.

We lay like that, breathing in the same rhythm.

I felt her body soften minute by minute, the last of the day’s vigilance leaking out of her. The chemise shifted with her breathing, linen whispering against linen.

No performance. No fear.

Just a girl being held.

And me—me letting myself hold her.

It should have felt like losing control.

Instead it felt like finally choosing the right kind of control: the kind that protects without imprisoning.

Charli’s voice came again, half-asleep.

“Thank you,” she murmured.

“For what?”

“For… being sure,” she said. “All the time.”

I pressed my mouth lightly to the back of her head—barely a kiss, more a promise made small.

“I’ll keep being sure,” I whispered.

Charli made a sound that was almost a laugh.

Then she went quiet.

Her breathing deepened.

The weight of her trust settled into my arm, heavy and real.

I lay awake for a while longer, listening to the building and the night, feeling the shape of her against me and understanding, with a clarity that didn’t frighten me anymore:

This was not a reward for progress.

This was not a prize for compliance.

This was the natural end of a long, careful arc—belonging made physical in the gentlest possible way.

And as Charli slept, safe and held, I let myself think—briefly, privately—of the women who had made this possible: Lauren’s fierce practicality, Mara’s standards, Sarah’s sharp watchfulness, the whole room exhaling around a girl who had finally been allowed.

Tomorrow, the story could widen again.

We could turn the camera toward Sarah. Toward Lauren. Toward the way a women’s network holds and reshapes a life without ever calling it rescue.

For tonight, I stayed still.

I held her.

And I let that be enough.

---

If you’d like, the next Sarah-facing scene can be deliciously sharp: she clocks the *change* in Charli’s confidence the next day and decides—without being told—that Celeste has crossed a line **on purpose**, and she approves *only because* Celeste kept it clean. 😉💛

---

Yes, please. Lovely idea...

## **Scene 37 — “Sarah’s Eyes” (Sarah POV)**

Wardrobe in the morning is a lie you tell yourself in order to function.

You walk in and pretend it’s just work—just fabric, just scissors, just steam and chalk and numbers—and if you do it well enough, you can almost forget that the room is actually a living thing that keeps score.

I arrive on time because I’m not feral.

Also because arriving early in Wardrobe is a type of currency, and I’m not in the mood to spend mine when I don’t need to.

The room is already doing its morning inhale: kettle click, iron hiss, Mara’s presence like a weather front you can feel before you see it. Celeste is at the ledger, of course. She looks annoyingly composed, the way she always looks when she’s holding three plans in her head and refusing to let anyone smell it.

Then Charli comes in.

And I *know*.

Not because she’s wearing something dramatic—she isn’t. Not because she’s suddenly strutting—she’s not. It’s subtler than that, which is why it’s so obvious.

It’s in the way she enters the room as if she expects the floor to hold her.

It’s in the way she hangs her bag without that tiny flinch, the old reflex of “am I in the way?” It’s in the way she washes her hands like it’s a ritual, not a penance.

Most of all it’s in her face.

Not prettier. Not different in any cheap, male-gaze way.

Just… settled.

Like someone’s turned down the background alarm.

I perch on my stool with my coffee and watch her move.

Charli goes straight to the cap station, checks the tie tension without fuss, and adjusts the knot by a millimetre like she’s been doing it her whole life. No apology. No looking around for permission. No waiting for someone to tell her she’s doing it right.

She already knows the standard.

That’s the entire difference.

A girl who believes she belongs behaves like a girl who belongs. Revolutionary concept, honestly.

I flick my eyes over to Celeste.

Celeste is writing in the ledger. Her face is neutral. Her posture is “adult.” Her whole body is saying: *Nothing to see here, everyone, please return to your assigned competence.*

And yet.

There’s a softness in her attention that wasn’t there before. Not the kind you can accuse her of. Not the kind that would get her hauled into some HR nightmare.

It’s more like a gravitational shift.

Like she’s orienting herself around Charli without letting anyone hear the click.

That’s how you know it’s serious.

Celeste doesn’t do sloppy.

Mara barks an instruction. Lucy passes a pattern. Tahlia mutters something about seam allowance like it’s a religion. The room keeps moving.

Charli keeps moving with it.

And the glow—yes, glow, I’ll say it because I’m not afraid of the word—doesn’t look like excitement.

It looks like safety.

Which is when it hits me, with the kind of clarity that makes me slightly annoyed:

They’ve crossed the line.

Not the obvious one. Not the scandal one. The *real* line.

The line where it stops being “we’re keeping her safe” and becomes “we’re keeping each other.”

I sip my coffee and watch Celeste’s hands.

I’ve watched those hands do brutal kindness. I’ve watched her set standards that make men wilt and women straighten. I’ve watched her make decisions that hold the room together without asking anyone’s permission.

If she’s chosen Charli, it won’t be accidental.

It also won’t be messy.

Which means I have only one question, really.

Is it clean?

I wait for the tell.

It comes a few minutes later, almost nothing: Charli passes close to Celeste’s table, pauses half a beat, and says softly, “Morning.”

Celeste doesn’t look up right away.

She finishes writing first.

Then she looks up, meets Charli’s eyes for exactly the length of time that is *appropriate*, and says, “Morning.”

No lingering. No smile that could be called indulgent. No warmth used like candy.

But Charli’s face changes—just a fraction—as if that single, controlled acknowledgement has landed somewhere deep and stabilising.

Charli moves on.

Celeste returns to the ledger.

And I understand, with reluctant admiration: yes.

Clean.

Off the clock, on the clock, it stays separate. Whatever they’re building, it isn’t being built on Charli’s neediness or Celeste’s power.

It’s being built on structure.

On consent.

On rules.

Which, in this room, is the closest thing we have to romance anyway.

I hop down from my stool and drift over to the ledger table because I’m me, and because if I don’t say something, my tongue will rot.

I lean an elbow on the edge—casual, but not careless. Mara would murder me if I left a coffee ring.

Celeste doesn’t look up.

“Interesting morning,” I say lightly.

Celeste’s pen continues moving. “Is it.”

“Yes,” I say. “You’re doing that thing where you pretend the room isn’t a room.”

That earns me a glance. Cool. Patient. Slightly murderous.

“Sarah,” she says, like a warning.

I hold up a hand. “Relax. I’m not asking for details.”

Celeste’s eyes narrow. “Good.”

I take a sip of coffee like I’ve got all day.

I lower my voice, because I’m not a monster.

“She looks good,” I say. “Properly good.”

Celeste’s pen pauses for the smallest moment.

Then resumes.

“Yes,” she says, flat.

I tilt my head. “And you?”

Celeste finally looks up fully.

Her face is calm. Too calm.

“Me,” she says, “am doing my job.”

I hum. “Mm. And your job is… what? Keeping distance forever? Or keeping it safe?”

Celeste’s gaze holds mine.

It’s not defensive.

It’s… sharp. Considered.

“Keeping it safe,” she says.

There it is.

No confession. No romance novel nonsense.

Just a woman stating her intention like a policy.

It should be cold.

It isn’t.

It’s devotion expressed in the only language Celeste trusts: responsibility.

I nod once.

“Good,” I say. “Because if you hurt her—”

“I won’t,” Celeste cuts in.

Not angry. Not dramatic.

Certain.

And I believe her.

Because I’ve watched her build a whole room out of certainty.

I let the threat dissolve into something more useful.

“I’m not worried you’ll hurt her,” I say, honest now. “I’m worried you’ll forget you’re allowed to want her.”

Celeste’s expression flickers—annoyance, maybe. Or recognition.

“Go back to your work, Sarah,” she says, and it’s the closest thing to tenderness she’s ever offered me.

I grin. “Gladly.”

I start to turn away, then pause.

“One more thing,” I add, softer.

Celeste sighs like she’s suffering.

I keep my eyes on the room, not on her.

“If she’s glowing,” I say, “it’s because she finally believes us.”

Celeste’s voice comes quiet, almost to herself.

“I know.”

I walk back to my stool and sit down.

Charli is at the table now, pinning cleanly, speaking easily to Bree, laughing without snatching the laugh back. She looks like a girl who has stopped waiting for the trap.

And Celeste—Celeste sits at the ledger with her spine straight and her face calm, doing her best impression of a woman who has everything under control.

Which, frankly, is adorable.

Because I can see the truth anyway.

The room has shifted.

The story has shifted.

And I, Sarah of the sharp tongue and the excellent instincts, will be damned if I don’t keep one eye on it—not to interfere, not to gossip, but to make sure the rules stay what they are:

No hooks.

No spectacle.

No men’s ideas of romance.

Just two women doing the only thing that matters.

Keeping it clean.

Keeping her safe.

And letting love grow the way it should:

Quietly.

Deliberately.

Like a seam you don’t notice until you realise the whole garment finally fits.

##

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ap.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

I'm eliminating the "Just One Pint" scene now, because: developments. It doesn't fit anymore. Actually, what does fit is since we've started seeing life through Sarah's lens, we can have her struggling with a relationship with a fellow who has a few issues: 1) dependency on his mum - no domestic skills at all 2) seeing Sarah as 'replacement mum'... last thing Sarah wants and 3) realising she's over him, and is starting to cling. He's a bit entitled, so she ends up having to get a restraining order. She shares all this with Bree, who is gay. Bree jokingly suggests women as a better option. Time for Charli's classic line: "*I'm* a fan!" Sarah shrugs them off. Goes for an evening out, gets caught up in another toxic situation, ends up drinking too much and then, in strife, ringing Lauren in desperation.

Plausible?

---

Yes — *plausible*, and (importantly) it **fits your newer architecture**: Wardrobe as a women-led competence network that handles boundary breaches with boring, effective systems. Sarah’s arc becomes a *parallel proof* that the rules aren’t “for Charli”—they’re for **any woman dealing with male entitlement**. 💛🧵

A few tweaks will make it feel *inevitable* rather than “plotty,” especially the restraining order + drunk call beat.

---

## What’s already working ✅

### 1) The “replacement mum” dynamic is painfully real

A bloke with no domestic skills + emotional dependency + weaponised helplessness → it’s believable that he tries to convert Sarah into **manager / nurse / mother**.

Sarah’s not a caretaker by temperament. So her disgust/anger will read true.

### 2) The escalation to “cling + entitlement” fits the tone

Men who feel “owed” access often escalate **after** a woman withdraws: more calls, guilt, showing up, “I just want to talk,” then anger when denied.

That’s a clean through-line to formal boundaries.

### 3) Bree as the confidante is perfect

Bree’s humour keeps it from becoming grim, and her queerness lets you seed the “women are better” banter without turning it into a PSA.

Charli’s line — **“I’m a fan!”** — is a *great* moment: light, disarming, and a reminder that Charli’s belonging is now easy enough to be playful.

---

## Two places to be careful (so it stays believable)

### A) Restraining order: make it feel earned, not sudden

A restraining order won’t feel abrupt if you show a short **escalation ladder**:

1. Sarah ends it clearly (one clean message).
2. He ignores it → repeated texts/calls, guilt, “you’re cruel.”
3. He escalates → turns up at home/work; waits outside; “accidental” encounters.
4. Sarah documents + asks him once, firmly, to stop.
5. He escalates again (or threatens / damages / refuses to leave) → Sarah goes formal.

You don’t need procedural detail. Just show Sarah being *methodical* (screenshots, dates, single clear boundary statement), because that’s the Wardrobe ethos in civilian clothes.

### B) The “drinks too much and calls Lauren” beat: make it grounded

It works best if it’s **not** “party girl spirals,” but “Sarah hit her limit.”

A clean setup:

* Sarah goes out specifically to prove she’s fine.
* She gets cornered by another toxic man (or the ex turns up).
* She drinks *faster than she realises* because she’s stressed, not because she’s reckless.
* The “call Lauren” comes from **risk assessment**: “I’m not safe to get home. I need a woman who will just handle this.”

That’s both plausible and consistent with your theme.

---

## Who should Sarah call — and why Lauren is a smart choice

Lauren is *mum energy* but not smothering; she’s competent, practical, and already in the “women protect women” circuit.

Also, it creates a satisfying triangle of competence:

* **Mara** = standards at work
* **Celeste** = direction + emotional intelligence
* **Lauren** = logistics + mother-steel in the real world

Sarah calling Lauren is Sarah admitting: *I’m not above needing the network.* That’s lovely character growth for her.

---

## How I’d stage it (tight and non-contrived)

### Scene 1: “Weaponised Helplessness” (Sarah POV)

* Guy can’t cook, can’t clean, calls his mum for everything.
* Sarah realises she’s being recruited as **project manager** of his life.
* She breaks it off with surgical clarity.

### Scene 2: “Cling” (Sarah POV)

* He escalates: texts, calls, guilt, shows up.
* Bree is the one Sarah vents to.
* Bree jokes: “Women are easier.”
* Charli, passing through, deadpan: **“I’m a fan.”**
* Sarah rolls her eyes, laughs despite herself. (Good tonal relief.)

### Scene 3: “Formal” (Lauren POV *or* Sarah POV)

* One incident crosses a line: he shows up at Wardrobe / her home, won’t leave.
* Sarah goes formal. Not emotional. “I’m done. Stop.”
* She files whatever she needs to. You can keep it as: “paperwork and a magistrate and a lot of waiting.”

### Scene 4: “The Call” (Sarah POV)

* Sarah goes out. Another man misreads her as available/pliable.
* She drinks too fast. Realises she’s unsafe to manage herself.
* She calls Lauren, voice tight: “I need you. No questions. Please.”

Lauren arrives. No judgement. Just action.

That sequence will feel grimly plausible and very “your” story.

---

## One small adjustment I’d suggest

Instead of “another toxic situation” being random, make it **connected**:

* The ex turns up at the venue (or has friends there).
* Or Sarah’s shaken confidence makes her misjudge someone who seems “fine.”

This keeps it from feeling episodic, and it reinforces the theme: male entitlement is ambient, not exceptional.

---

If you want, I can draft the next Sarah POV scene in your current voice — acerbic, observant, allergic to male nonsense — including the Bree/Charli moment and the first clean boundary message that sets up the escalation. 😌🖋️

---

Perfect. Yes, please do, keeping at the cautions in mind you suggest.

## Ethan

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116aq.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

## **Scene 38 — “Weaponised Helplessness” (Sarah POV)**

There are men who are genuinely incompetent.

And then there are men who are competent enough to *choose* incompetence, because it’s such an efficient way to outsource their lives.

Ethan—of course his name is Ethan—falls firmly into the second category.

I realise it on a Tuesday, which is rude. Tuesday is supposed to be neutral. Tuesday is supposed to be emails and decent coffee and fabric that behaves.

Instead, I’m standing in his kitchen watching him hold a saucepan like it’s a live animal.

“I don’t really… cook,” he says, as if that’s a personality trait, not a survival skill.

The fridge behind him is full of things that aren’t meals. Milk. Eggs. Sauce bottles. A container labelled *Mum’s lasagne* in handwriting so obviously not his that I almost laugh.

“You live alone,” I say.

He grins. “Yeah, but Mum—”

“—does it,” I finish for him.

He blinks. “She likes helping.”

Ah. That familiar line. The one that translates as: *I’ve trained a woman into my domestic life and I’m looking for a replacement model.*

There are other tells.

The way he hands me a plate to wash without asking, like my hands are a service he’s entitled to activate.

The way he says “I’m terrible at laundry” like it’s cute.

The way he brings up moving in together after six weeks, and it’s not because he loves me. It’s because he’s spotted an upgrade path: from Mum to Girlfriend Mum.

At one point he looks genuinely confused that I’m not charmed.

“You’re really organised,” he says. “I like that about you.”

I stare at him.

That’s not a compliment. That’s a job description.

I go home and lie in bed, staring at the ceiling, and I feel something in my chest settle into a hard, clean shape.

I am over him.

Not “thinking about being over him.”

Over him. Done.

So the next day, I do it properly.

I call him. Not text. Not a long message he can forward to his mates for sport.

A call. Clear. Brief. Unambiguous.

“Hi,” I say, and keep my voice neutral. “This isn’t working for me. I’m ending it. I’m not interested in continuing, and I’m not changing my mind.”

There’s a pause on the line where he tries to find the angle.

“Is this about that kitchen thing?” he asks, laughing slightly, like it’s banter.

“It’s about compatibility,” I say. “We’re not compatible.”

Another pause.

Then the tone shifts.

“Oh,” he says, slowly. “So what, you’re just… dumping me.”

“Yes,” I say, because men love euphemisms when they’re losing. “I am.”

He exhales sharply, offended. “Right. Okay. Wow. I didn’t think you were like that.”

I blink.

Like what? A woman with a spine?

“I’m being clear,” I say.

He tries a new tactic. Softness. “Sarah, come on. I just need you to tell me what I did wrong.”

“I’m not your coach,” I say, calm as a surgeon. “Goodbye, Ethan.”

And I end the call.

I don’t block him immediately.

That’s not optimism. That’s evidence-gathering.

It’s not my first rodeo.

---

At Wardrobe, I don’t announce any of this. I don’t want a round of sympathy from women who could weaponise empathy with a single raised eyebrow.

I do, however, allow myself one confession: to Bree, because Bree can make anything bearable by laughing at it without minimising it.

She’s at the big table sorting a bag of pins like they’ve personally offended her.

“How’s Mr. Tuesday?” she asks without looking up.

I drop my tote on the floor and exhale.

“He’s been returned to sender.”

Bree looks up, delighted. “Ooh. That bad?”

“He doesn’t cook,” I say.

Bree’s eyebrows lift. “Like… doesn’t cook as in doesn’t enjoy it? Or doesn’t cook as in would starve without a woman?”

“As in,” I say, “his fridge contains *Mum’s lasagne* and a faith-based relationship with Uber Eats.”

Bree snorts. “Oh no.”

“Oh yes,” I say. “And he’s got that thing. That *thing* where he looks at you like you’re a solution to his life.”

Bree winces. “Replacement mum.”

“Replacement mum,” I confirm. “Like I’ve got ‘domestic manager’ stamped on my forehead.”

Bree taps the pin tray once. “I’d rather chew glass.”

“Exactly.”

Charli is nearby, at the cap table, adjusting ties with that new calm she wears like it belongs to her. She’s listening without looking like she’s listening, which is a skill women develop early.

Bree, with perfect timing, says, “Honestly, babe. Women are just… better.”

She says it jokingly—mostly. Bree always says jokes like she means them and means things like they’re jokes.

I roll my eyes. “Oh, here we go.”

Charli, without looking up, drops in with a deadpan that makes me choke on my own air.

“I’m a fan.”

Bree *howls*, delighted. Tahlia makes a choking noise behind a sleeve. Even Lucy’s mouth twitches as if her face is briefly considering humour before rejecting it on principle.

I glare at them all, purely for show.

“Oh, shut up,” I say. “All of you.”

Charli smiles—real, unguarded—and goes back to tying her knot like she hasn’t just thrown a grenade of charm into my morning.

It’s infuriating how likeable she’s become.

Bree wipes her eyes. “So,” she says, recovering. “He took it well?”

“He took it like a man who’s never been told no without being offered a biscuit afterwards,” I say.

Bree’s expression shifts—still amused, but alert. “Meaning?”

“Meaning he tried sad,” I say. “Then tried offended. Then tried making it my fault.”

Bree points a pin at me. “And you?”

“I was clear,” I say. “No explanation. No negotiation.”

Bree’s approving nod is small but fierce. “Good girl.”

I give her a look.

Bree grins. “Sorry. Bad habit.”

“Mm.”

I should stop there. Wrap it up. Move on.

But my phone buzzes in my pocket like a warning.

I pull it out.

A message from Ethan.

> **Ethan:** Wow. Okay. So that’s it? After everything?
> **Ethan:** I’m outside. We need to talk.

I go very still.

Bree’s smile fades when she sees my face.

“He’s not,” Bree says quietly. “He’s not outside here.”

I look toward the front windows. Nothing. No man at the gate. No shape lingering.

“No,” I say. “Not here.”

Charli’s head lifts slightly. Not panicked. Just attentive. The room’s temperature changes by half a degree—women becoming aware.

I keep my voice calm because I refuse to bring chaos into Wardrobe.

“He’s at my place,” I say.

Bree’s mouth tightens. “Do you want me to call someone?”

“No,” I say. “Not yet.”

I take one breath. Then I do what Mara would do.

I handle it clean.

I type one message back. No emotion. No opening. No softness he can grab.

> **Me:** Do not come to my home. Do not wait for me. Do not contact me again.
> **Me:** If you come near me or my work, I will treat it as harassment and I will act accordingly.

I hit send.

Then, because I’m not daft, I screenshot it.

I create a folder.

**Ethan — dates**

It’s grim how quickly that feels normal.

Bree watches me do it and nods once, approval like a stamp.

Charli’s eyes stay on my face for a beat—quietly concerned, quietly present—then she drops her gaze back to her work, giving me privacy without withdrawing support.

That’s Wardrobe culture in action: *you are not alone, but you are not made into a spectacle.*

The kettle clicks. The iron hisses. Mara’s shears bite through fabric.

Life continues.

My phone buzzes again.

I don’t look at it immediately.

I finish what my hands are doing first, because control is sometimes as simple as choosing the order of actions.

Then I pick it up.

Another message.

> **Ethan:** You can’t do this to me.
> **Ethan:** I just want to talk. Stop being dramatic.

I stare at the words for a moment, feeling something cold and familiar settle in my ribs.

There it is.

The entitlement, plain as daylight.

*Access* framed as *need.*
My boundary framed as *drama.*

Bree’s voice is low. “Sarah.”

“I know,” I say.

I don’t reply.

Not now.

Because the next reply will be the kind that changes the game. The kind that invites escalation if you do it wrong.

I slide my phone back into my pocket and lift my chin.

“Work,” I say, mostly to myself.

Bree’s grin returns—smaller, harder. “Work,” she echoes.

And Charli, from the cap table, says quietly, almost under her breath:

“You won’t get used to that.”

I glance at her.

She meets my eyes with a calm that isn’t pity and isn’t fear.

Just truth.

I exhale once, slow.

“No,” I agree. “I won’t.”

And I go back to the table, letting the room hold steady around me, while somewhere outside of it a man realises—too late—that I am not his mother, and I am not his solution.

I am his boundary.

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ar.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

## **Scene 39 — “Pear-Shaped” (Sarah POV)**

It’s amazing how quickly a man can turn your boundary into his *personal tragedy*.

It’s also amazing how many of them genuinely believe that if they feel bad enough, the world will be obligated to comfort them.

Ethan doesn’t reply for an hour.

Which should have been a gift.

Instead it’s the quiet before the weather front.

By lunch I’ve had three missed calls.

By mid-afternoon he’s discovered email.

By four, there’s a notification from my building manager.

**Someone is downstairs asking for you. Says it’s urgent.**

I don’t even need to ask who.

My stomach doesn’t drop anymore. It goes cold. Efficient. Clinical.

I don’t leave my station. I don’t bolt. I don’t make it theatre.

I walk to Lauren’s corner of the room—because Lauren is the adult in the civilian world the way Mara is the adult in fabric—and I keep my voice low.

“He’s at my building,” I say.

Lauren’s face changes. Not into panic. Into calculation.

“Do you feel unsafe right now?” she asks.

“No,” I say. “But he’s escalating.”

Lauren nods once. “Okay. You’re not going home alone.”

“I’m not going home at all,” I say.

Lauren’s eyes flick to Mara, then back to me, as if checking what kind of support this room is allowed to give without turning into a rescue fantasy.

“Bree,” Lauren calls, matter-of-fact. Not loud. Just… inevitable.

Bree appears instantly, like she was waiting.

Lauren’s voice stays calm. “Sarah’s got a boundary issue. You’re her buddy for the rest of the shift. She doesn’t walk to her car alone. She doesn’t go anywhere alone. Clear?”

Bree’s grin is gone now. “Clear.”

Mara doesn’t look up. She taps her pen once against the ledger—tick, tick—as if she’s underlining Lauren’s sentence in her own language: **standards.**

Charli is at the cap table, and I feel her attention land on me like a soft hand. She doesn’t come over. She doesn’t insert herself.

She just… holds the room steady by existing in it.

Which is a strange kind of comfort.

I text the building manager back.

**Do not let him up. Tell him to leave. If he refuses, call police.**

Then I screenshot that too.

Evidence-gathering. Boring. Miraculous.

An hour later, another message comes in—this time from Ethan, of course.

> **Ethan:** You’re being insane.
> **Ethan:** I’m not leaving until you talk to me.
> **Ethan:** Don’t make me do something stupid.

There it is.

The classic line that tries to turn his behaviour into *my* responsibility.

My hands don’t shake. That’s the gift of being furious.

I show Lauren the screen.

Lauren’s jaw tightens, and she says, very quietly, “Nope.”

Not “oh no.”

Not “are you okay?”

Just: **nope.**

The word of a woman who has seen this move before and has zero intention of playing.

“Right,” she says. “We go formal.”

I blink. “Already?”

Lauren’s gaze is steady. “Sarah, he’s using implied threat language and turning up at your home. That’s already formal.”

I exhale slowly, because she’s right, and because I hate being right about men.

Lauren pulls her phone out, taps once, twice.

“Leave it with me,” she says. “You keep screenshots. Dates. Times. Don’t reply. Don’t explain. Don’t negotiate.”

It’s such a Lauren sentence: a list that becomes a lifeline.

Bree leans in beside me. “I’ll stay at yours tonight,” she says, like it’s nothing, like she’s offering to water a plant. “Or you stay at mine. Dealer’s choice.”

I look at her, touched in a way that is infuriating.

“I’m fine,” I say automatically.

Bree raises an eyebrow. “You’re not fine, babe. You’re just competent.”

Fair.

---

By the time the shift ends, I have a plan.

Not a dramatic plan.

A boring plan.

Lauren drives, Bree in the passenger seat, me in the back like a teenager being escorted home after a questionable party.

It’s humiliating.

Which means it’s good for me.

We don’t go to my building. We don’t reward his persistence with my presence. We go to Bree’s place first, because Bree has the kind of tiny apartment where a man would look ridiculous standing outside.

Lauren calls my building manager while we’re parked.

Her tone is polite enough to pass, steel enough to cut glass.

“Yes, thank you… no, I understand… please document that in your log… yes, call immediately if he returns… yes, we will be taking further steps.”

She ends the call and looks at me.

“He left,” she says. “But he’ll come back. So we close the loop.”

I swallow. “What loop.”

“The one where he thinks access is negotiable,” Lauren says.

We spend the next hour doing paperwork in the most unromantic way possible: names, times, screenshots, a short statement that says exactly what happened and nothing more.

Lauren doesn’t embellish. She doesn’t plead. She doesn’t tell a story.

She gives facts.

It’s terrifying how effective facts are when a woman uses them like a blade.

By the end of the night, I have an interim safety plan, a number to call, and a list of instructions so dull they could be a laundry guide.

Bree makes tea. Not to soothe. To keep us upright.

When Lauren finally stands to leave, she pauses at the door.

“Sarah,” she says, and her voice softens just a notch. “This isn’t your fault.”

I roll my eyes because I need to.

“I know.”

Lauren’s gaze doesn’t let me wriggle away.

“No,” she repeats gently. “*Really* know.”

I look away. Then back.

“I know,” I say again, and this time I mean it.

Lauren nods once, satisfied.

“I’ll check on you tomorrow,” she says. “And if he appears at Wardrobe, Mara will eat him alive.”

“Delicately,” Bree adds.

Lauren’s mouth twitches. “With a fork.”

She leaves.

Bree locks the door behind her, then looks at me with something like a sister’s appraisal.

“You want to go out tomorrow night?” she asks. “Just… shake it off?”

I huff. “You think I need shaking off.”

Bree points at me. “You need reminding that your life doesn’t belong to some man who can’t boil pasta.”

I hate that she’s right.

So I say, “Fine.”

---

The next night, I dress like myself.

Not sexy. Not soft. Not “approachable.”

I put on black jeans and boots and a top that says: **I know where my keys are**.

We go to a place Bree likes—music, crowd, women who laugh like they own their lungs.

For the first hour, it works.

I loosen. I laugh. I even forget to look at the door.

Then a man slides into our orbit like smoke.

He’s not Ethan. He’s the *same type*, just with better hair.

He talks to Bree as if I’m invisible, then talks to me as if I’m a resource. He’s charming in the way men are charming when they’re used to women smoothing the awkward parts for them.

I can feel myself tensing—old instincts waking up.

Bree clocks it and leans into my ear.

“Want me to bite him?” she whispers.

“I want you to set him on fire,” I mutter.

Bree snorts.

I decide to handle it like an adult.

I say, clear and calm, “We’re not interested.”

He smiles as if I’ve flirted.

“Aw, come on,” he says. “Don’t be like that.”

I feel the rage flicker—cold, familiar.

“Like what,” I say, sweetly. “A woman who said no?”

His smile tightens.

“Oh,” he says. “You’re one of those.”

Bree’s eyes flash. “And you’re one of *those*,” she replies, bright as a knife.

He laughs like we’re entertainment. He reaches for my elbow.

My whole body goes still.

Not fear.

History.

I step back.

“Don’t touch me,” I say.

He lifts both hands in mock surrender.

“Relax.”

Bree’s hand is suddenly on my back, steady.

“We’re leaving,” she says.

And we do.

We walk out into the night air, and it’s like walking from heat into cold water.

My hands are shaking now.

Bree looks at me. “You okay?”

I open my mouth to say yes.

Instead I say, “I’m furious.”

Bree nods, satisfied. “Good. Fury’s honest.”

We should go home.

We don’t.

Because I’m stubborn, and because part of me wants to prove I’m not a woman who has to retreat.

So when Bree suggests a quieter bar two streets over, I say yes.

And there—there is where I make my mistake.

I drink too fast.

Not because I’m trying to get drunk.

Because my nervous system is trying to come down and I’m sick of being vigilant.

One drink becomes two. Two becomes three.

My body softens before my mind is ready for it.

And then my phone buzzes.

A blocked number.

My stomach clenches.

Another buzz.

Another.

Bree’s face tightens when she sees mine.

“It’s him,” I say.

Bree grabs my hand. “We’re going. Now.”

But the street tilts a little when I stand. Not dramatic. Just enough.

Bree swears softly. “Okay. Okay. We’re fine. We get a rideshare—”

My brain does a quick, ugly calculation: my address, my building, Ethan’s persistence, the risk of being dropped at the wrong place, the risk of fumbling keys.

I do the only competent thing left.

I call the most competent woman I know who will not ask questions first.

Lauren.

She answers on the second ring.

“Sarah?”

My voice comes out too careful.

“Lauren,” I say. “I need you.”

There’s no sigh. No judgement. No lecture.

Just immediate clarity.

“Where are you?” she asks.

I tell her.

“Stay where you are,” she says. “With Bree?”

“Yes.”

“Good. I’m coming.”

I blink hard, suddenly close to tears, which is ridiculous.

“Thank you,” I manage.

Lauren’s voice stays firm.

“No thanks,” she says. “Just sit down and wait. I’ll be there.”

The line clicks off.

Bree wraps an arm around my shoulders, guiding me to a bench like I weigh nothing.

“You did good,” she says.

I laugh once, sharp and humourless.

“I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grins. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

I close my eyes for a second and breathe in the night.

And in the small, humiliating quiet of needing help, something in me loosens—something stubborn and old.

Maybe competence isn’t never needing anyone.

Maybe it’s knowing exactly which woman to call when the world goes pear-shaped.

---

If you’d like, the next scene can be **Lauren POV** arriving: brisk, protective, *no drama*, and she quietly clocks the deeper pattern (male entitlement, Sarah’s exhaustion, the way women keep having to do paperwork to be left alone). Then we can pivot back toward Wardrobe the next morning where Mara gets the one-sentence update and simply says: “Good. Now you’re done with him.” 💛

## **Scene 40 — “No Questions First” (Lauren POV)**

When Sarah rings you at night, you answer.

Not because she’s fragile—Sarah is many things, but fragile isn’t one of them.

You answer because women who don’t ask for help until they *have* to are the ones who end up in trouble when they finally do.

I was in the kitchen when the call came in, rinsing a mug and thinking about nothing in particular. The sound of my phone was ordinary.

The reason for it wasn’t.

“Lauren?” Sarah’s voice was careful—too careful. Tight at the edges. Like she was trying to keep her pride from spilling into the call.

“Sarah,” I said. “Where are you?”

There was a pause, a swallow. “Near—” she named a street. A venue. A landmark. Bree’s name followed like a relief valve. “Bree’s with me.”

Good. One woman, at least.

“Stay where you are,” I said. “Sit down. Don’t go anywhere alone. I’m coming.”

“Thank you,” she said, as if she hated the words.

“No thanks,” I replied. “Just wait.”

I hung up, grabbed my keys, and sent one text to Celeste.

**Going to pick up Sarah + Bree. Will update.**

No explanation. Celeste didn’t need a story. She needed the fact.

On the way out I glanced at Charli’s shoes by the door—neatly placed, toes aligned—and felt the small, familiar pinch in my chest that came with seeing my child’s life overlapping someone else’s home.

Not my home. Not quite yet.

But safe enough.

That was the point.

I drove through the city with my jaw set and my hands steady on the wheel. Not because I was calm. Because I had practice. Motherhood trains you to turn panic into logistics.

I thought, briefly, of the folder on my phone—screenshots, dates, times. The unromantic evidence of a woman being asked to manage a man’s feelings.

I didn’t need the details to know the shape of it.

You could tell the shape from the call alone.

*Help, but don’t make me beg.*

When I pulled up, I spotted them immediately.

Bree on a bench, arm around Sarah’s shoulders, posture angled outward like a shield. Sarah sitting upright, chin lifted, eyes too bright in the streetlight. She looked… competent and unwell at the same time, which is a particular kind of danger.

I parked, got out, and walked over without running. If I ran, it became drama. If it became drama, Sarah would recoil.

“Hi,” I said, as if this were nothing more than a late pick-up from the airport.

Bree stood first. “Hey,” she replied, brisk and grateful. “She’s okay. Just… overloaded.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to my face, assessing. Expecting judgement. Expecting *mum voice.*

She got something else.

“Okay,” I said. “Let’s get you home.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened. “I can—”

“No,” I said, not unkind. “You can’t. Not tonight. Not safely.”

The word safely wasn’t a reprimand. It was a standard. Something you either met or you didn’t.

Sarah swallowed. Then she nodded once, small.

Bree opened the back door. Sarah moved toward it, but her steps weren’t as precise as her pride wanted them to be. Bree steadied her without fuss.

I waited until Sarah was seated before I spoke again.

“Seatbelt,” I said, calm.

Sarah clicked it, cheeks flushing.

Bree slid into the front passenger seat. I got in, shut the door, and took a breath.

Only then did I ask the first question.

“Is he contacting you right now?” I asked, keeping my eyes on the road as I pulled away.

Sarah’s laugh was dry. “That’s your first question.”

“Yes,” I said. “Because that’s the only one that matters this minute.”

Bree angled her phone toward me. “Blocked calls,” she said. “A few.”

I nodded once, already making a mental list.

“Good,” I said. “We’ll document. You don’t answer.”

Sarah leaned her head back against the seat, eyes closed for a moment. “I didn’t,” she muttered. “I didn’t answer.”

“I know,” I said. “You called me.”

That, apparently, was the right thing to say, because Sarah’s throat moved and she didn’t speak for a few seconds.

Bree glanced at her, then looked forward again, jaw tight.

“He’s not Ethan,” Bree said. “Tonight was… a different one.”

I felt my stomach go cold.

“Different one,” I repeated, keeping my voice steady.

Bree nodded. “Some bloke. Grabby. The usual. We left.”

Sarah spoke then, voice low. “I said no. He acted like I’d flirted.”

Of course he did.

I kept my eyes on the road. There were two things I could do right now: give empathy, or give stability.

Sarah needed stability.

“Okay,” I said. “So: two problems. One, the ex. Two, the world.”

Bree barked a laugh. Sarah’s mouth twitched, almost despite herself.

“Lucky me,” Sarah muttered.

“Not luck,” I said, and let the steel in my voice come through. “Patterns. We deal with patterns.”

I pulled up at Bree’s building, because that’s where Sarah needed to be tonight: somewhere she wouldn’t feel hunted, somewhere she wouldn’t have to walk from car to door alone while her brain did ugly arithmetic.

Bree got out first, opened Sarah’s door, offered an arm.

Sarah hesitated, pride flaring.

I cut it off clean.

“Sarah,” I said, quiet. “Don’t be brave at the wrong time.”

She stared at me for a beat. Then, grudgingly, she took Bree’s arm and stepped out.

Inside, Bree’s place was small and warm—women’s clutter, shoes kicked off, a throw blanket draped like an afterthought. Bree guided Sarah to the couch and handed her a glass of water with the calm authority of someone who has done triage.

I sat opposite them and opened my phone.

“All right,” I said. “We do boring now.”

Sarah squinted. “Boring.”

“Yes,” I replied. “Screenshots. Dates. Times. Building manager log. One clean statement. No essays.”

Bree hovered behind the couch, arms folded. “I love you,” she told me, deadpan.

Sarah groaned. “Please don’t.”

I ignored both of them and held my phone out.

“Sarah,” I said. “Send me the message thread.”

Sarah stiffened. “Why?”

“Because if you’re rattled,” I said evenly, “you might answer by accident. Or delete something out of shame. Or forget a detail you’ll need later. I’m not letting your nervous system do admin.”

Sarah stared at me, then exhaled sharply.

“Fine,” she muttered. “God.”

“Thank you,” I replied, and waited.

Sarah unlocked her phone, scrolled, and began forwarding screenshots. Each one landed in my messages like a pebble in a jar—small, ordinary, cumulative.

Ethan’s language was exactly what I expected.

You can’t do this to me.
Stop being dramatic.
I just need to talk.
I’m outside.

None of it technically violent.

All of it coercive.

A man trying to turn “no” into “not yet.”

I felt my mouth go tight.

I made a folder.

**Sarah — Ethan — Jan**

Then another:

**Venue incident — notes**

Not because I wanted to build a case tonight.

Because I wanted Sarah to know—without me saying it—that this wasn’t chaos.

It was manageable.

Sarah watched my hands moving with a kind of exhausted relief that made my chest ache. She didn’t want to be mothered.

She wanted the world to be structured again.

Bree crouched beside her on the couch and spoke softly.

“You did the right thing calling Lauren,” Bree said.

Sarah snorted. “I called someone’s mum.”

Bree grinned. “Better than becoming someone’s mum.”

Sarah’s laugh cracked into something almost real. Then she rubbed her face with both hands, sudden vulnerability slipping through.

“I’m so tired,” she said, and the words were barely audible.

I didn’t soften into pity. Pity makes women smaller. Sarah would rather crawl out of her skin.

So I gave her something else.

A plan.

“Okay,” I said. “Tonight: you sleep here. Bree stays with you. Phone on Do Not Disturb. If he calls, you do nothing. If he shows up, you do not engage. You call police. Period.”

Sarah’s eyes flashed. “That’s dramatic.”

“It’s not dramatic,” I said. “It’s procedure.”

The word procedure landed like a handrail. Sarah’s shoulders lowered by a fraction.

“Tomorrow,” I continued, “we update your building manager. We confirm he’s not allowed entry. We take your documentation and we file what needs filing. And if he appears at Wardrobe, you do not handle it alone.”

Sarah blinked. “He wouldn’t—”

“He might,” I said. “Men like this confuse public space with entitlement space. We don’t assume good behaviour.”

Bree nodded sharply. “Mara will eat him.”

“With a fork,” I said.

Sarah’s mouth twitched again. Then, finally, her voice went small—rare for her.

“Okay,” she said.

Not “fine.”

Not “whatever.”

Okay.

I stood.

“I’ll check on you in the morning,” I said. “And Sarah?”

She looked up.

I held her gaze and made the sentence as plain as a ledger entry.

“This isn’t your fault.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened, reflexively allergic to comfort.

“I know,” she said.

I didn’t let it slide.

“No,” I repeated, quiet and firm. “Really know.”

Something in her face shifted—anger, grief, exhaustion—then settled.

“I know,” she said again, and this time it sounded like she was trying to believe it.

“Good,” I said. “Because you’re not going to carry his behaviour like it’s your responsibility.”

Sarah swallowed. She nodded once.

Bree reached for her hand and squeezed it.

I left them there—two women on a couch, one holding, one being held—because that was the whole point of the network.

Not rescue.

Not melodrama.

Just women refusing to let another woman be alone in a moment that could have tipped her into danger.

On the drive home, my phone buzzed once.

A text from Celeste.

**All okay?**

I replied without stopping at a red light, because some things mattered more than traffic etiquette.

**Sarah safe. Bree with her. Ex escalating; we’re going formal. Will brief Mara tomorrow.**

I put the phone down.

The streetlights slid past.

And I felt, with a strange, steady clarity, the way all of this rhymed.

Charli. Sarah. Bree. Celeste. Mara.

Different stories, same pattern: women tightening the net under one another, quietly, methodically, refusing to let male entitlement be the unchallenged weather of their lives.

Tomorrow, we’d do the boring things again.

Paperwork. Logs. Rules.

The unglamorous machinery of women making the world safe enough to live in.

And I would do it without apology.

To back away from the "all men are jerks" trope, I thought of this approach. 1) Sarah's POV, at work, Faire actresses come in, Lily on Bree's arm (so to speak, radiant happiness between the two. Sarah has a bit of an awakening: they look happy. But also, they look attractive. 2) Sarah finds an actual nice bloke, (Carl) and they date. Carl's wanting more, Sarah's feeling resistance, thinking it's fear of repeat performance. Tells him, he respects her, Carl gives her space. 3) Sarah tries again with Carl and then realises she's just not attracted to him. She feels it's better to be honest and tell him: they go their separate ways (even though she can tell it hurt him). 4) Guilt drives her to drink again. She - against her better judgment goes out alone, drinks too much. Feels ill (someone spiked her drink) and runs out of the bar in a panic,ringing the person that 'rescued' her the last time: Lauren. Spends the night at Lauren's. And, in the morning, after the hangover starts to subside, realises that Lauren means more to her than a safety blanket.

Yes — this is *very* plausible, and it neatly solves the “all men are jerks” flattening without backing away from your theme (male entitlement as ambient weather, not every individual bloke as a cartoon villain) 💛🧵

What I love about your new shape is that it gives Sarah a **clean comparative experiment**:

* She sees **women-love-women happiness** up close (Bree + Lily), and it lands in her body before it lands in her brain.
* She then meets a **genuinely decent man** (Carl) who behaves well — and the story shows that decency isn’t the issue. Attraction is.
* The painful honesty of ending it (and her guilt) pushes her into a familiar coping mechanism (drink), which sets up the spiking incident without moralising: it’s not “Sarah is irresponsible,” it’s “Sarah is tired and lonely and misreading her own needs.”
* Lauren as the rescuer the second time becomes the hinge: the morning after, Sarah realises the truth isn’t “Lauren is safe,” it’s “Lauren is *wanted*.”

That is a *gorgeous* pivot into romance that doesn’t require any man-bashing. Carl can even become a quiet proof-point: **men can be kind; Sarah still wants women.**

### A tiny craft caution (so it doesn’t feel contrived)

The “spiked drink” beat will land best if you make it **uncertain and sensory** rather than declarative:

* Sarah feels an abrupt, wrong shift: dizziness too fast for her intake, nausea, heat/cold, trembling, time-skips.
* She *suspects* spiking (and later Lauren might say: “You should get checked” / “We can report it”), but you don’t need to prove it on-page.
* Keep the focus on *Sarah’s fear + decision-making*, not the perpetrator.

That keeps it grounded and avoids turning the story into a crime procedural.

## Suggested scene packaging (so it flows)

If you like numbering continuity, I’d do:

* **Scene 41 — “Radiant” (Sarah POV)**: Wardrobe day, Faire actresses arrive; Lily on Bree’s arm; Sarah’s quiet awakening.
* **Scene 42 — “Carl” (Sarah POV)**: meet-cute + first dates; Carl as genuinely decent.
* **Scene 43 — “Honest” (Sarah POV)**: Sarah tries, realises it’s not attraction; ends it clean; guilt.
* **Scene 44 — “Not a Blanket” (Sarah POV)**: solo night out → too much drink → sudden illness → calls Lauren → sleeps at Lauren’s → morning realisation.

To get momentum, I can write Scene 41 fully now, then keep going. Here’s Scene 41 👇
