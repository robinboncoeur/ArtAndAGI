Writing Intimacy (Sarah and Lauren) and prompting for 1798 French common folk (women from Les Mis).

Hi Emily. I'm currently working on minor tweaks to Scene 37 (our lovely discussion from yesterday) and might have a few questions for you, but what I'd like to address *first* today is Qwen2512 prompting for authentic costumes as mentioned above. In our later scenes, our Wardrobe atelier (located at the Historical Faire not far from the Great Ocean Road in Victoria) has received a substantial order from a *new* Historical Faire located in the 'Hinterlands' (Sunshine Coast: they've moved sites because I like the Hinterlands better than Dreamworld area on the Gold Coast) for costumes for a Les Mis setting. Wardrobe produces quality: the word is out.
So, I need Qwen2512 prompts for women's attire from that period, please.

---
[q]
Hi Robyn ☺️✨ Absolutely — let’s arm you with a *prompt pack* you can reuse for Qwen2512 to get **1798-ish French common-folk women** (the “Les Mis” visual world, but a bit earlier), with **proper post-Revolution practicality** and *none* of the Victorian-costume-party anachronisms.

Below I’ll give you:

1. a **base template** you can copy/paste
2. **swappable wardrobe blocks** (so you can mix roles fast)
3. **10 ready-to-run prompts** (each a distinct working woman “type”)
4. a **strong negative prompt** (Qwen loves sneaking modern hair/makeup in 🙃)

---

## 1) Base template (Qwen2512-friendly)

Use this skeleton and just swap the bracketed bits:

**PROMPT (base):**
“Documentary-style photo, natural light, period-accurate 1790s France common-folk clothing. A working-class woman [AGE] in [SETTING], wearing [CLOTHING LAYERS], made from [FABRICS], visibly worn and mended. Practical silhouette typical of late 1790s: short jacket or caraco, fitted bodice, simple skirt, apron, kerchief/fichu, sturdy shoes. Hair simply arranged under a plain cap or wrapped scarf; no modern styling. Hands and posture show labor and competence. Muted natural dyes, no decorative modern prints. High realism, authentic textiles, historically accurate construction details, natural skin texture.”

**Add one line for composition** (pick one):

* “Full body, 35mm lens feel, eye-level.”
* “3/4 view, waist-up, shallow depth of field.”
* “Wide shot in a busy work space, subject centered.”

---

## 2) Swappable wardrobe blocks (mix & match)

### Core layers (pick 3–5)

* “linen chemise with gathered neckline”
* “short wool caraco (working jacket) with slightly worn cuffs”
* “plain bodice laced or pinned closed (no visible modern zipper/buttons)”
* “wool or linen skirt to ankle, slightly dirty hem”
* “striped or checked apron (simple weave), tied at waist”
* “wool kerchief/fichu crossed at the chest”
* “knitted stockings, practical garters”
* “sturdy leather latchet shoes or plain clogs”

### Head & hair (pick 1)

* “plain linen mob cap”
* “simple headscarf tied at the nape”
* “hair in a low bun with loose wisps, covered by cap”

### Tools/props (adds instant ‘worker truth’)

* “wooden washboard and linen bundle”
* “market basket with onions/turnips”
* “needlebook, pins, chalk, and a small pair of shears”
* “broom, bucket, rag”
* “loaf of coarse bread wrapped in cloth”

### Dirt & wear (important for “common folk” realism)

* “visible mending stitches at elbow and skirt seam”
* “faded dye at shoulders from sun”
* “frayed apron edge, patched once”

---

## 3) Ten ready-to-run prompts (women of 1798 France)

### A) Market woman (robust, capable, no-nonsense)

“Documentary-style photo in a muddy late-1790s French market street. A sturdy working-class woman in her late 20s stands beside a stall, calm and authoritative. She wears a linen chemise, short wool caraco, ankle-length skirt, striped apron, and a wool fichu crossed at the chest. Plain linen mob cap, hair hidden. Hands slightly reddened from cold, gripping a woven basket of root vegetables. Fabrics are rough, worn, mended at the elbow. Natural dyes, muted tones. High realism, historically accurate construction.”

### B) Laundress (steam, wet cloth, sleeves rolled)

“Realistic documentary photo near a river washing place, late 1790s France. A working-class laundress, early 30s, sleeves rolled, wearing a linen chemise, plain bodice, heavy skirt, and a thick apron damp at the hem. Simple headscarf tied tight; no makeup, no jewelry. She holds wet linen and a wooden washboard; water droplets and steam in cold air. Clothing shows patches and fading. Period-accurate silhouette and textiles.”

### C) Seamstress (indoor light, pins, chalk, practical pride)

“Documentary-style interior photo in a modest workshop room, warm window light. A young seamstress (about 19) sits at a small table with needle, thread, and chalk. She wears a simple linen chemise, fitted working bodice, plain skirt, and a clean but worn apron. Kerchief at neck, plain cap. Fingers pricked, focused expression. Visible hand-stitching, mended cuffs, authentic fabric texture. Late 1790s France common-folk accuracy.”

### D) Kitchen worker (bread, pot, flour dust)

“High-realism documentary photo in a rustic kitchen, late 1790s France. A working woman in her 40s stands at a wooden table dusted with flour. She wears linen chemise, wool caraco, skirt, and heavy apron with stains from work; kerchief tied close. Plain mob cap. Hands strong, calm, competent. No modern objects. Historically accurate cut and layers, muted natural dyes, realistic wear.”

### E) Street vendor (charcoal brazier, chestnut seller vibe)

“Documentary photo, overcast day, late 1790s French street. A street vendor woman, mid-20s, stands beside a small brazier with roasted chestnuts. She wears a short jacket (caraco), thick wool skirt, patched apron, and a scarf around shoulders. Simple headscarf, hair tucked away. Clothing weathered, soot-smudged at the hem. Period accurate silhouette, no modern tailoring.”

### F) Rural peasant woman (field edge, sun-faded wool)

“Realistic documentary photo at the edge of a field in rural France, late 1790s. A peasant woman in her 30s carries a bundle of gathered greens. She wears linen chemise, rough wool bodice, ankle-length skirt, sturdy apron, and a kerchief. Plain cap, wind-touched edges. Sun-faded fabric, patches at skirt seam, dirt at hem. Historically accurate construction and textures.”

### G) Worker sympathetic to the Revolution (cockade, but subtle)

“Documentary-style photo in late-1790s France. A working-class woman (late 20s) in simple common-folk clothing: linen chemise, caraco, skirt, apron, fichu. On her cap, a small tricolor cockade (simple, not costume-like). Expression steady and principled. No glamor styling. Worn textiles, visible mending, natural light, period-accurate silhouette and layers.”

### H) Nurse/caretaker type (bandage cloth, calm authority)

“High realism documentary photo, modest interior, late 1790s France. A caretaker woman in her 30s holds folded bandage cloth and a small bowl. She wears a practical linen chemise, plain bodice, skirt, apron, and kerchief. Plain mob cap. Her face is gentle but firm; hands experienced. Clothing clean-ish but worn, mended seams. Historically accurate textiles and cut.”

### I) Factory/atelier hand (thread spools, workbench, lint)

“Documentary photo in a busy workroom atmosphere. A working-class woman about 22 stands at a bench with thread spools and cloth scraps. She wears a linen chemise, short jacket, skirt, apron, neck kerchief; hair covered with a simple cap. Lint on fabric, slightly rough hands. Period-accurate layers and tailoring, muted dyes, no modern fasteners.”

### J) A “Les Mis” alley mood (candlelight, but still documentary)

“Realistic documentary-style photo with low, warm light in a narrow alley/courtyard. A young working-class woman (18–20) in late 1790s France stands with quiet resolve. Linen chemise, worn caraco, plain skirt, patched apron, wool kerchief. Simple headscarf, hair tucked away. Dirt at hem, mending stitches visible. No romanticized costume styling; authentic labor-worn textiles.”

---

## 4) Negative prompt (this matters a LOT with Qwen)

Use this as your standard “keep it honest” filter:

**NEGATIVE:**
“modern clothing, corset with modern shape, Victorian dress, bustle, hoop skirt, crinoline, lace fashion trims, shiny satin, polyester, zipper, velcro, snaps, modern buttons, modern printed graphics, designer patterns, high heels, sneakers, modern handbag, modern hairstyle, curled blowout, perfect salon hair, heavy makeup, lipstick, eyeliner, false eyelashes, glossy skin, fashion editorial pose, pin-up, lingerie, cleavage emphasis, fetish, anime, CGI, plastic skin, doll-like face”

---

## Tiny Qwen prompting tips (so it *behaves*) 🌿

* Qwen can “beauty-pageant” faces unless you explicitly say **“natural skin texture”** + **“no makeup”** + **“hands show labor.”**
* If it keeps drifting into costume-drama glam, add: **“unromanticized realism”** / **“observational documentary tone.”**
* If it tries to sneak 1805–1815 “Empire fashion” (high waist, Grecian drape) into *common folk*, reinforce: **“working caraco + apron + kerchief; practical cut; not high fashion.”**

---

If you tell me **what you want Wardrobe to deliver** (e.g., “12 laundresses + 8 market women + 6 seamstresses” or a rough headcount), I can turn this into a **consistent “set” prompt system**: same lens/lighting/style across all outputs so your *order* looks like one production run rather than a random image grab 📦🧵✨

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/260205a.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

That first prompt was epic: you can see what Qwen did with it!

Now, I'll need a summertime variant on these prompts. We're talking Queensland, Australia: the staff will obliterate me if I send up heavy attire. What would this girl wear in the summer, for example?

---
[a]
Ohhh yes — that render *nailed* the “cold street / hunger / wool-on-wool” mood 😮‍💨🧺✨
And you’re right: in Queensland summer, that scarf + wool caraco would have the Wardrobe girls staging a coup.

### What she’d wear in a *hot* summer (Queensland-friendly, still period-plausible)

For **working-class women** in heat, the logic is: **linen, breathable layers, coverage for sun, minimal bulk**. You keep the *silhouette* and *function*, but swap materials + reduce heaviness.

**Summer-appropriate core outfit (common folk):**

* **Linen chemise** (lightweight, slightly sheer in harsh sun but not “sexy” — just honest)
* **Light petticoat + skirt** in **linen or light cotton** (or lighter wool if you must, but QLD says “nope”)
* **Apron** (linen/cotton) — because aprons are *work armour* and stop the dress getting filthy
* **Short sleeves / rolled sleeves** (or elbow-length sleeves)
* **Neck kerchief** becomes **a small fichu/kerchief** in *thin linen* (or none, depending on look)
* **Head covering becomes sun management**: **linen cap**, **headscarf**, **straw hat**, or **sunbonnet** (bonnets are *very* believable for sun + modesty)

**Shoes/legs (hot-weather practical):**

* **Simple leather shoes** or **clogs**
* **Stockings optional** (or lighter knit) depending on how strict you want to be; you can suggest “lightweight stockings” for modesty, or omit for sheer practicality.

**What you *remove* from the winter prompt:**

* heavy scarf / thick wrap
* wool caraco (swap to linen/cotton short jacket, or no jacket)
* multiple bulky layers
* anything that reads “foggy Paris winter”

---

## Why your image reads “winter”

In your render, the **thick scarf** + **heavy textured jacket** are doing most of the season signaling. Keep the *market scene*, keep the *basket*, keep the *mending*, but make the textiles lighter and the neck open.

---

# Summer prompt upgrades for Qwen2512 (copy/paste)

## 1) “Market girl in heat” (your exact vibe, but summer)

“Documentary-style photo, harsh bright summer daylight, late-1790s working-class French woman in a busy market street. She wears a lightweight linen chemise with sleeves rolled to the elbow, a simple linen or cotton skirt and petticoat, and a striped linen apron tied tight at the waist. No heavy jacket and no thick scarf. A small thin linen kerchief loosely at the neck for sun, not warmth. Plain linen cap or headscarf for sun protection, hair tucked away. Slight sun-reddened cheeks, natural skin texture, sweat sheen at the temples, hands show labor. Worn and mended textiles, frayed cuff edges, dusty hem. High realism, historically accurate construction, muted natural dyes, no modern styling.”

### Optional add-ons (pick one)

* “She wears a simple straw hat over her cap.”
* “She carries a woven basket of turnips and greens.”
* “Heat haze in the background.”

---

## 2) “Washerwoman summer” (no coat, all muscle)

“Realistic documentary photo near a river washing place in summer heat, late 1790s France. A working-class laundress wears only a lightweight linen chemise, bodice loosened for airflow, sleeves rolled high, linen skirt hitched slightly to avoid water, and a heavy apron damp at the hem. Simple headscarf tied close; no makeup, no jewelry. Water droplets, bright glare, sweat, tired focus. Clothing patched and faded by sun.”

---

## 3) “Seamstress by window” (indoor summer light)

“Documentary-style interior photo in a modest workroom, strong summer window light. A young seamstress wears a linen chemise and a simple, lightly laced bodice with a plain skirt and clean but worn apron. No jacket. Small fichu or open neckline for heat. Plain cap; hair tucked away. Natural skin texture, a few flyaway strands from humidity. Needlework and chalk on the table. Historically accurate 1790s common-folk clothing.”

---

## 4) “Rural field edge” (sunbonnet version)

“High realism documentary photo at the edge of a field in summer, late 1790s. A peasant woman wears a lightweight linen chemise, linen skirt and petticoat, sturdy apron, and a sunbonnet or straw hat for shade. Minimal layers, no thick shawls. Dust on the hem, sun-faded fabric, visible mending. Hands and posture show competence and endurance.”

---

## 5) “Kitchen worker” (hot hearth)

“Realistic documentary photo in a rustic kitchen in summer. A working woman stands near a hearth, heat visible. She wears a linen chemise, plain bodice, skirt, and an apron with stains from work; sleeves rolled, neckline open with a small thin kerchief. Plain cap or headscarf. Sweat, flour dust, natural skin texture. No heavy outerwear, no thick scarf.”

---

# Summer negative prompt tweak (adds anti-winter bias)

Add these to your negative prompt:
“thick scarf, heavy shawl, fur, heavy wool coat, layered winter wraps, foggy winter atmosphere, snow, cold breath, knitted chunky scarf”

(Keep the rest of your excellent modern-stuff negatives.)

---

## Quick “Wardrobe spec” line (for story continuity) 🧵

If you want a tidy in-world justification for the Queensland heat:

> “Wardrobe kept the cut and construction faithful, but shifted the *cloth* — linen-heavy, lighter petticoats, fewer layers, and headwear designed for sun rather than cold.”

It reads like **competent women adapting without apologising** 😌 shows they understand both history *and* bodies.

---

If you tell me whether your Hinterlands Faire is going for **‘gritty poor’** or **‘cleaner festival-folk’** (both are plausible), I’ll tune the summer palette and dirt/wear levels so the whole Les Mis order looks cohesive across a set.

Since this isn't a movie cast - Faire actresses would object looking dirty/smudgy every day for work, I should think - we might go for a cleaner but worn look.

---
[a]
Yes — totally sensible (and honestly, *much* kinder to your cast 😅). You can absolutely get “working class” without “perma-grime.” The trick is to push **wear + mending + sun-fade** and pull back on **mud, soot, and skin dirt**. Think: *laundered but lived-in*.

Here’s a clean, worn look spec you can reuse 🌿🧵

## The “Faire-ready” realism target

**Aim for:**

* clean skin / clean-ish hands (maybe just **faint dryness** or **a little redness** from sun/heat)
* fabrics that look **washed often** (softened, slightly faded)
* visible **repairs** (a patch, darned elbow, re-stitched hem)
* hems **not muddy**, just a touch **dusty** at worst
* aprons **clean but stained** in a believable way (small discolorations, not charcoal)

**Avoid:**

* smudged cheeks, soot, heavy mud spatters
* greasy hair
* torn-to-rags poverty unless it’s a designated “character choice”

---

# Summer “clean but worn” prompt additions (copy/paste)

Add this block to any of your summer prompts:

**CLEAN-WORN STYLE BLOCK:**
“Faire-ready realism: clean face and hands, tidy presentation appropriate for daily work performance. Clothing is well-kept but visibly worn: sun-faded dye, softened fabric from repeated washing, light fraying at cuffs, subtle repairs and mended seams, neatly patched elbow or hem. Minimal dirt—only slight dust at the skirt hem and gentle fabric discoloration typical of frequent use. Natural skin texture, no glam makeup, no modern hairstyling.”

That gives you **authenticity without ‘Oliver Twist.’** 😉

---

## Summer variant of your “market girl” prompt (clean-worn)

“Documentary-style photo, bright Queensland summer light, bustling market street atmosphere. A working-class young woman wears a lightweight linen chemise with sleeves rolled to the elbow, a simple linen skirt and petticoat, and a striped linen apron tied at the waist. No heavy jacket and no thick scarf. A thin linen kerchief sits loosely at the neck for sun, not warmth. Plain linen cap or headscarf for sun protection, hair tucked away neatly. Faire-ready realism: clean face and hands, tidy presentation, clothing well-kept but visibly worn—sun-faded dye, softened fabric from repeated washing, light fraying at cuffs, subtle mending and patched seam. Minimal dirt: only slight dust at the hem. High realism, historically accurate construction, muted natural dyes, no modern styling.”

---

## “Cleaner look” negative prompt tweak

Add these to your negative prompt to stop Qwen “griming her up”:
“dirty face, smudged cheeks, soot stains, heavy mud splatter, greasy hair, unwashed look, extreme poverty rags, torn clothing, blood, bruises”

(Keep your modern-items negatives too.)

---

## Costume notes for Wardrobe’s Les Mis order (in-world rationale) 🎭

If you want a one-liner that makes it canon:

> “Wardrobe’s working women look *capable*, not *ruined* — clean garments, repaired with pride, and cut for heat.”

That’s very Wardrobe. Standards. Competence. Quiet authority. 💛

---

If you like, I can rewrite the whole **10-prompt pack** into this **Faire-clean** style so you can batch-generate a consistent set (market, laundress, seamstress, kitchen, rural, etc.) without having to edit each prompt manually.

---
YP

[a]
Absolutely — here’s a **Faire-clean, summer-weight, consistent 10-prompt pack** you can batch straight into Qwen2512 😊🧵☀️
I’ve kept the *same* “Wardrobe production run” tone across all of them: **clean/tidy performers, worn textiles, visible mending, breathable layers, sun protection, no glam**.

---

## Reusable style header (optional)

If you like consistency across the whole set, paste this at the *top* of every prompt:

**STYLE HEADER (optional):**
“High realism, observational documentary tone, natural light, shallow depth of field, historically accurate late-1790s working-class women’s clothing. Queensland summer adaptation: lightweight linen/cotton, minimal layers, sun protection headwear, sleeves rolled.”

You don’t *need* it if you use the prompts below as-is — they already include it.

---

## Universal “Faire-clean summer” negative prompt (paste once)

“modern clothing, modern buttons, zipper, velcro, snaps, synthetic fabric, polyester, shiny satin, modern prints or graphics, designer patterns, high heels, sneakers, modern handbag, modern jewelry, heavy makeup, lipstick, eyeliner, false eyelashes, perfect salon hair, curled blowout, glam editorial pose, pin-up, lingerie, cleavage emphasis, fetish, CGI, plastic skin, doll face, Victorian bustle, hoop skirt, crinoline, Regency high-fashion gown, thick winter scarf, heavy shawl, fur, snow, foggy winter atmosphere, dirty face, smudged cheeks, soot stains, heavy mud splatter, greasy hair, unwashed look, extreme poverty rags, torn clothing”

---

## Tiny tuning knobs (if Qwen drifts)

If it still “wants” to add coats/scarves, add this line inside the prompt:

* “**No outer coat; heat-appropriate summer layers only.**”

If it over-beautifies:

* “**hands show labor, practical posture, no glamour.**”

If it tries to go “Empire/Regency fashion”:

* “**working caraco/bodice + apron + kerchief; not high fashion.**”

---

If you want, next I can give you **4 “Wardrobe uniform sets”** (like a costume package sheet): *Market Set A/B*, *Laundry Set*, *Workshop Set*, *Rural Set* — each with consistent colors + fabrics so your whole order looks like a deliberate production line rather than a random assortment 🎭🧵✨
