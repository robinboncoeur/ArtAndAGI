## **Scene 41 — “Radiant” (Sarah POV)**

Wardrobe gets a particular kind of busy when the Faire women come in.

It’s not the everyday rhythm—steam and pins and Mara’s shears making their soft, confident threats. It’s something more theatrical: colour arriving, laughter arriving, the faint perfume of other lives. Actresses bring a kind of light with them. Not always pleasant, but undeniable.

They came in after lunch, a cluster of them, skirts and tote bags and big opinions. The room tightened into competence automatically: stations ready, fittings scheduled, tape measures uncoiled like quiet authority.

I was on my stool with a coffee, watching the threshold the way I always did—half habit, half sport—when Bree walked in with someone on her arm.

Not literally. Bree’s not a Victorian gentleman. But the posture was the same: the subtle lean toward, the easy angle of her shoulder, the way her body said *this person belongs with me* without needing to announce it.

Lily.

I’d seen Lily before. Everyone had. Lily was one of those women who made a room adjust itself—hair like a promise, laugh like she’d never once asked permission to take up space. She’d always been charming in a way that made me roll my eyes because I don’t trust charming.

But today she wasn’t performing.

Today she was… *lit.*

She walked in beside Bree and the two of them had that private, bright current running between them—little glances, tiny touches, the kind of unforced coordination you only get when two people have stopped negotiating whether they’re allowed to want each other.

Bree’s grin was wide and unashamed.

Lily’s hand brushed Bree’s wrist as they crossed the room, not coy, not possessive. Just… natural. Like reaching for warmth.

And it hit me—harder than I expected—that they looked happy.

Not “posting online” happy.

Not “prove something” happy.

Happy like a body that has stopped bracing.

I watched them as they moved toward the fitting area. Bree said something under her breath and Lily laughed—real laughter, head tipping back, eyes closing for half a beat. Bree’s face softened in response, like her whole nervous system had learned the shape of that sound.

I felt a strange, unwelcome thought rise up in me:

*That looks… nice.*

Then another one, even worse, because it arrived with zero moral framing and no permission slip from my brain:

*And she’s beautiful.*

I didn’t mean it as competition. I didn’t mean it as envy. I meant it as a fact my eyes observed, the way my eyes observe fabric quality.

Lily was objectively gorgeous.

But that wasn’t what made my stomach tilt.

It was the way Bree looked at her like she was the only thing in the room worth orienting toward.

Bree — who could be loud, chaotic, generous, irritating, wonderful — looked *quietly devoted.*

It wasn’t a joke. It wasn’t a phase. It wasn’t a “girls being silly” interlude before returning to a man-shaped life.

It was… real.

I swallowed and made myself take a sip of coffee, because I needed my hands to do something that wasn’t betraying me.

Lily spotted Charli at the cap table and waved.

“Oh my god,” she called, delighted. “Look at you! You’re… you’re so *proper* now.”

Charli flushed, smiling in that bashful way she still had even with all her new steadiness.

“Hi,” Charli said, and didn’t apologise for the attention. Didn’t duck. Didn’t shrink.

She took the compliment like a girl who had learned she didn’t have to throw gifts back into people’s faces for safety.

Celeste glanced up from the ledger, calm as ever, and nodded once at Lily—polite, controlled, adult.

Then her gaze flicked to Charli for half a beat, and I caught it: the softness she tried so hard to hide.

Wardrobe saw everything. Even when people pretended it didn’t.

Mara clapped her hands once—sharp, decisive.

“Right,” she said. “You. Fitting room. You. Table. Stop talking and start standing still.”

The actresses laughed and obeyed, because Mara was the closest thing this room had to gravity.

Lily stepped closer to Bree and said, low but not private enough for my sharp ears not to catch it:

“You’re coming over tonight, yeah?”

Bree’s grin went lazy and warm. “Obviously.”

No apology. No awkwardness. No “if you want.” No “unless you’re busy.” No negotiation.

Just yes.

And in my chest, something shifted.

Not jealousy.

Not longing, not yet.

Something more uncomfortable:

recognition.

A kind of internal data point landing with a quiet thud: *that’s what it looks like when the wanting isn’t a problem.*

When the wanting isn’t shameful.

When the wanting doesn’t turn you into someone’s domestic function.

When it’s just… two women, deciding.

I sat there on my stool, coffee cooling, and watched Bree and Lily disappear into the fitting area together—Bree stepping aside to hold the curtain, Lily’s hand brushing her shoulder as she passed—and I realised, with faint annoyance, that I’d been holding my breath.

I let it out slowly.

Then I did what I always did when something hit too close:

I made it a joke in my own head.

*Well,* I thought, dryly, *that’s inconvenient.*

Because once you’ve seen a kind of happiness up close—real, radiant, unforced—it becomes very difficult to pretend you don’t know what you’re missing.

---

If you want, I’ll write **Scene 42 (“Carl”)** next — and I’ll make Carl genuinely likeable, respectful, emotionally literate… and still wrong for her, in a way that hurts *because* he’s decent. That’s the exact antidote to the trope you’re worried about. 💛

## **Scene 42 — “Carl” (Sarah POV)**

The annoying thing about having a small awakening is that the world doesn’t stop to let you process it.

Bree and Lily glow their way through Wardrobe like a private weather system, and then the next minute you’re back to pinning hems and pretending you didn’t just witness a version of happiness that made your stomach do a weird, traitorous little flip.

I tried to file it under **Not My Problem**.

It didn’t stay filed.

For the rest of the week, I kept catching myself watching them—tiny touches, shared looks, that relaxed certainty between them. Not performative. Not defensive. Not asking permission.

Just… two women who were done negotiating whether their wanting was valid.

Every time I noticed it, I felt the same thought arrive, uninvited, like a notification you can’t swipe away:

*That looks nice.*

Which was a ridiculous thing to think, because I was in the middle of the Ethan aftermath and my nervous system still had that “every door might have a man behind it” edge.

So, naturally, the universe offered me a man who was… fine.

Not “fine” as in attractive. Fine as in: not a walking hazard. Not an entitled toddler in an adult body. Not a replacement-mum seeker.

Fine as in: decent.

His name was Carl.

I met him on a Thursday in a way so ordinary it almost felt staged.

The Faire had sent someone to check on the lighting in the small dressing corridor—the one that always flickered when the iron was on, the one Mara had been muttering about for days like it was a personal insult. We’d been told “an electrician” was coming. Which, in my experience, can mean anything from “competent professional” to “man who explains wires to women as if we’re newborn calves.”

Carl walked in carrying a tool bag and a clipboard and the sort of calm that doesn’t feel like a performance.

He paused at the threshold—not swaggering, not barging—and looked around like he was assessing the room the way you assess a dog: with respect.

“Hi,” he said. “I’m Carl. I’m here for the corridor lights.”

Lauren looked up. “Great. Thank you. It’s that corridor—second door on the right.”

Carl nodded. “No worries. Is anyone using it right now?”

The sentence was so innocuous that it took my brain a second to recognise why it felt… notable.

He’d asked.

He hadn’t assumed the space was his because he had tools.

Lauren pointed. “We can reroute for ten minutes.”

“Perfect,” Carl said, and he smiled in a polite, non-invasive way. “I’ll be quick.”

He didn’t look at anyone’s body.

He didn’t linger.

He didn’t do the thing where men scan a room to see who might be impressed by them.

He went to the corridor and started working.

I found myself watching him, purely out of suspicion. Suspicion is my love language, unfortunately.

Carl pulled the panel off, tested something, frowned—not dramatically, just thoughtfully.

Then he called back into the room, voice normal.

“Hey—who’s been running the iron off this circuit?”

Mara didn’t look up. “We run everything off everything. Fix it.”

Carl chuckled once—one of those quick, genuine laughs—and said, “Right. Okay. I’ll reroute. Give me five.”

Mara grunted, which for Mara is basically a poem.

Ten minutes later the corridor lights were steady. No flicker. No drama.

Carl came back into the room, wiped his hands on a rag, and said to Lauren, “All done. I moved the iron load off the corridor. Should be stable now.”

Lauren nodded. “Thank you.”

Carl hesitated, then added, “If it flickers again, text the number on the work order. Don’t wait. It’s easier to fix early.”

Again: *he asked*, *he explained*, *he gave a solution*, and then he stopped talking.

It was… disconcerting.

As he turned to leave, his gaze met mine for half a second. Not lingering. Not hungry. Just human.

He gave a small nod.

I nodded back, because I am not feral either.

And then he said, as if he’d debated it and decided not to be weird:

“Sorry—are you Sarah?”

I froze, instantly.

Men knowing my name without me giving it to them is a known trigger. A small one. But real.

Carl clocked my stillness immediately.

He lifted his hands slightly, palms open—not theatrical, just reflexively reassuring.

“Bree mentioned you,” he said. “Only because I asked who handles the staff passes. She said you’re the one who knows where everything is.”

Ah. Bree. Of course.

I exhaled slowly, annoyed at my own body for being so quick to brace.

“What did she tell you,” I said, dry.

Carl’s mouth twitched. “That you’re terrifying,” he said, equally dry. “And that if I needed anything, I should ask politely and leave you alone.”

I snorted—an actual, involuntary sound—and felt, irritatingly, my shoulders loosen.

“Well,” I said, “Bree’s not wrong.”

Carl nodded like he’d just received a useful manual. “Good to know.”

Then he did something genuinely rare.

He didn’t push.

He didn’t use that opening to wedge himself into my day.

He simply added, “Anyway. Nice to meet you. I’ll get out of your way.”

And he left.

No lingering. No “maybe I’ll see you around.” No invitation snuck in under a joke.

Just… gone.

I stared after him for a moment, unsettled.

Bree appeared beside me like a cat, grin already loaded.

“You’re welcome,” she said.

I glared. “For what.”

“For Carl,” Bree said, smug. “He’s a nice bloke. I pre-approved him.”

“You don’t get to pre-approve men,” I said.

Bree shrugged. “I do when they’re harmless.”

“Harmless men are a myth,” I muttered.

Bree leaned closer, conspiratorial. “He bakes.”

I turned slowly. “That’s not a personality.”

“It’s a domestic competency,” Bree corrected. “Which, apparently, is your love language now.”

I rolled my eyes so hard I nearly saw my own brain.

“Stop trying to set me up,” I said.

Bree’s grin widened. “I’m not. He asked about you. I answered. If he asks you out, that’s on him.”

“I am not a charity,” I said.

Bree held up a hand. “Agreed. Which is why he’s the only man I know who might survive your standards.”

I wanted to argue.

But the irritating part was: I didn’t feel a need to.

That evening, as I was locking up my car, my phone buzzed.

Unknown number.

I almost didn’t answer. Then the text came through first.

> **Carl:** Hi Sarah—Carl here (electrician from today). Bree gave me your number *only if* I promised not to be a pest.
> If you’d ever like a coffee, I’d enjoy that. No pressure either way.

I stared at it.

The “no pressure” could have been a tactic.

But it didn’t read like a tactic.

It read like a man who understood that pressure is exactly how you lose a woman like me.

I typed. Deleted. Typed again.

I could feel my own resistance rising, automatic and familiar.

A man wants something. Therefore I must prepare for him to take it.

Except… that’s not what this was.

This was an invitation with an exit built in.

Which is, frankly, a rare competence.

I found myself thinking of Bree and Lily—radiant and unashamed—and the way their wanting didn’t come with a hidden invoice.

Then I thought of Ethan, and how quickly wanting had turned into entitlement.

And then I realised: the real question wasn’t “is Carl safe?”

It was:

*Am I even interested?*

I didn’t know.

Which annoyed me, because I like knowing.

Still, there was another truth sitting underneath my irritation:

I wanted to see what it felt like to be around a man who didn’t make my boundary management a full-time job.

So I replied, short and clear.

> **Me:** Coffee is fine. One hour. Public. Saturday afternoon.
> If you’re late, I leave.

The reply came quickly.

> **Carl:** Perfect. Saturday. I’ll be early.
> And thank you.

I blinked.

Thank you?

Not for agreeing. Not for giving him a chance.

Thank you for being clear.

I stared at the screen for a moment, then put my phone away and locked my car.

As I walked toward my building, I felt… cautious.

Not hopeful. Not giddy.

But cautiously curious.

And that, for me, was almost romantic.

[Q]

## **Scene 43 — “Saturday” (Sarah POV)**

Saturday happened the way I prefer things to happen:

in daylight.

In public.

With exits.

I chose the café, obviously. Neutral territory. Big windows. Plenty of foot traffic. A place where the tables are close enough that a man has to behave like a civilised mammal or everyone hears it.

I arrived five minutes early because I’m not going to be the woman who gets there and starts scanning the room like prey.

Carl was already there.

Of course he was.

He stood when he saw me—not dramatically, not “gentlemanly,” just polite—and offered a small smile that didn’t try to claim anything.

“Hi,” he said.

“Hi,” I replied.

He didn’t lean in for a hug. He didn’t touch my arm. He didn’t do the thing where men treat greeting as a test of access.

He just… existed at a respectful distance.

It was, frankly, unnerving.

We ordered coffee at the counter. He paid for his. I paid for mine. He didn’t argue about it.

That alone probably qualified him for sainthood.

We sat at a table by the window.

Carl asked, “Is this seat okay?” before he sat down.

I stared at him for half a beat.

“Yes,” I said. “You can sit. I’m not a queen.”

He smiled, faint. “Good. I didn’t want to guess wrong.”

That phrase—guess wrong—landed with a quiet thud.

Men usually guess. They guess because they assume it’s safer for them to risk your discomfort than risk their pride.

Carl was not guessing.

He was checking.

I took a sip of coffee and told myself not to be impressed by basic decency. The bar is on the floor. We should not be applauding men for stepping over it.

Still.

It was… a relief.

We talked.

Not the interview kind of talking, where a man tries to discover which version of himself you’d like and then shapeshifts accordingly.

Actual talking.

He told me he did electrical work for the Faire and a few local businesses. He liked fixing old things. He’d moved back to town after his dad got sick. He baked because it was cheaper than buying food and because it stopped his brain spinning at night.

I listened, alert for the hidden tells.

There weren’t many.

He didn’t complain about women. He didn’t complain about his ex. He didn’t imply he was “nice” in a way that made you brace for the invoice.

He asked questions that didn’t feel like fishing.

“What do you do when you’re not here?”
“Do you like living in town?”
“Do you have siblings?”

Normal.

I answered enough to be polite, but not so much that I’d be handing him my internal wiring diagram.

It was… okay.

More than okay, technically.

The problem was not Carl.

The problem was me.

Because halfway through the coffee, with the sun bright through the windows and his hands wrapped around his mug—steady, clean, capable—I realised something with a clarity that made me want to swear.

I didn’t want him.

Not in the sense that matters.

Not in the gut. Not in the chest. Not in the place that tilts you toward someone without negotiation.

I liked him.

I respected him.

I could even imagine being friends with him, which is the cruelest category of all.

But the part of me that had watched Bree and Lily glow didn’t wake up.

It stayed asleep, stubborn, unmoved.

Carl said something—some gentle joke about the Faire lights being “temperamental divas”—and I laughed genuinely.

Then my laugh stopped and I thought, sharply:

*If he leaned across the table and kissed me right now, I would tolerate it like a dentist appointment.*

That was my answer.

My phone buzzed with a message. Bree.

> **Bree:** HOW IS IT
> Blink twice if you need rescuing

I stared at it for a second, then typed back:

> **Me:** No rescue. He’s fine. I’m the problem.

I didn’t send the second part. I deleted it and sent:

> **Me:** He’s on time. No red flags. Shut up.

Carl watched my face in that unobtrusive way decent people do.

“Everything okay?” he asked.

“Yes,” I said automatically.

Then, because he’d earned it by behaving like a grown man, I added: “You’re… surprisingly normal.”

Carl’s mouth twitched. “That’s either a compliment or a warning.”

“It’s both,” I said.

He laughed, and it was warm, uncomplicated.

He didn’t reach for me.

He didn’t fill the pause.

He let the conversation breathe.

That’s what made it worse.

Because it was harder to justify leaving.

When a man is awful, ending it is easy. It’s a clean moral decision.

When a man is decent, ending it feels like you’re throwing away something you’re *supposed* to want.

Carl checked his watch—brief, polite.

“I’ve got about twenty minutes before I have to go,” he said. “No rush, but I wanted to be upfront.”

Upfront.

Another competence.

I felt my irritation spike—not at him, at the world.

At the way I’d been trained to interpret “decent” as “good enough.”

At the way women are expected to accept a kind man like he’s a prize, regardless of whether their bodies agree.

Carl watched me for a moment, thoughtful.

“Can I ask you something?” he said.

“Depends,” I replied.

He nodded, accepting the boundary like it was normal.

“You seem… tense,” he said carefully. “Not because I’m here. Just—generally. If this is too much, you can tell me. I’m not trying to push.”

It was such a reasonable sentence that it made my throat tighten.

I had a choice right then.

Lie, keep it going, let it drift into something that would eventually become messy.

Or be honest early, before I’d created obligations.

I didn’t want to hurt him.

But I hated the idea of using his decency as a place to hide while I figured myself out.

So I said the truth I actually had.

“I’m not sure what I want,” I said, and kept my voice steady. “And I’m not going to make that your problem.”

Carl’s expression shifted—small, controlled. He didn’t flinch, but I saw the sting land anyway.

He nodded slowly.

“Okay,” he said. “Thank you for saying it.”

I blinked.

Of course he thanked me.

Decent men thank you for honesty even when it hurts.

Which makes you feel like a villain anyway.

“I’m not saying ‘never,’” I added quickly, because guilt is stupid and fast.

Carl’s eyes met mine.

His voice stayed gentle. “Sarah,” he said, “don’t offer me a maybe because you feel bad.”

I stared at him.

He gave a small shrug.

“I’d rather you say no,” he continued, “than say yes out of obligation. I don’t want to be the kind of man you tolerate.”

There was a quiet dignity in that sentence that made my chest ache.

And in that ache, I felt something else—something clarifying.

It wasn’t fear of repeat performance.

It wasn’t trauma.

It wasn’t “men are bad.”

It was simpler.

I just… wasn’t attracted to him.

Which meant the kindest thing I could do was to stop pretending it might change.

I exhaled.

“Okay,” I said, and forced myself to make it clean. “Then… no.”

Carl’s face tightened for a fraction. He swallowed. Then he nodded, once.

“Okay,” he said. “That’s clear. Thank you.”

He stood, picked up his mug, and took it to the counter like a man who had practiced not making women responsible for his feelings.

When he came back, he didn’t linger.

“I’m glad I met you,” he said. “Even if it’s not… that.”

I held his gaze. “You’re a good man,” I said. “That’s not nothing.”

Carl’s smile was faint and sad.

“I know,” he said quietly. “And it still stings.”

Honesty. Again.

Then he nodded once—no attempt at a hug, no touch, no lingering—and walked out into the sunlight.

I watched him go, throat tight, coffee cold in front of me.

I should have felt relieved.

Instead I felt… guilty.

Because I could tell I’d hurt him.

Not because he’d done anything wrong.

Because decency doesn’t protect you from rejection.

I sat there another minute, staring at my reflection in the café window, and thought, with grim, reluctant clarity:

*Well. That settles that.*

Then my phone buzzed again. Bree.

> **Bree:** DID HE TRY TO KISS YOU
> I will bite him

I stared at it.

And to my own surprise, I laughed.

A real laugh.

Then I typed back:

> **Me:** He didn’t touch me once.
> He’s decent.
> I’m… not into it.

I sent it.

And as I walked out into the daylight, guilt riding my shoulders like a stupid animal, I realised the worst part wasn’t rejecting a good man.

The worst part was that rejecting him had made the other truth harder to ignore:

Whatever I wanted, it wasn’t him.

And the shape of that “not him” was starting to look suspiciously like… her.

I don't know if this is too trope-ish, but we could possibly have Sarah do a bit of introspection. She'd had a crush on a girl in high school: unrequited 'love', not returned, thus Sarah shoved that emotional part of her into the back of the closet with the ski gear. And now, very inconveniently, have it re-emerge at *exactly* the wrong time, when she ended up turning away an actual nice man. 

And so, to drink. and the saga continues as we planned.

---

Not too trope-ish at all — it’s actually one of the *cleanest* ways to make Sarah’s arc feel psychologically inevitable rather than “sudden sexuality plot.” 💛

What makes it *not* tropey is how you’re framing it:

* It’s not “Sarah discovers she’s gay because a man was mean.”
* It’s “Sarah finally admits an old truth because she just met a man who behaved well — and the absence of danger removed her excuses.”

That’s sharp, adult, and very Wardrobe-aligned: **truth emerges when the room becomes safe enough.**

Also: the high-school crush being unreturned is perfect, because it explains why she packed it away without melodrama. The ski-gear metaphor is so Sarah it hurts. 😌

If you like, we can stitch this introspection into the end of Scene 43 or make it the opening of Scene 44. I’d do it as a short **bridge beat**: Sarah alone after the café, guilt humming, memory unspooling, then the choice to go out for a drink.

Here’s that bridge beat in Sarah’s voice:

---

## **Bridge — “Ski Gear” (Sarah POV)**

I didn’t go straight home after Carl.

I walked for a while, because walking keeps me from doing something stupid. It gives my brain time to catch up with my body.

It wasn’t even that he was attractive. He was—fine. He was clean. He was competent. He didn’t touch me. He didn’t push. He didn’t make my boundaries his personal enemy.

He was the kind of man you’re meant to feel grateful for.

And that was the problem.

Because I wasn’t grateful.

I was just… blank.

Like my nervous system had looked at him and said, *Nope. Not you.* And then refused to provide further details.

I kept thinking: maybe it’s fear. Maybe it’s Ethan residue. Maybe it’s just my brain being dramatic because it doesn’t know how to be normal.

But fear doesn’t feel like blankness.

Fear feels like vigilance. Tight shoulders. Exit planning.

What I felt with Carl wasn’t fear.

It was absence.

Which is when the memory hit me, sideways, as if my brain had been waiting for the exact wrong moment to pull it off a shelf.

Year ten. Assembly hall. A girl with dark hair and quick hands and a laugh that made my chest do something embarrassing. I’d watched her for months the way you watch fire, pretending it was curiosity and not the stupid, soft thing under it.

I’d never told her. Not properly. I’d tried once, badly. A clumsy confession disguised as a joke.

She’d smiled—kind, puzzled—and said something like, “Aw, you’re sweet.”

And then she’d gone back to her friends.

No cruelty. No scandal.

Just… not returned.

It had been enough.

Enough to teach me that wanting like that was pointless. Risky. Public.

So I’d packed it away like you pack away ski gear in a town that doesn’t snow: shoved to the back of the closet, forgotten on purpose, mildly embarrassing when you rediscover it.

I hadn’t thought about her in years.

Not properly.

But now—now, after sitting across from a good man and feeling nothing—I could feel that old crush as clearly as if it had happened last week.

The heat. The pull. The stupid, traitorous eagerness.

Not for him.

For her.

For *girls.*

I stopped walking and stood on the footpath, suddenly furious.

Not at the girl from year ten.

At myself.

At the way I’d treated that part of me like a hobby I’d outgrown rather than a truth I’d postponed.

At the way the world makes it so easy to interpret “unrequited” as “wrong.”

I took a breath, sharp and cold, and felt the inconvenience of it settle in my ribs.

So that was it.

Not men.

Not trauma.

Not “I can’t do relationships.”

Just… that.

A buried part of me, choosing the most inconvenient moment to knock.

And because I’m Sarah—because I’m excellent at many things and awful at being gentle with myself—I did what I always do when something tender reappears unexpectedly.

I tried to drown it.

---

If you want, I can now continue directly into **Scene 44** (the drink, the solo night out, the sudden illness, the panic call to Lauren, the night at Lauren’s, and the morning realisation—*not a blanket*). I’ll keep the spiking moment handled exactly as we discussed: sensory, uncertain, no procedural detour, full focus on Sarah’s fear + Lauren’s competent care. 💛

## **Scene 44 — “Not a Blanket” (Sarah POV)**

I told myself I was going out for a drink because I deserved one.

Because I’d done the adult thing with Carl. Because I’d been honest. Because I hadn’t caved to guilt or panic or habit.

All true.

Also, because I’d just opened the back of my own mental closet and found a teenage crush still sitting there, perfectly preserved, like ski gear with the tags still on.

I didn’t want to think about it.

So I chose the oldest strategy in the book: blunt the edges.

I went out alone, which is something I almost never do now, because I am not a romantic and I am not daft.

But I wasn’t looking for romance.

I was looking for noise. For anonymity. For the comforting blur of strangers who didn’t know my history or my rules.

I picked a bar that wasn’t *my* bar.

A place with warm lighting and too much bass and stools that stuck to the backs of your thighs when you stood up. A place where people came to forget themselves in public, together.

I ordered a drink and watched the bartender make it. I’m not stupid.

I took it to a table near the wall, back against something solid, because old habits are not the enemy—they’re a form of intelligence.

For the first half hour, it worked.

The drink eased the tightness in my chest. The noise kept my brain from spiralling. I scrolled my phone and pretended I was just waiting for a friend.

No one bothered me.

I should have left then.

I didn’t.

Because when you’ve spent your whole life being competent, it feels obscene to admit that you’re rattled by a memory from Year Ten. It feels weak to say: *I think I might want something different from my life.*

So I ordered another.

Still watching. Still careful. Still “fine.”

I told myself I’d go after that one. I even stood up once, like I meant it.

Then someone bumped into my table and apologised, and I sat back down because the apology made the world feel briefly civil again.

Another drink.

I was still coherent. Still upright. Still me.

And then… it happened.

Not dramatically. Not like the movies.

Just a wrongness—sudden and unmistakable—like my body had stepped on a stair that wasn’t there.

My stomach rolled. The room tilted, not pleasantly. My skin went hot and then cold, as if someone was adjusting my temperature with a remote. My tongue felt thick. My hands stopped feeling like mine.

I blinked hard. Once. Twice.

*No,* my brain said, sharp and furious. *No, no, no.*

I looked down at my glass.

Half-full. Nothing obvious. Nothing to point to and say *that*.

I tried to stand and my legs said, *absolutely not.*

Panic rose in me—fast, animal.

Not shame.

Not sadness.

Pure survival.

I grabbed my phone and fumbled it once, twice, before it unlocked.

The screen swam.

I could have called the police.

I could have called Bree.

I could have called… anyone.

But the only thought that mattered was this:

*Call the woman who does not ask questions first.*

Lauren.

My thumb hit her name. The phone went to my ear. The ringing sounded far away.

Then her voice, immediate, clear.

“Sarah?”

Something in my chest cracked with relief so sharp it almost hurt.

“Lauren,” I managed. My voice sounded wrong to my own ears—too careful, too slow. “I—I’m not right.”

Lauren didn’t panic. She didn’t do the “what did you do?” tone.

“Where are you?” she asked, calm as a seatbelt.

I forced the address out. I had to look at the menu board behind the bar to read the street name because my brain couldn’t hold it.

“Okay,” Lauren said. “Listen to me. Are you with anyone?”

“No.”

“Can you get outside?”

I glanced toward the door. It looked miles away.

“I—I think so.”

“Good,” she said. “Stand up slowly. Don’t finish your drink. Take your phone and your bag. Go straight out the front. Sit where you can be seen. I’m coming.”

“Okay,” I whispered.

“Sarah,” Lauren said, and her voice sharpened just enough to cut through the fog, “you’re doing brilliantly. Keep breathing. I’ll be there in minutes.”

Minutes.

It sounded like a lifetime.

I stood up carefully, one hand gripping the table until my knuckles went white. The room swayed. I waited until it settled.

I left the glass exactly where it was, because something in me—some last shred of angry competence—wanted it left behind like evidence, even if I didn’t know what I’d prove.

I moved toward the door.

Someone brushed past me and I flinched so hard my heart stuttered. I kept going anyway, because I am not prey and I am not staying.

The night air hit my face like a slap.

It should have helped.

It didn’t.

It made the nausea worse.

I stumbled to a low wall near the entrance and sat down. I pressed my palms against my thighs, anchoring myself. The world was too bright and too loud and too far away.

I stared at the street and tried to keep my eyes open.

Don’t pass out. Don’t pass out. Don’t pass out.

Headlights swung around the corner and pulled up.

Lauren’s car.

The door opened and there she was—hair pulled back, face set, that particular mother-steel expression that says: *I am here and the world will now behave.*

She crossed to me quickly.

“Sarah,” she said, and crouched slightly so she was level with my face. “Look at me.”

I did. It took effort. But I did.

“Can you stand?” she asked.

“I—” My voice wobbled. “I think—”

“Okay,” she said. “We’re not rushing. Bree’s not here, so I’m your hands. Give me your bag.”

I handed it over like a child, and the humiliation should have killed me.

It didn’t.

Because Lauren didn’t treat me like a child.

She treated me like a woman whose body had been compromised and needed a plan.

Lauren slid an arm around my shoulders—firm, steady—and helped me stand.

“Walk with me,” she said.

I walked.

Each step felt like it was happening through water.

Lauren got me into the car, buckled my seatbelt with brisk competence, and shut the door like she was sealing me inside safety.

She got in and started the engine.

Only then did she speak again.

“I’m taking you to mine,” she said. “You’re not going home alone tonight.”

I swallowed. My throat felt wrong.

“I’m sorry,” I whispered automatically.

Lauren’s head snapped toward me.

“No,” she said, flat. “Not that. Not ever.”

The word landed like a slap and a hug at the same time.

I went quiet.

Lauren drove with one hand on the wheel and the other ready—just there, near the console, like she could catch me if my body tried to fall apart.

Halfway to her place, she asked, “Are you going to vomit?”

I blinked at the practical question, absurdly grateful for it.

“Maybe.”

“Okay,” she said. “There’s a bag. Use it if you need. You’re not embarrassing.”

I made a small sound that might have been a laugh if I’d had more oxygen.

At her apartment, Lauren guided me inside, shoes off, lights low, water poured.

She sat me on the couch and tucked a throw around my shoulders with the kind of efficiency that would make Mara nod once and say nothing.

Then Lauren crouched in front of me again.

“Sarah,” she said, “I’m going to ask you something and you can answer yes or no.”

I nodded.

“Do you feel safe right now?”

I blinked hard.

“Yes,” I whispered.

“Good,” she said. “Then we slow down. We hydrate. We keep you awake enough to stay oriented. And if anything changes—breathing, chest, pain—we escalate.”

The word escalate should have frightened me.

Instead it steadied me.

Because Lauren wasn’t guessing.

She was managing.

I leaned back into the couch, dizzy, and my eyes burned unexpectedly.

Lauren saw it and didn’t comment. She just sat beside me, not touching, present like a wall you could lean on.

After a while, the nausea eased into something duller. The panic receded, replaced by exhaustion.

Lauren handed me another glass of water.

I drank.

My hands shook.

Lauren watched without judgement.

The silence stretched.

And in that silence, my brain—traitorous, inconvenient—offered me the thought I’d been avoiding all night:

*You called her.*

Not Bree.

Not the police.

Her.

Because somewhere in my body, Lauren had become the definition of “safe.”

Not as a concept.

As a person.

Lauren checked her phone, then looked at me.

“Do you want me to call Bree?” she asked gently.

I hesitated. Then shook my head.

“No,” I said, voice rough. “Not yet.”

Lauren didn’t press.

“Okay,” she said. “Then you sleep here. Bedroom’s yours. Door closes. I’ll be in the lounge.”

My throat tightened.

“You don’t have to—”

Lauren’s look cut clean through me.

“I do,” she said. “Because you’re not going to wake up alone and wonder if you imagined it.”

I swallowed.

“Okay,” I whispered.

Lauren stood, then paused.

“And Sarah,” she added, softer, “tomorrow we can talk about reporting it. Or checking in medically. Or none of that. But tonight you’re just… alive. That’s the job.”

Alive.

That word landed in my chest like a weight.

She guided me to the bedroom—nothing intimate, nothing loaded—just a woman escorting another woman to safety. She handed me a clean t-shirt, pointed at the bathroom, left the door ajar.

I changed slowly, clumsy and tired, then crawled into the bed like it belonged to someone else.

The room was dark and quiet.

I heard Lauren moving softly in the lounge—kettle, cupboard, the small sounds of a competent woman keeping watch without announcing it.

And then I slept.

---

In the morning, my mouth tasted like regret and my head felt full of sand.

I lay still for a moment, letting the hangover assemble itself into a coherent list of complaints.

Then I remembered everything.

The bar. The wrongness. The bench outside. Lauren’s voice, steady as a handrail.

The shame hit next—automatic, predictable.

*You’re thirty-something and you called someone’s mum.*

I sat up too quickly and had to stop. The room tilted. I pressed my palm to my forehead, breathing through it.

A tap at the door.

Lauren’s voice, careful. “You awake?”

“Yes,” I croaked.

She came in with water and toast like she’d done it a thousand times, and maybe she had.

She set the tray on the bedside table and looked at me, not hovering.

“How’s your head?” she asked.

“Like someone built a shed inside it,” I muttered.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Fair.”

I took the water with both hands. Drank. Slowly.

Lauren sat on the chair near the window, not on the bed—space respected.

“Do you remember what happened?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice went quieter. “I… felt wrong. Too fast.”

Lauren nodded, filing it.

“Okay,” she said. “We don’t have to decide anything this second. But I want you to know: you did the right thing calling.”

The words landed, warm and sharp.

I stared at the toast like it contained answers.

“I didn’t want to bother you,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze held mine.

“You didn’t bother me,” she replied. “You trusted me.”

My throat tightened again, stupidly.

I tried to deflect.

“Because you’re terrifying,” I said dryly.

Lauren’s laugh was small. “I’ll take it.”

I took another sip of water, hands still slightly shaky.

Then I said the thing that had been sitting in my chest since the bench outside the bar.

“Lauren,” I began, and my voice caught. “I… I think I use you as—”

“A safety blanket,” Lauren finished gently, not mocking.

I blinked, embarrassed.

Lauren tilted her head.

“It’s not an insult,” she said. “You were scared. You reached for the safest person you know. That’s rational.”

I looked down at my hands.

“But,” Lauren continued, quiet now, “I don’t think that’s the whole truth.”

My pulse did a strange, hot little stumble.

I looked up.

Lauren’s expression was open—still adult, still in control—but softer than I’d ever seen it, like she was allowing herself to be human in front of me.

“Sarah,” she said, “you don’t have to decide anything today. But you should know something.”

I waited. Breath held.

“I like you,” Lauren said. Simple. Clean. “As you are. Sharp. Difficult. Funny. Honest when it costs you.”

The room went very still.

My skin prickled.

I should have made a joke.

I couldn’t.

Lauren didn’t move closer. She didn’t take my hand. She didn’t try to seal the moment into a story.

She just let the truth sit there, like a cup placed gently on a table.

And in the quiet that followed, I realised—with a clarity that made my chest ache—that this feeling in me wasn’t relief anymore.

It wasn’t gratitude.

It wasn’t even safety.

It was… wanting.

Not loud. Not dramatic.

Just a steady, inconvenient pull toward the woman in the chair.

I swallowed, suddenly terrified—not of her, not of intimacy, but of the sheer scale of how much sense it made.

“I’m not—” I started, and stopped.

Lauren waited, patient.

I took a breath, careful.

“I think,” I said slowly, “I called you because I wanted you to come.”

Lauren’s eyes softened.

“Yes,” she said, so quiet it was almost a whisper. “I know.”

My heart thudded once, hard.

I stared at her, and for the first time in a long time I didn’t feel like I had to be clever to be safe.

I just had to be honest.

“I don’t know what to do with that,” I admitted.

Lauren nodded once.

“Good,” she said. “Then we do nothing dramatic. We do boring.”

I huffed a laugh. “Boring.”

“Boring,” Lauren confirmed. “Tea. Toast. Water. A quiet day. And later—when your head stops trying to kill you—we talk. Like adults.”

My throat tightened again, but this time it wasn’t shame.

It was something warmer.

Something that felt, inconveniently, like hope.

I nodded.

“Okay,” I said.

And Lauren’s smile—small, steady—was the softest kind of victory.

Not conquest.

Not rescue.

Just two women, choosing to treat the moment with care.

Like everything else in our world that mattered. 💛

---

[Q]  
Whew! Do we do this from Lauren's POV? Perhaps revealing - either in retrospect after Sarah's gone to sleep, or however you think is *proper* - that Lauren has feelings... and has HAD feelings for Sarah for a long time.

[A]

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116af.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

Absolutely. And yes — doing this from Lauren’s POV is the *proper* way to reveal it, because Lauren is the one person who would never *say* it until the moment demanded honesty. She’s been carrying it like she carries everything else: quietly, competently, without making it anyone else’s problem. 💛

Here’s a companion piece you can append as a coda to Scene 44, or save as its own scene (I’d label it a new one, because the emotional revelation is a genuine event even if the timeline overlaps).

---

## **Scene 45 — “After” (Lauren POV)**

When Sarah fell asleep, the apartment didn’t go quiet.

It changed temperature.

The kind of hush you get after an emergency has ended but your body hasn’t accepted it yet—after the adrenaline, before the relief.

I stood in the hallway for a moment with my hand on the doorframe, listening.

Sarah’s breathing was deep now, regular, the sharp edge gone. She’d curled toward the pillow like she did when she was exhausted, one arm tucked under her face as if she was still trying to anchor herself.

She looked younger like that.

Not childish—Sarah would claw your eyes out for the implication.

Just… unarmoured.

I shut the bedroom door almost all the way, leaving it cracked. Habit. Safety. A quiet promise: *you won’t wake up trapped.*

Then I went back into the lounge and started doing what I always did when something scared me.

I cleaned.

Not because the place was messy. Because movement makes a plan out of panic. Because my hands can be busy even when my mind wants to run.

I rinsed the glass she’d used. I wiped the bench. I checked my phone again: no missed calls, no new messages, nothing urgent from the building manager or the venue. I made myself a cup of tea and didn’t drink it.

My hands were steady.

My chest was not.

I kept seeing her on that bench outside the bar: the way her eyes had struggled to focus, the way her pride had tried to keep her upright even when her body was arguing with her.

Sarah, who could dismantle a man with a sentence.

Sarah, who had called me with a voice I didn’t recognise.

*I need you.*

I sat down at the kitchen table and let the truth arrive, the one I’d been refusing to name cleanly for a long time:

It wasn’t the call that changed anything.

The call had only confirmed what I already knew.

I had been in love with Sarah for years.

Not the dramatic version. Not the operatic version. The version that grows inside you while you’re busy being an adult.

It had started, I realised, with anger.

The first time I saw her at Wardrobe, I’d thought: *Oh. One of those women.*

The sharp ones. The ones who use sarcasm like a fence. The ones who look like they can’t be moved.

Then I watched her work.

I watched her notice things other people missed. I watched her hold the line without making it a performance. I watched her take care of the room in the way she pretended not to.

And one day—months later—something small happened: a junior staffer had been crying in the corridor, trying to hide it. Sarah didn’t make a fuss. She didn’t comfort her like a mother.

She simply stood beside her, angled her body to block the view, and said quietly, *“Go wash your face. I’ll cover you. Mara doesn’t need a story.”*

No softness. No pity.

Just protection that didn’t cost the girl her dignity.

That was when I’d felt it—the first deep, inconvenient pull.

I’d buried it immediately, of course.

Because I was a mother. Because I was busy. Because my life already had enough stakes. Because Sarah was Sarah, and the last thing she needed was someone deciding she was a project.

And because… Charli.

My child.

I’d already made one private vow, years ago, and it had hardened into my bones:

*No partner of mine will ever be a complication for my kid.*

If I wanted something, I would want it in a way that didn’t risk her.

So I did what I always do with feelings I can’t afford.

I contained them.

I channelled them into being useful.

Into being steady.

Into being the woman Sarah could ring in a crisis without fear of judgement, because she’d know what she’d get: help first, questions later.

Even now, I could justify it as practical.

Sarah needed a safe person.

She’d found one.

That didn’t mean anything else.

Except tonight it did.

Because when she’d said, in that slow, careful voice, *I think I called you because I wanted you to come,* my body had gone very still.

Not startled.

Recognising.

It wasn’t a confession exactly. Sarah didn’t do confessions. But it was a hinge. A small door cracking open.

And I’d felt—immediately—two impulses arrive at once:

The first was warmth. Hope.

The second was fear so clean it was almost anger.

Because Sarah was vulnerable, and I would never take advantage of that vulnerability. Not even by accident. Not even with a look that could be misread.

Which meant I had to do something I am very good at.

I had to wait.

I sipped my tea finally, mostly because the warmth gave my hands a task.

In the quiet, I thought about what “proper” looked like here.

Proper wasn’t secrecy.

Proper wasn’t “slipping into something” because it felt good in the aftermath of fear.

Proper was daylight, when her head was clear.

Proper was consent that didn’t arrive in desperation.

Proper was the kind of slow honesty that didn’t ask Sarah to become softer than she was, only to be truer.

I looked down the hallway again.

Charli’s door was closed.

Charli was safe.

And the thought that followed was unexpected and sharp:

If Sarah became part of our life, it wouldn’t threaten Charli.

It would strengthen the network around her.

Sarah didn’t infantilise. Sarah didn’t perform. Sarah didn’t use love as a leash.

Sarah would be fierce in the way I understood: standards, not sentiment.

The kind of woman you want near your daughter.

The kind of woman you want near you.

I sat there for a long time, letting the tea go cold, letting my mind settle into the only plan that made sense:

Tomorrow, I would check Sarah’s body first: water, food, rest.

Then I would give her something else: space.

Not distance. Not withdrawal.

Space to choose.

Because if she wanted me—if this was real and not just the reflex of being rescued—she’d come back to it when she was steady.

Sarah always did things properly, eventually.

Even if she pretended she didn’t.

I stood, turned off the lounge light, and left a small lamp on in the hallway.

Not bright.

Just enough.

A quiet signpost for the night: *you’re not alone, and you’re not trapped.*

Then I lay on the couch with a blanket, fully dressed, because mothers don’t sleep deeply after something like this.

And in the dark, I admitted the truth without flinching:

I had loved Sarah for a long time.

I could keep loving her quietly if that was what the world required.

But if she reached for me in daylight—clear-headed and deliberate—

I would let myself be chosen.

And I would choose her back.

Properly.

---

[Q]  
And then, still in Lauren's POV, the next morning. And the realisation that Sarah is beginning to feel the same way. ((Since it's in Lauren's POV, we could do it as a follow-on?)


<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">








##

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ag.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

## **Scene 46 — “Daylight” (Lauren POV)**

Morning always tells the truth.

Night can be anything—fear, adrenaline, loneliness dressed up as clarity. Night makes people reach for whatever feels like a handrail.

But morning… morning is where you find out whether the handrail is still wanted when the floor is stable again.

I woke before Sarah did, because mothers don’t sleep well after danger. Even when the danger is gone, your body keeps listening for it like an animal.

The apartment was quiet in the clean way it gets quiet when someone safe is asleep in the next room.

I lay still on the couch for a moment and listened.

No coughing. No restless pacing. Just Sarah’s breathing, deep and steady through the cracked door.

Good.

I made tea first, because boiling water is a kind of prayer: something you do with your hands while your mind measures the day.

Toast followed. Not because toast is magic, but because it’s non-threatening. It’s what you feed someone when you want them to feel cared for without feeling managed.

While the kettle worked, I checked my phone.

No new messages from the venue. No update from the building manager. No fresh nonsense from a blocked number.

Still, I made a note to myself: **encourage medical check**. Not because I wanted to escalate things into drama, but because women don’t get to rely on luck.

I heard a shift from the bedroom—sheet rustle, a small exhale, the sound of someone waking and trying to decide if they’re in a place that’s allowed.

Then the door opened.

Sarah stood in the doorway in my spare t-shirt, hair a mess, eyes narrowed like she was judging the light for being too cheerful.

She looked… human.

Which, for Sarah, is an intimate state.

She didn’t step all the way in. She stayed on the threshold like she might still bolt out of politeness.

“Morning,” she said, voice rough.

“Morning,” I replied. “Water first.”

She made a face that was half annoyance, half obedience, and came to the kitchen.

I poured her a glass and handed it over without ceremony.

Sarah took it with both hands and drank like someone who’d been taught, at some point, to trust procedure.

Remembering it now.

When she finished, she set the glass down and glanced at the toast.

“Are you trying to make me a Victorian invalid,” she muttered.

I let my mouth twitch. “Yes. It’s my long-term plan.”

Sarah huffed a laugh—small, but real—and slid onto the chair by the window.

Not the couch.

The chair.

Distance maintained.

Control reclaimed.

Good.

I placed the toast in front of her and sat opposite, keeping my posture relaxed, my voice ordinary.

“How’s your head?” I asked.

Sarah grimaced. “Like someone’s rewired it badly.”

“Fair,” I said. “Nausea? Dizziness?”

“Less,” she admitted. “Still… wrong. But less.”

I nodded, filing it.

“I’d like you to get checked today,” I said gently. “Even if it’s just a GP. Blood pressure, basics. If you think someone put something in your drink—”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened. Instantly defensive.

“I don’t *know* they did,” she said.

“I know,” I replied. “You don’t have to prove it. You only have to take care of your body.”

Sarah stared at the toast like it had offended her.

Then, quietly: “Okay.”

Not “fine.”

Not “whatever.”

Okay.

A second “okay” in less than twelve hours.

That was… notable.

I didn’t push. I didn’t turn it into a lecture. I let it sit like a small win.

For a minute, the only sound was her chewing and the kettle cooling, the familiar domestic noises that make a life feel possible.

Then Sarah cleared her throat.

Here it comes, I thought. Pride.

And it did.

“I’m sorry,” she said, automatically. Fast, as if she could throw it at the floor and move on.

I looked at her, calm.

“No,” I said. “Not that.”

Sarah’s jaw tightened. “Lauren—”

“No,” I repeated, not unkind. “You don’t apologise for being in danger. You don’t apologise for calling someone. You did the correct thing.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked up to mine, then away. The smallest hint of colour climbed her cheeks—anger at being seen, probably.

“I hate needing help,” she said.

“I know,” I said.

That was all. No pep talk. No insistence.

Just acknowledgement.

Sarah took another bite of toast, slower now, as if her body was remembering it could accept care without owing anything in return.

She swallowed. Then, after a pause that felt like a door opening by a millimetre, she said:

“I remember what I said last night.”

My chest went very still.

I kept my face calm.

“Yes,” I replied, careful. “Me too.”

Sarah’s fingers tightened around the mug I’d given her, knuckles whitening slightly. She didn’t drink. She just held it like an anchor.

“I meant it,” she said, voice low.

The words were simple, but Sarah saying *I meant it* was… enormous.

Because Sarah doesn’t say anything she can’t defend in court.

My pulse quickened. I didn’t move closer. I didn’t rush.

This had to stay clean. Proper.

“I’m glad,” I said softly.

Sarah looked up then, properly, meeting my eyes.

Her expression wasn’t soft. Sarah wasn’t suddenly a different person.

But something in her gaze had changed.

Less armour.

More decision.

“It wasn’t just because I was scared,” she said, as if she resented the need to clarify it. “I mean, I *was* scared. But that’s not why I—”

She stopped, frustrated with language.

I waited.

She exhaled sharply, then said it in the most Sarah way possible—like she was stating a fact she’d verified twice:

“I wanted you to come.”

The sentence landed in the kitchen like a bell.

I felt warmth rise through me—quiet, steady—and I held it there, contained. Not because I wanted to hide it, but because Sarah would recoil if I made her the centre of a romantic spectacle.

“I did come,” I said. “Every time you call, I’ll come.”

Sarah’s eyes narrowed. “That’s not what I’m asking.”

I blinked once.

“No,” I agreed, and let my voice soften a fraction. “It isn’t.”

Sarah sat very still, as if her body had decided that moving might make the moment break.

Then she said, with a kind of blunt honesty that nearly undid me:

“I don’t know what to do with it.”

I nodded.

“That’s okay,” I said. “We don’t have to do anything dramatic.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. “Your obsession with boring is unbearable.”

“It works,” I replied.

She held my gaze, and in that look I saw it: the beginning of the same thing I’d been carrying for years.

Not as a lightning strike.

As a slow, inevitable shift of gravity.

Sarah wasn’t reaching for me as a mother.

She was reaching for me as… me.

A woman.

A possibility.

The realisation didn’t make me giddy. It made me careful.

Because if Sarah was beginning to feel it, she’d be terrified of it. Not because she was ashamed of women—Sarah didn’t do shame that way.

But because wanting someone meant giving them leverage.

And Sarah hated leverage.

I stood and rinsed a plate to give my hands something to do.

When I turned back, Sarah was watching me.

Not suspicious.

Just… present.

“You can go home whenever you want,” I said gently. “No pressure. No expectations.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked to the hallway, to the door, to the light on the counter.

Then back to me.

“I know,” she said.

A pause.

Then: “Can I stay a bit longer?”

The request was quiet, but it was the most intimate thing she’d said all morning.

My chest tightened.

“Yes,” I said simply. “Of course.”

Sarah exhaled, a long breath that sounded like surrender—not to me, but to the fact that she wanted what she wanted.

I poured more tea, because tea is what you do when you’re making a new shape of life.

And as Sarah sat at my kitchen table in my spare t-shirt, eating toast like it was a contract she hadn’t yet signed, I felt the truth settle more firmly inside me:

This wasn’t a night thing.

This wasn’t fear.

This wasn’t rescue.

This was daylight.

And Sarah, inconvenient and sharp and brave, was beginning to reach for me on purpose.

Properly.

[Q]  
This is a slightly different story arc than the one we'd done before. Better, actually. More cohesive. I also feel that what we did in the beginning of the story served primarily - and very effectively - to illustrate the work (and *life*) environment the stories of these women takes place in. Very solid, emphasising not just the craft but how the women have formed a web of protection for themselves. 

Last time, I think at this stage I'd asked you 1) where we were on  the arc and 2) were there any other stones to turn over. Same question applies today.

---

[A]
([Past chat][1])([Past chat][2])([Past chat][3])([Past chat][4])([Past chat][4])

Yes — and I agree with your read: the early stretch has done its real job. It *built the habitat* (Wardrobe as a living, standards-driven organism) and proved the **women’s web** is practical, scalable, and emotionally believable — not “girlboss vibes,” but *systems*. 🧵💛

Since the personal context search didn’t surface the older outline we’d referenced, I’ll treat **today’s arc** as canonical and answer your two questions cleanly, plus “stones to turn over.”

---

## 1) Where are we on the arc right now?

### What’s been achieved (big structural beats)

* **Wardrobe is established as a women-governed domain**: craft + policy + quiet enforcement. The safe-space logic is now *earned* and internalized.
* **Charli’s belonging moved from conditional to embodied** (the “proper” glow, the room matching her body, structure replacing fear).
* **Sarah’s lens has become a valid secondary engine**: she’s not just “snark”; she’s now a character with a coherent emotional trajectory.
* **Sarah → Lauren is now seeded properly**: not a “rescuer crush,” but daylight-choice territory. The romance is positioned as *adult*, not impulsive.

### Where that puts us on a classical story curve

You’re around the end of **Act 2A / entering Act 2B** of a novel-ish structure:

* Act 1: Wardrobe + culture + stakes + Charli’s integration.
* Act 2A: complications + proof of the web + personal arcs emerge.
* **Act 2B (next):** intimacy and desire begin colliding with policy, reputation, and self-concept — the “can I want this and still be myself?” phase.

So: we’re **past setup**, **past first proof**, and now we’re at the point where *the network gets tested emotionally*, not just operationally.

---

## 2) Other stones to turn over (high-value threads to mine)

Here are the best “stones” — ones that add depth without derailing your tone or turning into melodrama.

### Stone A: The Wardrobe rule that romance must obey

You already implied it: **not at work**. But it’s worth one explicit scene where the *policy and the heart* meet:

* Lauren and Sarah agree on boundaries (no workplace signals, no gossip fuel).
* Mara is informed in exactly one sentence (or she infers, and simply sets a standard).
* The web proves it can hold *love* without letting love turn into chaos.

This strengthens your “women’s competence network” theme: romance doesn’t dissolve professionalism; it’s folded into it.

### Stone B: Sarah’s identity integration (without a label lecture)

Sarah doesn’t need to “come out” like it’s 1997. She needs:

* one private reckoning (already seeded: the high-school crush),
* one honest conversation with Bree (who is gay, and will be kind-but-not-sentimental),
* one moment of *choice* that isn’t guilt-driven (daylight, calm, deliberate).

This avoids trope and keeps Sarah *Sarah*: sharp, slightly allergic to earnestness.

### Stone C: Carl as a “good man” who stays good

This is gold for avoiding caricature. You can use Carl again briefly, later, to *prove*:

* he doesn’t retaliate,
* he doesn’t become a villain,
* he remains decent (and maybe even becomes an ally in a practical way, e.g., quietly fixes something at Wardrobe without drama).
  It shows the story’s critique is about **structures + entitlement**, not “men are inherently evil.”

### Stone D: The spiking incident’s after-echo

Not procedural. Not courtroom. But one or two *realistic* consequences:

* Sarah becomes hypervigilant for a week (annoyed at herself).
* Lauren quietly upgrades safety habits (rideshare plan, check-ins).
* Bree cracks jokes, but also gets serious for one line.
  This turns it from a plot device into a character-forging event.

### Stone E: Charli + Celeste romance progression (parallel track)

Right now the emotional spotlight has swung to Sarah/Lauren — which is great — but you’ll want **one small beat** that keeps Charli/Celeste alive in the reader’s mind:

* a micro-scene showing Celeste softening “one notch further,”
* Charli receiving structure as affection,
* and the romance moving by **permission + ritual**, not fireworks.

Otherwise readers can feel whiplash: “Wait—what about *that* couple?”

### Stone F: The “web” faces a non-male stressor

To avoid the sense that men are the only threat vector, give Wardrobe one challenge that is:

* a supplier failure,
* a schedule crunch,
* a client boundary issue that’s not gendered,
* or a woman who is chaotic/unsafe in a different way (you’ve done versions of this before; it’s always strong).
  Then show the web holding.

It proves the system is about **standards**, not about “us vs men.”

### Stone G: Lauren’s motherhood boundary

This one is emotionally rich:

* Lauren must ensure Sarah is not “joining the family” as a dependency — Sarah would hate that too.
* Charli’s safety remains primary, but not as a wedge.
  A single scene where Lauren privately checks herself (“no mixing roles; no making Sarah a second parent; keep it clean”) would be powerful.

---

## A practical “map” from here (3–5 scenes worth)

If you want a near-term run that feels cohesive:

1. **Bree/Sarah truth-talk** (one scene; light humour, one sincere line)
2. **Lauren + Sarah: boundaries agreement** (daylight, boring, adult)
3. **Wardrobe: micro-proof the romance stays off-clock** (Mara standard-setting in one sentence)
4. **Charli/Celeste: one gentle beat** (parallel romance, not stealing focus)
5. **A non-male operational stress test** (the web holds; competence porn 😄)

If you tell me which couple you want to be the “spine” of the next 3 scenes (Sarah/Lauren vs Charli/Celeste), I’ll pick the tightest ordering. If you’d rather not decide, I can just choose the strongest sequence and start drafting immediately. 💛

[Q]  
I tend to agree that we should return to Celeste and Charli (their story, after all). And yes, their intimacy does need to blossom a bit into desire (again, more about Celeste at this point, her hesitation, fear of ... all the things she worries about ... but balanced with an increasing desire for touch: Charli's touch. She discovers quite by accident that Charli's touch is so delicate, so gentle, unbelieveably so, Celeste wants it. More of it. (So, we're not talking s*x, here... *touch*). And kisses. And cuddling. And... well... more... it's all touch. Only touch, even when it results in bliss. Celeste has finally let the floodgates open.

And devoted Charli - always caring, eager, fills her cup to the brim. But, injudiciously, fails to do the appropriate thing in a work environment, where it's unsafe for Celeste. 

And: consequences.

Yes. This is *exactly* the right kind of blossom for them: **touch as truth**, not sex as plot device. And the “workplace slip” is *perfect* because it lets you prove (again) that Wardrobe’s safety isn’t vibes — it’s **standards**, and standards have consequences even when the love is real. 💛🧵

Below is a clean run of **three scenes** that do what you’ve asked:

* **Scene 47 (Celeste POV):** floodgates open by accident — Charli’s touch is revealed as *unbearably* gentle; Celeste wants more.
* **Scene 48 (Celeste POV):** Charli slips at work (small, “innocent,” but unsafe), and the risk becomes real.
* **Scene 49 (Celeste POV):** consequences — not cruelty, not punishment theatre: *structure*. Celeste leads, sets boundary, and re-anchors Wardrobe’s safety. Charli learns.

## **Scene 47 — “The Floodgates” (Celeste POV)**

It started the way most dangerous things start.

Quietly.

We were in the kitchen after dinner, the apartment dim and ordinary, the kind of evening that didn’t feel like it was making history. The kettle had clicked off a minute ago. The sink was full of dishes we would both pretend we didn’t see for ten minutes.

Charli was at the table with the ledger notebook open—not Wardrobe’s ledger, *hers*: the small private one where she copied recipes, wrote lists, rehearsed the shapes of competence the way other people rehearsed speeches.

She had her hair up, still damp from her shower. No cap, no kerchief, no pinned discipline—just herself. A girl in a t-shirt with a pen in her hand, trying to be useful in the only way she knew how: by preparing.

I leaned on the counter and watched her without meaning to.

I didn’t *intend* to be like this.

I’d told myself a hundred times: keep it clean. Keep it professional. Keep it safe. I’d been good at that. I’d built it into my bones the way I’d built Wardrobe’s rules into my mouth: calm voice, clear line, no ambiguity.

But somewhere over the last weeks, that discipline had started to cost me.

Because Charli wasn’t a project anymore.

She wasn’t “an interesting case.”

She wasn’t even “my responsibility.”

She was… *mine*, in a way my body understood before my mind allowed it.

She looked up and caught me looking.

Her smile arrived softly, like it had to be earned.

“You’re thinking,” she said.

“I’m always thinking,” I replied.

Charli’s eyes warmed—no argument, no flinch. She went back to her notebook, and I realised what I was actually watching: her hands.

Long-fingered. Careful. Precise. A person who touched paper the way she touched fabric: as if it had feelings.

I said, mostly to give myself something to do, “Show me what you’re writing.”

Charli hesitated—a small, old reflex of fear—then she slid the notebook toward me. Not defensive. Not secretive. Just offering.

I walked around to the table and leaned in to read.

A list.

Simple.

**GP appointment**
**bloods**
**script pick-up**
**hair pins (more)**
**salt (for pasta water)**
**thank Lauren?** (crossed out, then rewritten: **tell Lauren.**)

My chest tightened at that last line. Not because of Lauren. Because of the way Charli kept learning: not theatrically. Not with speeches. With small corrections. With practice.

I tapped the page lightly.

“This is good,” I said.

Charli’s shoulders lifted and lowered, a quiet exhale.

“I don’t want to forget,” she murmured.

“You won’t,” I said, and then—without planning to—added, “You’re not alone.”

Charli went still.

Not frightened. Not startled.

Just… struck.

Her eyes came up to mine, wide and bright, and for a moment she looked so young I felt something inside me soften dangerously.

She didn’t speak. She didn’t need to.

The wanting in her face was not sexual. It was worse than that.

It was trust.

It was devotion.

It was the look of someone who had been starving and didn’t quite believe food was allowed.

I should have looked away.

I didn’t.

Charli’s hand lifted—slow, tentative—as if she was asking permission from the air.

She reached toward my wrist where it rested on the table.

I felt the pause in her fingers before contact: that careful millimetre where she waited to see if I would pull away.

I didn’t.

Her fingertips touched my skin.

And my whole body reacted as if she’d turned on a light.

It wasn’t heat. Not exactly.

It was… relief.

Touch so gentle it didn’t feel like a claim. Touch so careful it felt like reverence. The smallest pressure, a feather of contact, but it landed inside me like certainty.

Charli’s thumb made one slow, tentative stroke across the inside of my wrist.

I inhaled sharply.

Charli froze, immediately—eyes flashing with panic.

“Sorry—” she began.

“No,” I said, too fast.

The word came out rougher than I intended.

Charli’s mouth closed. She watched my face, braced for correction, for withdrawal, for the old rules.

I forced myself to slow down.

“Don’t apologise,” I said, quieter. “Just… don’t stop.”

Charli’s eyes widened.

A flush rose in her cheeks, soft and disbelieving.

“Are you sure?” she whispered.

I hated how much I needed her to do it again.

“Yes,” I said, flat, because if I tried to make it pretty I’d lose control. “I’m sure.”

Charli’s hand returned, slower this time, as if she was learning me the way she learned fabric: testing tension, reading response, adjusting.

Her thumb traced the same small stroke again.

My skin prickled. My throat tightened. Something in my chest gave way with a quiet, internal sound—like a knot finally untying.

I had spent so long holding myself back—out of caution, out of responsibility, out of fear of becoming the kind of woman who takes what she wants without considering the cost.

But this didn’t feel like taking.

It felt like being met.

I looked down at her hand on mine and realised, with a shock that was almost comic, that Charli’s touch was not demanding.

It was offering.

Which made my own hunger feel unbearable.

I turned my palm over, slowly, and let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not possessive.

Just… answering.

Charli’s breath hitched.

Her eyes shone, the way they did when she wanted to cry but refused to perform it.

“Celeste,” she whispered, like my name was a place.

I swallowed.

“This,” I said, trying to make my voice steady, “is not a reward.”

Charli blinked.

“It’s not something you earn by being good,” I continued. “Do you understand me?”

Her expression shifted—confused, then dawning.

“You mean…” she began.

“I mean,” I said, and my voice softened despite myself, “I want it too.”

Charli’s lips parted slightly, stunned.

I could have left it there. I should have.

Instead, I leaned down—slowly, deliberately—and kissed her.

Not hungry.

Not urgent.

A small kiss, precise as a pin placed correctly. A kiss that asked a question and waited for the answer.

Charli answered by making the smallest sound in her throat and lifting her free hand to my waist—light, careful, as if she was afraid I’d dissolve.

Her touch there was just as gentle.

And it nearly undid me.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead lightly against hers.

“Touch,” I murmured, the word half a confession. “That’s all I want tonight.”

Charli nodded quickly, almost frantic with relief.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can—yes.”

I guided her up from the table and toward the couch. We sat, close, and she curled against me with the cautious joy of someone waiting for the rules to change back.

They didn’t.

I wrapped an arm around her and let her settle.

Charli’s hand slid along my forearm, then my shoulder, then my collarbone—each touch a question, each pause a check-in.

It was unbearably sweet.

It was… bliss, in the simplest sense: my body unclenching, my mind quieting, the world narrowing to the fact of her presence.

Charli kissed my cheek once, then my jaw, then—very carefully—my throat, as if she’d learned I might break there.

I closed my eyes.

The floodgates opened with no drama at all.

Just a steady, unstoppable softness.

And in the dark, held by the gentlest hands I’d ever known, I realised the truth I’d been skirting for months:

I wasn’t losing control.

I was finally allowing myself to be loved.

---

## **Scene 48 — “Unsafe” (Celeste POV)**

The next day at Wardrobe, I walked in wearing my usual face.

Calm. Clear. Adult.

But my body had changed overnight in a way I couldn’t hide from myself: it remembered Charli’s touch.

It wanted it.

Even in the bright clatter of morning, even with steam in the air and Mara’s shears already snicking like punctuation, my skin carried the echo of her fingers the way fabric carries perfume.

Charli arrived ten minutes after me.

She came in quieter than usual, as if she was trying to be respectful of something she didn’t fully understand yet: that intimacy changes gravity.

Her eyes met mine for half a beat, and her mouth softened.

Not a grin.

Not a performance.

Just… a private warmth.

I kept my expression neutral and turned back to the ledger.

We had actresses coming in mid-morning. A fitting schedule. A collar repair. A cap batch that needed tying.

Everything normal.

Which meant everything fragile.

Because Wardrobe isn’t just a workplace. It’s a structure. A shelter. It’s women’s safety engineered into habits.

And safety is not compatible with visible romance.

Not here.

Not yet.

Charli moved to the cap table, began sorting ties, checking angles with her new competence. Mara barked a correction; Charli absorbed it without flinching. Lauren strode through with her clipboard. Sarah looked like she’d slept badly but held her posture like a weapon.

I was grateful for the noise. It kept me composed.

Then—because life loves irony—an actress arrived early, cheerful and loud, bringing the energy of an audience.

“Morning! Oh my god, this place is like a *beehive!*”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “Stand still. Talk later.”

The actress laughed, compliant.

Charli turned to fetch something from the shelf behind her, and she brushed past me in the narrow aisle between tables.

I felt her pause.

I didn’t look up.

Then her fingers—light as breath—touched the back of my hand.

A tiny, secret stroke. A *private* affection.

It lasted less than a second.

It was enough.

Because my body reacted before my mind could stop it: a small shiver under my skin, a tightening in my throat, a pulse spike that made me suddenly aware of my own mouth.

It was a human response.

Which is exactly why it was dangerous.

Charli’s eyes flicked up to my face, bright with that same hopeful devotion from last night, and she smiled—small, pleased—because she’d felt my reaction and interpreted it as permission.

I held very still.

Across the room, Sarah’s gaze snapped toward us.

Not jealous.

Not judging.

Alert.

She had the instincts of a woman who knows what men—and gossip—do with information.

And two tables away, the actress’s eyes slid over us with curiosity.

The wrong kind.

A glance too long. A faint tilt of the mouth. Interest.

Data being collected.

I felt my stomach go cold.

Charli didn’t see any of that. She was still living in the softness of last night, still floating in the relief of being wanted.

She reached—without thinking—and tucked a loose strand of hair behind my ear.

A gesture so gentle, so domestic, so *girlfriend*, it might as well have been an announcement.

The room didn’t stop.

But the temperature changed.

Sarah’s posture sharpened.

Lauren’s head lifted.

Mara’s eyes flicked up, brief and hard.

And the actress smiled like she’d just found a delicious new subplot.

I turned my head slowly and looked at Charli.

Not angry.

Not cruel.

But my expression was enough.

Charli’s face drained of colour.

Her hand fell away as if it had been burned.

I leaned closer—not to soften it, but to keep it private.

“Not here,” I said, low.

Charli’s eyes widened in horror.

“I—” she began.

“Not here,” I repeated, firmer. “Never at work. Do you understand me?”

Charli swallowed hard.

“Yes,” she whispered.

Her voice trembled. Her eyes shone.

She looked like someone who had just realised she’d walked into traffic.

I straightened and turned back to the ledger.

The actress chirped, oblivious or pretending to be. “Sorry—am I early?”

Lauren answered smoothly, saving the moment like she saved everything.

“You’re early,” Lauren said pleasantly. “But we’ll take you. Fitting room, please.”

The actress followed Lauren, still smiling.

Still storing.

Charli stood frozen at the cap table, hands hovering, afraid to touch anything.

I didn’t look at her again.

Not because I didn’t want to.

Because if I did, I might soften.

And softness at the wrong time is how women get hurt.

## **Scene 49 — “Consequences” (Celeste POV)**

I waited until lunch.

Not because I wanted to punish her with time.

Because if I spoke too soon, my voice would carry the wrong emotion.

I needed to be the adult.

And—this was the new part—I needed to be the adult while my body still wanted her hands on my skin.

That was the discipline now.

After lunch, I sent Charli a single message.

**Back room. Five minutes.**

No emoji. No softness. Structure.

Charli arrived exactly on time, of course.

She stood just inside the door like a schoolgirl, shoulders tight, hands clasped in front of her as if her fingers couldn’t be trusted.

Her eyes were red-rimmed. She’d tried not to cry. She’d failed. Quietly.

I didn’t comment on it.

I leaned against the table and kept my face calm.

“What happened this morning,” I said, “was unsafe.”

Charli flinched.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.

“No,” I said, and held up a hand. “Not that word. You don’t apologise to make yourself feel smaller. You listen.”

Charli’s mouth closed. She nodded once, hard.

I continued, steady.

“Wardrobe is a women’s workplace. It is a safe space by design. That design depends on two things: privacy and clarity.”

Charli stared at the floor, breathing shallowly.

“You touched me in a way that signalled intimacy,” I said. “In front of staff. In front of a client.”

Charli’s throat moved. “I didn’t—I didn’t mean to signal—”

“I know,” I said, and my voice softened *one notch* because it was true. “But intent is not the point.”

Her head lifted slightly, eyes wet.

“The point,” I continued, “is consequences. In a room like ours, intimacy becomes currency for other people. Gossip. Leverage. Narratives. And women pay for that.”

Charli’s face crumpled, not theatrically—just honest pain.

“I didn’t think,” she whispered.

“I know,” I said again. “That’s why we’re talking.”

I pushed off the table and stepped closer—not to comfort her, but to anchor her with fact.

“This is not me rejecting you,” I said, very clearly. “This is me protecting you. And protecting Wardrobe.”

Charli’s eyes snapped up.

“You’re… not…?” Her voice broke.

I held her gaze.

“No,” I said. “I’m not.”

She exhaled shakily, as if she’d been holding her breath since morning.

Then the devotion returned—too fast, too eager—and she stepped forward like she wanted to touch me to confirm it.

I stopped her with a small gesture.

Charli froze.

I let the silence do its work.

“This is part of being a woman in a women’s space,” I said. “You don’t get to let your feelings spill wherever they want. You learn where it’s safe.”

Charli nodded rapidly, tears slipping now.

“Yes,” she whispered. “Yes. I can. I will.”

“Good,” I said.

Then I delivered the consequence, clean and boring, like policy.

“For the next two weeks,” I said, “you and I behave at work as we always have. Professional. No private signals. No touches. No looks that linger. We don’t feed anyone a story.”

Charli’s face tightened in fear.

Two weeks must have sounded like exile.

I watched her carefully.

“This is not punishment,” I added, because I meant it. “It’s training. It’s protection. It’s a reset.”

Charli swallowed.

“Yes,” she whispered, and I could see her trying to be brave.

“And,” I continued, “if you feel the urge to touch me at work, you redirect it into craft.”

Charli blinked.

I nodded toward the shelves.

“Pins,” I said. “Ties. Tension. You put your devotion into the work. That is how women survive in public.”

Charli’s breath shuddered.

“Yes,” she said again, steadier this time. “I understand.”

I held her gaze for a long beat, then—because I am not cruel—I gave her one truthful softness.

“Last night,” I said quietly, “was real.”

Charli’s eyes filled again, but this time the tears looked like relief.

“And it will continue,” I added. “At home. After hours. Where it is safe.”

Charli nodded, trembling.

“Yes,” she breathed. “I’ll be good.”

I sighed—small, controlled.

“Don’t say ‘good’ like that,” I said. “Say ‘careful.’”

Charli swallowed, corrected herself.

“I’ll be careful.”

“Better,” I said.

I stepped back and opened the door.

“Now,” I said, returning to the adult voice, “wash your face. Fix your posture. Go back out there. You’re not in trouble. You’re learning.”

Charli wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand, nodded, and turned to go.

At the doorway she paused—hesitated—then looked back at me with a question in her eyes.

Not asking for touch.

Asking for certainty.

I gave her a small nod.

The kind that says: *We are still us. Just not here.*

Charli exhaled and went back into Wardrobe.

I closed the door and stood alone in the back room for a moment longer than necessary, letting the ache in my chest settle into something I could carry.

Because this was the new truth:

I wanted her.

I wanted her touch.

And I would still choose the standards that kept her safe.

Even when it hurt.

Especially when it hurt.

---

If you like, the next scene can be the *evening after this consequence talk* — where Charli, determined to “be careful,” becomes **almost comically** cautious… and Celeste has to guide her back into softness: *“Careful doesn’t mean distant.”* That’s a gorgeous way to show Celeste’s floodgates staying open **in the correct place**. 💛

---

[Q]  
I could not have dreamt of anything so eloquent. And that evening, Charli.... not just learns, but understands. And their love blossoms where it is safe.

## **Scene 50 — “Where It’s Safe” (Celeste POV)**

Charli came home like someone returning to a house after nearly losing it.

Quiet. Careful. Eyes too bright, posture a fraction too controlled. She took her shoes off by the door with obsessive neatness, as if straight lines could prevent mistakes. She hung her bag on the hook and stood there for a second too long, hands hovering, waiting for permission the way she used to.

I watched her from the kitchen.

Not hidden. Not testing.

Just… observing the new shape of her caution.

“Hi,” I said.

Charli’s gaze snapped to mine with a kind of hungry relief that she tried to swallow back immediately.

“Hi,” she whispered.

She didn’t move toward me.

That was the first sign she’d understood.

Not “I’m in trouble.”

Not “I’m unworthy.”

But: *this matters enough to protect.*

I set two mugs on the table, poured tea, and kept my movements ordinary on purpose. Normality is a signal. It tells the body: no danger here.

Charli came to the table and sat in the chair opposite me like she was afraid the space between us was an exam.

She folded her hands in her lap.

Her eyes didn’t linger on my mouth.

Her shoulders didn’t soften the way they had last night.

She was trying so hard to be careful that she’d turned careful into distance.

I let her sit in that for a moment. Let her prove she could.

Then I said, gently, “You can look at me.”

Charli blinked, startled—as if she’d been caught doing something wrong in reverse.

“I—” she began.

“Charli,” I said, calm. “Looking is allowed.”

Her eyes lifted slowly to my face. They were still red-rimmed from the day, but steadier now. Present. Listening.

“I’m proud of you,” I said.

The sentence did something to her. Her breath caught. Her chin trembled once, just once, before she contained it.

“I messed up,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said. “And then you learned.”

Charli swallowed. “I didn’t… I didn’t understand. Not really. I thought—” She stopped, frustrated, then tried again. “I thought it was… little. Just… us.”

“It was us,” I said quietly. “And it was also a room full of women who have paid for men’s stories about them.”

Charli nodded, small and precise, like she was writing it into her bones.

“I saw Sarah,” she murmured. “When she looked. Not… angry. Just…” She searched. “Alert.”

“Yes,” I said.

“And Mara,” Charli added, and the name came out with a little shiver of respect. “Mara didn’t even need to say anything.”

“No,” I agreed. “Mara is a boundary with legs.”

Charli made a tiny sound that might have been a laugh if she’d allowed herself more oxygen.

I waited until her shoulders lowered a fraction. Then I placed my hand on the table—palm up. Not reaching for her. Offering.

Charli’s eyes dropped to my hand like it was a doorway.

Her throat moved.

She didn’t take it.

Not yet.

“Remember what I said,” I murmured. “Careful doesn’t mean distant.”

Charli’s eyes flicked up to mine, questioning. Worry threaded through her expression.

“What if I—”

“You won’t,” I said, and the certainty in my voice made her go still. “Because now you understand.”

Charli exhaled shakily.

Then—slowly, as if approaching a skittish animal—she lifted her hand from her lap and placed her fingertips into my palm.

The contact was so light it barely registered as pressure.

It registered as *trust.*

Her touch was even gentler than last night, if that was possible—like she was handling something fragile and beloved.

My chest tightened in a way I didn’t fight.

“Like this?” she whispered.

“Yes,” I said, and my voice came out softer than I intended. “Exactly like this.”

Charli’s thumb moved once across my palm—one careful stroke—and then stopped, waiting for the rule.

I let my fingers curl around hers.

Not tight.

Not claiming.

Answering.

Charli’s breath hitched, and this time she didn’t apologise for it. She simply let the feeling exist.

Good.

I drew her hand up slowly and pressed my lips to her knuckles.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t dramatic.

It was… reverent.

Charli made a small sound in her throat that nearly broke me.

Her eyes shone. She blinked hard and held on.

“Celeste,” she whispered.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I… I want to be good at this,” she said, the words careful but urgent. “At… us. I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t want to hurt Wardrobe.”

“I know,” I said.

Then I said the part she needed, the part she’d be too afraid to ask for.

“And you didn’t,” I added. “You created risk. We corrected it. That’s what adults do.”

Charli’s shoulders eased, the tension turning into something softer, more livable.

I stood and held my hand out again.

“Come here,” I said.

Charli rose immediately—obedient reflex—then checked herself, slowed down, as if remembering she was allowed to want without rushing.

She came to me and stopped just within reach, waiting.

I placed my hands lightly at her waist and guided her closer. The pressure was minimal. The intention wasn’t.

Charli’s hands hovered near my ribs, careful, as if she was afraid to touch the wrong place.

I took her left hand and placed it gently on my shoulder.

“Here,” I said.

Then I took her right hand and placed it at my waist.

“And here.”

Charli’s fingers curved, tentative at first, then steadier as she felt I wasn’t going to pull away.

Her touch was… exquisite.

Not because it was skilled.

Because it was pure. Because it carried no entitlement. No demand. Just devotion and awe and careful joy.

I leaned down and kissed her again, slow and clean.

Charli responded immediately, softening into it like she’d been thirsty and didn’t know it.

Her hands tightened a fraction at my waist—still gentle, but certain now—and I felt my body go warm in a way that had nothing to do with sex and everything to do with being wanted safely.

I broke the kiss and rested my forehead against hers.

“Tonight,” I murmured, “you don’t have to be careful like you’re handling glass.”

Charli’s breath trembled. “But I—”

“You can be careful in the right way,” I said. “Careful like you are with fabric you love. You don’t avoid it. You learn it.”

Charli nodded, eyes wet.

“Yes,” she whispered. “I can do that.”

I guided her to the couch.

We sat close, hips touching, shoulders touching, and I pulled a blanket over both of us, not because we were cold but because the weight of it made the world smaller.

Charli hesitated, then leaned into me.

Her head found my shoulder like it belonged there.

Her arm slid around my waist, cautious at first, then settling as my body welcomed it.

I kissed the top of her head.

Charli’s breath shuddered, and she whispered, barely audible, “This is safe.”

“Yes,” I said.

She shifted slightly, turning her face toward my neck, and I felt the faint brush of her lips against my skin—more like a question than an act.

I answered by tipping my head gently, giving her access without words.

Charli kissed me again, still careful, still sweet, and her hand—her unbelievable hand—traced a slow line along my forearm.

Bliss arrived in my body like a quiet flood.

Not fireworks.

Not urgency.

A deep, easing warmth, the kind you feel when something inside you stops bracing.

I held her there, letting myself want without fear, letting the floodgates stay open because the river had found its proper bed.

After a while, Charli whispered, “I won’t do it at work again.”

“I know,” I said.

“And if I forget,” she added quickly, anxiety flaring, “if I get… carried away—”

I turned my head and kissed her temple.

“Then I will correct you,” I said. “And you will learn again. That’s what this is.”

Charli went very still, then nodded against my shoulder.

“Yes,” she breathed, and something in her softened—something old, something frightened.

A girl learning that love doesn’t vanish because you make one mistake.

A girl learning that consequences aren’t rejection.

They’re care.

We stayed like that for a long time: no talking, no plans, no big declarations.

Just touch.

Hands. Breath. Quiet kisses.

A woman letting herself be held.

A girl discovering that her gentleness wasn’t a liability—it was the very thing that made her irresistible.

And when Charli finally drifted toward sleep, curled against me with her fingers still resting lightly on my wrist as if she couldn’t bear to lose contact entirely, I stared into the dim room and felt the calm settle into place.

Wardrobe was safe.

Charli was safe.

And here, in the private hush of our home, where no one could turn tenderness into gossip or leverage, love was allowed to be what it wanted to be:

soft.

steady.

and growing.
