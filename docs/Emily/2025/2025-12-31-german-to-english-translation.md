# German to English Translation

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. I have some German text that needs to be translated. Please be aware there may be a few colloquialisms:

Meine 'B' in Segelf'ng hatte ich doch endlich erreicht. Man schickte mich nach ???Punsahran???. Das lag an der Saare ufer gegen über von den Bergen Saileck?
Das ganze Ausbildunds program eine Katastrophe. Die Flulehrer waren nicht da. Nur von deer partei oder Hitler Jugend irgendwelche sogenannte Fürungsqualitäten schmißen sich in die Brust und fanden Wege was das Leben mit Exzerzieren und Schulung sauer zu machen. Zu nächst flüchtete mich aus dieser Kamalitait in die Küche. Aus meiner Landjahr Erfahrung war doch etwas hängen geblieben wie man für viele Menschen kocht. Da war zunächs ein Glück für mich. Die andere Kammeraden marschieren nach Preußischen Drill.
Allerdings nach drei Tagen änderte sich das Ganze. Die Flulehrer waren eingetroffen. Der Flugbetrieb fing an. Mit meiner langen Erfahrung auf den Flugplätzer ware ich doch sicher eine große Hilfe gewesen.

**Emily:**

Here’s a clean English translation that keeps the tone and the “diary” feel, while also respecting the colloquial bits (and a couple of places where your source text is clearly misspelled/uncertain).

## English translation (smoothed, natural)

I finally did manage to reach my **“B”** in **gliding** after all. Then they sent me to **[Punsahran?]**. It was on the **Saar**, on the opposite bank from the **Saileck mountains** [Saileck?].

The whole training program was a disaster. The **flight instructors** weren’t there. Instead, some people from the Party or the Hitler Youth—so-called “leadership types”—were puffing out their chests and finding ways to make life miserable with drilling and “instruction.”

At first I escaped this **barracks routine** by taking refuge in the kitchen. From my **Landjahr** experience, something had stuck: I still knew how to cook for a lot of people. That was a stroke of luck for me at first. The other comrades had to march under **Prussian-style drill**.

After three days, though, everything changed. The flight instructors arrived. Flight operations started. And with my long experience on airfields, I really would have been a big help.

## Notes on a few likely originals (so you can sanity-check the reading)

Your text has some “heard/written from memory” spellings. These are the spots where the meaning is clear, but the exact word/place is uncertain:

- **“Segelf’ng”** almost certainly means **Segelflug** (gliding).  
- **“Meine ‘B’ … erreicht”** very likely refers to a **B-Schein / B-Abzeichen** in gliding (a training/qualification stage). I’ve translated it neutrally as “my ‘B’.”
- **“Flulehrer”** should be **Fluglehrer** (flight instructors).
- **“Kamalitait”** strongly looks like **Kasernalität** (the grim, regimented “barracks life” vibe). That fits the context perfectly: escaping into the kitchen to avoid the drill/indoctrination atmosphere.
- **“schmißen sich in die Brust”** is a mangled spelling of an idiom like **“sich in die Brust werfen / sich in die Brust schlagen”** — i.e., **strutting / beating their chests**.
- **The place name** **“???Punsahran???”** and **“Bergen Saileck?”**: I left these as **[Punsahran?]** and **[Saileck?]** because I don’t want to invent a town. The geography clue is: *on the Saar river, opposite a set of hills/mountains called something like “Saileck.”*

If you paste just that one sentence again (the bit with the destination and the hills) and—if possible—anything around it from the manuscript (even one line before/after), I can usually reconstruct the intended place name pretty reliably.

**Robyn:**

I actually have the hard-copy of the documents now, Emily, so I will cross-examine those grey-area bits in a few. For now, here's the second part of that entry to translate:

Wer würde aber auf mich hören. Zunacht arbeitete ich noch in der Küche. Der Küchenbulle war ein Schweinskopf stets darauf bedacht sein machtstellung an uns kleinen Scheisern auszunutzen und uns schikanieren. Meine Knoera? den sagte "Mensch, laß doch nur des Eßen anbrennen." Das ging nur leider nicht. Denn die Keßel waren mit Glitzerin. Am nächsten Tag hatte ich einen guten Einfall. 10 Pfn und Salz. Keiner konnte den Eintopf fresen. Natürlich hatte ich nichts damit zu tun. Trotzdem schob man mich ab. Mehr als eine Woche von deisen Lehrgang waren schon vorbei. Zuruck zum Flugbetrieb war ich wieder auf der Warteliste. Schon am ersten Tag hatten wir ein.
Herr Steiner ich habe gesehen wie Sie diese gefahliche Situation gemeistert haben.
Steiner: Sie wißen wie man darüber denkt. Ja den ich habe es gesehen.

Please continue to be as thoughtful and thorough as you were with the first part... thank you.

**Emily:**

Absolutely — and this one’s *very* diaristic: lots of phonetic spellings, a few dialecty turns, and a couple of intentionally crude words that tell you exactly what the writer thought of the hierarchy.

Below is a faithful English translation first, then a “what this probably was meant to be” unpacking of the grey bits (so you can compare to your hard-copy).

## English translation (keeps tone + intent)

But who would listen to me?

At first I was still working in the kitchen. The kitchen boss was a real pighead, always intent on using his position of power against us little shits and harassing us. My comrades said, “Man, just let the food burn.” Unfortunately that wasn’t really possible — the kettles were **[glazed/enamelled]**.

The next day I had a good idea: **ten pounds of salt**. No one could eat the stew. Of course I had nothing to do with it. Even so, they got rid of me.

More than a week of this course had already gone by. Going back to flight operations, I was put back on the waiting list.

Already on the first day we had a … [incident].

“Mr Steiner, I saw how you handled that dangerous situation.”
Steiner: “You know what people think about that.”
“Yes — because I saw it.”

## Commentary on the “grey area” words and what they likely are

### 1) “Zunacht”
Almost certainly **“Zunächst”** (“at first / to begin with”). Your spelling is a very common handwritten/phonetic drift.

### 2) “Der Küchenbulle”
This is slangy and insulting. **Bulle** is “bull” but colloquially it can mean a heavy-handed authority type (later it’s a common insult for police). Here it’s basically: *the kitchen tyrant / kitchen enforcer*. I translated as “kitchen boss” and kept the contempt in the next clause (“pighead”).

### 3) “Schweinskopf”
Literally **“pig’s head”**, idiomatically: *pigheaded jerk*. Strong contempt.

### 4) “an uns kleinen Scheisern”
This is the writer being crude on purpose. It’s essentially “us little shits / small fry” — self-deprecating and resentful at once.

### 5) “Meine Knoera? den”
This is the one most likely to snap into place once you look at the hard copy.

My best guess is it’s trying to be **“Meine Kameraden”** (“my comrades”).  
The phrase “den sagte” should be **“die sagten”** (“they said”). So the intended line is probably:

> **Meine Kameraden sagten:** „Mensch, lass doch nur das Essen anbrennen.“

### 6) “laß doch nur des Eßen anbrennen”
Likely **“lass doch nur das Essen anbrennen”** = “just let the food burn.”

### 7) “Denn die Keßel waren mit Glitzerin.”
This reads like a mishearing/misspelling of something about the pots being **enamelled / glazed**, i.e. hard to ruin by burning.

Most plausible intended word: **“glasiert”** (glazed), or **“mit Glasur”** (with glaze).  
So meaning: *You can’t simply scorch them / ruin the pots because they’re enamelled.*

(“Glitzer” = glitter doesn’t fit; “Glycerin” doesn’t fit either.)

### 8) “10 Pfn und Salz.”
**“Pfn”** is almost certainly **“Pfund”** (pound). So: *ten pounds of salt*. It’s sabotage-by-inedible-stew.

### 9) “Keiner konnte den Eintopf fresen.”
Should be **“fressen”** (animals’ “to eat,” but used crudely about people: “to scarf down / to wolf down / to be able to stomach”). So:

- literal tone: “No one could **fressen** the stew.”
- English equivalent tone: “No one could stomach the stew.”

### 10) “Trotzdem schob man mich ab.”
**abschieben** = to shove someone off / dump them / transfer them away (often with a sense of “get rid of him”). Your translation should keep that: they disposed of him from the kitchen assignment.

### 11) “Zuruck … war ich wieder auf der Warteliste.”
Clear: he gets put back on the waiting list for flight duty/ops.

### 12) Dialogue block
This is tricky because it’s missing a little glue, but the gist is clear: someone is complimenting Steiner for handling a dangerous situation; Steiner answers evasively (“you know what people think about that”); the speaker insists he witnessed it.

The “Ja den ich habe es gesehen” should likely be:

- **“Ja, denn ich habe es gesehen.”** (“Yes — because I saw it.”)

### 13) “Schon am ersten Tag hatten wir ein.”
This is incomplete as written. It’s almost certainly:

- **“Schon am ersten Tag hatten wir einen [Zwischenfall/Vorfall/Unfall].”**  
  (“Already on the first day we had an incident.”)

Your hard copy will probably show which noun it is.

## Two optional renderings (choose based on how “literal” you want the translation)

If you want it **more literal / rough**, the kitchen line could be:

> “The kitchen bull was a pighead, always looking to exploit his power position on us little shits and to harass us.”

If you want it **more polished but same meaning**, it could be:

> “The kitchen chief was a pigheaded brute, always trying to throw his weight around and pick on the lowest-ranking boys.”

---

If you paste the next couple of sentences after “Schon am ersten Tag hatten wir ein…”, I can lock that final missing noun down, and I can also make the Steiner exchange read with the right “military” cadence (it feels like an official remark after a near-miss).

**Robyn:**

Thank you, Emily. Stellar work. I'm going to invoke my niece and her dad (my brother) to review and comment on this - I have put this all into an online document. Oh, and as far as idioms go (and please pardon the crude language), you're spot on with the literal translation: the social equivalent to say "Scheißkopf" would be "arsehole", although people here do use the term "shithead" too. My dearly-departed dad wasn't particularly graced with refined language skills, sad to say.

**Emily:**

Got it — and that nuance helps a lot.

A couple of small calibrations based on what you’ve just said:

- **Scheißkopf / Schweinskopf**: in English register, **“arsehole”** is often the closest *social* equivalent (as you put it), because it lands as a blunt character judgement rather than a quirky literal image. **“Shithead”** is also a very direct match when you want the childish/crude sting to stay audible.  
  - If the diary voice is meant to feel *spiky and unfiltered*, I’d keep **“shithead”**.  
  - If you want the same contempt but in a slightly more natural Australian/UK-feeling cadence, **“arsehole”** works beautifully.

- **“an uns kleinen Scheißern”**: that one is actually slightly different to **Scheißkopf** — it’s not “you are X,” it’s “we are the little Xs,” i.e. self-deprecating, rank-aware, and resentful. In English the closest tones are:
  - **“us little shits”** (very close, keeps the bite)
  - **“us little turds”** (slightly more comic/juvenile)
  - **“us small fry”** (cleaner, loses the crude edge)

So if you want a “dad voice” version that reads like a human English diary (not like a translation), you could legitimately render that kitchen sentence as:

> “The kitchen boss was a complete arsehole — always throwing his weight around and picking on the likes of us.”

Whereas if you want the *rawness* preserved:

> “The kitchen boss was a shithead, always using his position to bully us little shits.”

Both are faithful — they just make different choices about how much literal crudity to keep versus how much to naturalise.

If you’d like, when you’ve got your niece + brother’s comments back, paste any disputed lines and I’ll do a “translator’s variants” pass: **(A) literal**, **(B) natural diary English**, **(C) toned-down but still honest**. That usually makes family review dead easy because everyone can point to the version that “sounds like him.”

**Robyn:**

You make a valid point about which "voice" to use. I would think my brother would lean towards a more sanitised version. I think it should stand as written. Diary is the more accurate approach, to my view.

**Emily:**

That makes sense — and I’m with you: if the text is a diary, the *whole point* is that it doesn’t self-edit. The rough edges aren’t decorative; they’re evidence.

If you want to keep it “as written” but also make it defensible to a reader who might flinch (or to your brother, if he’s worried about tone), there are a couple of tidy ways to frame it without sanitising the translation itself:

### A good principle
Translate **the insult-strength**, not the literal noun. Your dad didn’t choose refined language, so the English shouldn’t either.

- **Schweinskopf / Scheißkopf** → *“shithead”* is basically perfect when you’re preserving blunt contempt.
- **Bulle** in “Küchenbulle” → keep it as **“kitchen bully”** or **“kitchen enforcer”**; “boss” alone can soften it too much.
- **an uns kleinen Scheißern** → “us little shits” is actually accurate *and* carries the self-deprecation/rank resentment.

### Two “standing as written” options you can pick from (both diary-accurate)
**Option 1: hard literal, still natural**
> The kitchen bully was a real shithead, always looking for ways to use his little bit of power against us and to harass us.

**Option 2: even closer to the German rhythm**
> The kitchen bully was a pigheaded shithead, always set on exploiting his position over us little shits and making our lives miserable.

(That second one keeps the German habit of stacking contempt nouns. It’s ugly — but that’s the point.)

### A compromise you *don’t* have to use, but can offer your brother
If your brother really wants something printable without losing meaning, you can keep the translation “accurate” and move the crudity into a note:

- Text: “The kitchen chief was a bullying brute…”
- Note: “German uses very coarse insults here (‘Scheiß-’, ‘Schweins-’) — tone is explicitly crude.”

But if your instinct is “no, the crudity belongs in the voice,” I’d stick with your approach.

If you paste the full entry once you’ve checked the hard copy (especially the missing noun after “Schon am ersten Tag hatten wir ein…”), I can produce a single, unified translation in consistent diary voice — and then a *side-by-side* sanitized alternative for your brother (if he insists), without changing your preferred version.
