# Character LoRA dataset plan

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. I need some help with FluxGym. I wish to create a character LoRA. How should I plan my dataset and caption strategy?

**Emily:**

Hey Robyn! Great project. Here’s a solid, no-drama plan to get a clean, controllable **character LoRA** out of FluxGym.

# 1) Decide what the LoRA should learn (and what it must **not**)
- **Lock in**: face, head shape, eye color/shape, hair color/length/part, skin tone, key moles/scars/freckles, eyebrows, typical makeup (if you want it baked in).
- **Keep flexible**: clothes, background, pose, camera/lens, lighting, mood, accessories—unless you *want* those to be part of the identity.
- Make a one-line goal you’ll refer to while captioning:  
  “`[celestegrl]` = petite 18-20yo woman, heart-shaped face, hazel eyes, dark chest-length hair, soft freckles, natural makeup.”

# 2) Dataset size & mix (sweet spot for a character)
Aim for **60–120 images** total. Curate hard—quality beats quantity.

**Coverage targets**
- **Face-centric closeups (40–50%)**: straight on, 3/4, profile. Neutral and varied expressions.
- **Torso/half-body (30–40%)**: ensure neck/shoulders consistency, hair length visible.
- **Full-body (10–20%)**: establish body proportions; a few walking/standing/sitting.
- **Hands (5–10%)**: a few images where hands are visible but not the star.
- **Lighting**: day, overcast, soft indoor, one or two “hard light” shots—no single look should dominate.
- **Backgrounds**: mostly plain or de-cluttered. Include a handful of busy scenes so the model learns to ignore them.
- **Wardrobe**: *varied*. If you don’t want a pink hoodie stuck to the LoRA forever, make sure it appears in ≤5% of images—or not at all.

**What to avoid**
- Sunglasses covering eyes, masks, heavy occlusions.
- Text/logos near face.
- Repetitive near-dupes (same pose/lighting/shirt).

# 3) Image prep
- **Resolution**: train buckets up to **1024** (Flux is comfy there). Keep sources ≥1024 on the shortest side; don’t upscale aggressively.
- **Cropping**: deliver both loose and tight crops; avoid cutting off chins/foreheads consistently—vary it.
- **Horizontal flips**: only if the face is symmetric and the character has **no asymmetric features** (part line, mole, earring). Otherwise, **don’t flip**.
- **Color**: gentle white-balance and exposure normalization are good; don’t stylize.

# 4) Trigger token strategy
- Use **one unique trigger** that will *never* appear in normal text, e.g. **`[celestegrl]`** (you already use this pattern—perfect).
- Pair it with a **class token** in captions, e.g. “woman”, “girl”, “person”, “portrait”. For Flux, **natural language** tends to work better than tag-soup.

# 5) Captioning: what to put in (and what to leave out)
Flux responds beautifully to **short, natural sentences**. Think **15–40 tokens** each.

**Template**
```
[celestegrl], portrait of a petite young woman with hazel eyes and chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, natural makeup, gentle smile, studio lighting, neutral background.
```
- Start with the trigger.
- Add **only** the traits you want the LoRA to learn as identity.
- Then add **scene/photography** descriptors (lighting, lensy words, background) to teach generalization—but don’t repeat the *same* scene terms on every image.

**When clothes/features should stay flexible**
- If you *don’t* want the LoRA to memorize the yellow cardigan, **omit it** from the caption. If it’s very visible in many images, mention generic “casual outfit” instead of “yellow cardigan”.

**Pose/shot words**
- Sprinkle across the set: “headshot”, “close-up”, “three-quarter view”, “profile”, “full body, standing”.

**Good caption examples**
- “`[celestegrl], natural light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, slight smile, shallow depth of field.`”
- “`[celestegrl], three-quarter view portrait, neutral background, relaxed expression.`”
- “`[celestegrl], full body, standing, casual outfit, outdoor overcast light.`”

**What not to do**
- Don’t stuff every caption with *all* traits (teaches the model those traits only work together).
- Don’t include changeable things you don’t want baked in (specific shirt colors, accessories, scene themes).
- Avoid long laundry-lists of tags; Flux likes prose.

# 6) Class/regularization images (optional but helpful)
- Add **100–200 generic “woman/person portrait”** images without your trigger token in a separate class folder if FluxGym supports prior-preservation.
- This reduces style drift and helps your LoRA not overwrite base concepts. Keep their captions simple (no trigger).

# 7) Repeats, epochs, and steps (ballpark)
Let **N** = number of instance images. A practical recipe:
- **N ≈ 80** images
- **Repeats**: 10
- **Batch**: 4
- **Epochs**: 1–2

**Steps ≈ (N × repeats × epochs) / batch**  
For 80×10×1 / 4 = **200 steps** per epoch.  
For character identity, expect **800–2500 total steps** to find the sweet spot (save checkpoints along the way: e.g., 600, 1200, 1800, 2400) and compare.

# 8) Training knobs that tend to work (Flux-ish defaults)
- **Rank (dim)**: 16–32 (start at **16**; bump to 32 if you see underfitting).
- **Alpha**: = rank (e.g., 16).
- **Dropout**: 0.05–0.1 if you notice overfitting to clothes/backgrounds.
- **Learning rates**  
  - **UNet**: **1e-4 → 2e-4**  
  - **Text encoder**: **5e-6 → 1e-5** (keep low; raises binding to `[celestegrl]` without wrecking the base text space)
- **Optimizer**: AdamW, weight decay ~0.01.
- **Bucket max res**: 1024; enable aspect-buckets.
- **Gradient checkpointing** if VRAM is tight.

# 9) Validation (don’t skip)
Hold out **6–10 images** (never seen in training). After each checkpoint:
- Prompt with/without the class token:
  - “`portrait of [celestegrl], soft daylight, natural makeup`”
  - “`[celestegrl] walking on a beach, golden hour`”
- Try clothing the LoRA never saw (“evening dress”, “hoodie”), different hair styles, and varied lighting to test generalization.
- Compare checkpoints side-by-side and pick the lowest step that nails identity **without** freezing wardrobe/lighting.

# 10) Common failure modes & fixes
- **Overfitting to one outfit/background** → reduce duplicates, add variety, add dropout 0.1, add class images, remove clothing terms from captions.
- **Face not locking / looks generic** → add more tight face crops with precise face traits in captions; slightly raise TE LR; increase repeats to 12.
- **Identity drifts under complex prompts** → ensure *every* caption starts with the trigger; include several neutral “vanilla” portraits; consider bumping rank from 16→32.
- **Mirrored mole/part line after flips** → remove flipped images; retrain.

# 11) Practical workflow you can copy
1. Curate 90 images → prune to the best **75–90**.  
2. Sort into subfolders: `closeup/`, `halfbody/`, `fullbody/`, `hands/`.  
3. Write **short prose captions** (sidecar `.txt` per image). Start with `[celestegrl]`.  
4. (Optional) Add `class/` folder with 150 generic woman portraits + simple captions.  
5. Train at 1024 buckets, rank 16, UNet 1e-4, TE 5e-6, batch 4, repeats 10, 1–2 epochs.  
6. Save checkpoints every ~400–600 steps.  
7. Validate with a fixed prompt sheet; pick the *lowest* step that passes identity + flexibility.

If you want, I can draft a **caption starter pack** for your first 20 images (you can paste the filenames), or a **prompt sheet** to evaluate checkpoints consistently.

**Robyn:**

A quick question about datasets, Emily. Is it advisable to include images of different dimensions? As in: can you combine 1024 x 1024 px images with 1216 x 832 px images? What about resolution (dpi)?

**Emily:**

Great question, Robyn!

Short version: **Yes, mix dimensions; DPI doesn’t matter.** A few gotchas below.

# Dimensions / aspect ratios
- **It’s fine (and good) to mix** 1024×1024 with 1216×832, 896×1152, etc.  
- In FluxGym, just **enable aspect-ratio buckets** and set a **max bucket size** (commonly 1024 or 1152 on the long side, depending on VRAM). The trainer will resize each image into the nearest bucket.
- **Avoid padding/letterboxing.** Give the trainer real pixels, not black bars. Crop instead of pad.
- **Keep subject scale consistent.** Even with buckets, don’t swing from extreme tight headshots to tiny faces in wide scenes. Aim for a coherent face size range across images (you can still keep some variety).
- **Don’t aggressively upscale** tiny sources to huge buckets—mild upscales are okay, but big ones add mushy detail and can teach artifacts.

# DPI / PPI
- **Completely irrelevant.** Training uses raw pixel counts; DPI metadata is ignored. A 1024×1024 at 72 dpi and the same at 300 dpi are identical to the trainer.

# Practical tips
- **Set max bucket**: 1024 (safe) or 1152 (more detail, more VRAM).  
- **Minimum shortest side**: try to keep sources ≥768 px on the short side; delete or down-weight smaller ones.  
- **Face framing**: for character LoRA, ensure ~40–60% of images have the face occupying ~35–70% of the frame.  
- **No letterbox**: If you must normalize, **crop** to the desired aspect rather than adding borders.  
- **VRAM awareness**: Wider/taller buckets (e.g., 1216×832) cost more memory than 1024×1024; pick a ceiling your GPU can handle.

If you want, tell me your GPU VRAM and I’ll suggest a max-bucket and batch size that won’t OOM, plus a quick crop recipe to keep face scale tidy across mixed aspect ratios.

**Robyn:**

I have an NVidia (Gigabyte) 4060ti, with 16 gig of VRAM. How is this going to affect my dataset, Emily?

**Emily:**

Got it, Robyn — a **4060 Ti 16 GB** is a sweet spot for LoRA training. Here’s how it should shape your dataset and settings:

# What this GPU means for your dataset
- **You can keep mixed aspect ratios** (e.g., 1024×1024 with 1216×832) and use **aspect-ratio buckets**. No need to force everything square.
- You can comfortably train at **max bucket 1024**; **1152** is also realistic if you keep batch sensible. Only drop big panoramic outliers that make faces tiny.
- **No need to downscale good sources**: keep images ≥**900–1024 px** on the short side when possible. Crop instead of letterbox.

# Recommended trainer settings (LoRA on Flux/SDXL-class models)
**Memory/precision**
- **Mixed precision**: **bf16** (preferred) or fp16.
- **Memory-efficient attention**: enable **Flash-Attention/xFormers** if FluxGym exposes it.
- **Gradient checkpointing**: **ON** (cuts VRAM nicely).

**Resolution & buckets**
- **Max bucket**: start **1024**; try **1152** if stable.  
- **Min bucket short side**: 768.  
- **Keep buckets** around these: 832×1216, 896×1152, 1024×1024, 1152×896 (trainer usually auto-makes them).

**Batching (typical for 16 GB)**
- At **1024 max**: **batch 4–6** (start **4**; raise if stable).  
- At **1152 max**: **batch 2–4** (start **3**).  
- If you want a larger *effective* batch, use **gradient accumulation** (e.g., batch 3 × grad-accum 2 ⇒ effective 6).

**Other handy toggles**
- **Cache latents** (if offered) to boost throughput after the first epoch.
- **Workers**: 4–8 (watch CPU/RAM).
- **Shuffle**: ON.

# Training recipe that fits 16 GB (character LoRA)
- **Rank (dim)**: 16 (32 if underfitting).  
- **Alpha**: same as rank.  
- **Dropout**: 0.05–0.1 if it memorizes clothes/backgrounds.  
- **LRs**: UNet **1e-4** (up to 2e-4), Text Encoder **5e-6** (up to 1e-5).  
- **Repeats**: 10, **Epochs**: 1–2, **Batch**: as above.  
- **Checkpoints** every **400–600** steps.

# Dataset curation with 16 GB in mind
- You **don’t** have to prune for VRAM—prune for **identity clarity**:
  - Aim **60–120 images**, with **40–50% closeups**, **30–40% half-body**, **10–20% full-body**.
  - Keep **face scale** within a sensible band (avoid lots of ultra-wide shots with tiny faces).
  - Keep **occlusions low** (no sunglasses/masks dominating).
- Keep **mixed lighting** and **varied outfits** so your LoRA generalizes; your GPU can handle the bucket variety.

# Two plug-and-play profiles

**Comfort (fast & stable)**
- Max bucket **1024**, batch **4**, bf16, checkpointing ON, Flash-Attn ON.  
- Rank 16, UNet 1e-4, TE 5e-6, repeats 10, 1–2 epochs.

**Detail (more capacity, a tad slower)**
- Max bucket **1152**, batch **3**, bf16, checkpointing ON, Flash-Attn ON.  
- Rank 16→32 (if needed), UNet 1.2e-4, TE 7e-6, repeats 10, 1–2 epochs.

# Quick troubleshooting tied to VRAM
- **OOM at 1152** → drop batch by 1, or switch to max 1024, or enable grad-accum 2.  
- **Training too slow** → stick to 1024 max; enable latent caching; trim bucket list to a few common shapes.  
- **Identity wobbles** at higher res → keep 1024 max, add a few more tight face crops with crisp captions.

If you want, tell me whether you prefer the **Comfort** or **Detail** profile and I’ll spit out a ready-to-paste FluxGym config plus a tiny “bucket sanity” checklist for your image folder.

**Robyn:**

I might start with the comfort profile, Emily.

**Emily:**

Brilliant, Robyn — here’s a **ready-to-paste Comfort profile** plus a quick **bucket sanity** checklist so you can roll right in FluxGym.

# FluxGym config (Comfort profile, 4060 Ti 16 GB)

**Save as `config.yaml` (edit the paths and trigger/class tokens to taste):**
```yaml
# --- DATA ---
train_data:
  instance_dir: /path/to/dataset/instance          # your character images

    - "[celestegrl] walking on a beach, golden hour"
    - "[celestegrl], full body standing, evening dress, studio light"
```

**Rule-of-thumb steps (for ~80 images × repeats 10 × epochs 1, batch 4):** ~200 steps per epoch chunk; expect best checkpoints between **600–1800** steps. Keep the lowest step that nails identity **without** baking in outfits.

---

# Bucket sanity checklist (quick pre-flight)

- **Mix of aspects OK**: 1024×1024, 1216×832, 896×1152 etc. are fine (no letterboxes).
- **Shortest side ≥ 768 px** for most images; toss the tiny, blurry ones.
- **Face scale band**: in ~50% of images, face occupies ~35–70% of frame (avoid lots of tiny faces).
- **No near-dupes**: same pose/lighting/outfit culled down to 1–2 best.
- **Minimal occlusion**: no sunglasses/masks dominating; eyes visible in most closeups.
- **Varied lighting/outfits**: keep wardrobe variety so clothing doesn’t imprint.
- **No padding**: crop to aspect; do **not** add borders/black bars.
- **DPI ignored**: don’t worry about 72 vs 300 — pixels are what matter.

---

# Caption mini-template (Comfort style)
Keep them short, natural, and start with your trigger:

- `[celestegrl], natural light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, slight smile.`
- `[celestegrl], three-quarter view portrait, neutral background, relaxed expression.`
- `[celestegrl], full body, standing, casual outfit, overcast outdoor light.`

(Leave out specific clothing words unless you *want* them memorised.)

---

If you want, paste 10–15 filenames and I’ll draft the first batch of captions to match this config (face-heavy, clean, varied).

**Robyn:**

Thank you, Emily. Looks like a good place to start. I've recently been introduced to a new model: Gwen Image Edit 2509. I found a  workflow that will create a decent dataset from one image (not including text, of course). Would you have a positive prompt for this workflow to optimise the images, please?

**Emily:**

Love it, Robyn. Here’s a **clean, identity-safe positive prompt** you can drop into Gwen Image Edit 2509 to generate dataset-ready variants from a single photo. It sticks to natural language and avoids baking in clothes/backgrounds while nudging for realism and face fidelity.

**Master positive prompt**
> **[celestegrl]**, natural identity-preserving portrait, photoreal, true skin texture and pores, sharp expressive eyes, accurate facial proportions, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, **{headshot|three-quarter view|profile}**, **{soft daylight|open shade|studio softbox|window light|golden hour}**, **{neutral seamless backdrop|subtle gradient|plain wall|soft bokeh foliage}**, **{50mm look|85mm look}**, shallow depth of field (around f/2.8), balanced exposure, natural color, minimal makeup, no stylization, crisp focus, professional photographic quality

You can paste that verbatim. If your workflow supports wildcards (`{a|b|c}`), it’ll rotate **shot**, **lighting**, **background**, and **lens look** to produce controlled variety without drifting identity or baking in wardrobe. If it doesn’t, just pick one option from each set per batch/run.

If you’re training a LoRA, keep your **trigger token** up front (I used `[celestegrl]`, swap as needed).

**Robyn:**

Brilliant - that will be very helpful. One of the things I noticed in Flux (any flavour) is it generates faces, male or female, with a cleft chin, almost all the time. Despite efforts to the contrary, it also creates a rather prominent brow ridge, again, male or female, doesn't matter. Is there a way, say, in Krea or Kontext, to remove the cleft chin and brow ridge?

**Emily:**

You’re not imagining it—Flux tends to “over-carve” faces. Two fixes: (1) prompt/caption anatomy explicitly, and (2) do quick regional inpaints (Krea/Kontext) to smooth chin/brow without nuking identity.

Here’s a practical kit you can paste/use.

# 1) Prompt anatomy that *adds* softness (and negate the rest)
Use both positive *and* negative anatomy terms. (Negatives alone often aren’t enough.)

**Positive block (use 1–2 per render)**
- “rounded chin, no cleft”
- “soft, low brow ridge”
- “smooth browbone, fuller forehead”
- “delicate jawline, small mentolabial groove”
- “subtle philtrum, minimal glabellar shadow”

**Negative block (keep tight)**
- “no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no butt chin”
- “no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy supraorbital ridge”
- “no harsh nose–brow shadow, no deep glabellar crease”

**Example (Flux/Krea/Kontext)**
> **Positive:** portrait, photoreal, [celestegrl], rounded chin, soft low brow ridge, delicate jawline, smooth forehead, 85mm look, soft clamshell lighting, gentle fill, shallow depth of field  
> **Negative:** no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no harsh shadows, no heavy contrast

Tip: if your tool supports weights, lightly weight the anatomy:  
`rounded chin:1.2, soft low brow ridge:1.2, no cleft chin:1.3`.

# 2) Lighting and lens cues that *prevent* the artifacts
Clefts/ridges often appear from lighting, not just anatomy.
- **Use:** “soft clamshell lighting”, “beauty dish with diffusion”, “broad, frontal fill”, “open shade”, “window light with bounce.”  
- **Avoid:** “hard rim/key at 45°”, “split/Rembrandt lighting”, “high contrast”, “specular hotspot under lower lip.”  
- **Lens/angle:** “85mm look, eye-level camera.” (Down-lighting and wide lenses emphasize brow/chin topology.)

# 3) Krea or Kontext: fast regional inpaint
When a cleft or ridge still shows up, fix *locally*.

**Krea – Mask Edit recipe**
1. Duplicate the image (preserve seed/settings).  
2. **Mask** only the chin groove (thin vertical strip) or brow ridge area. Feather ~8–15px.  
3. **Prompt (chin):** “rounded chin, no cleft, soft skin microtexture, natural shading”  
   **Prompt (brow):** “smooth browbone, low brow ridge, fuller forehead contour, natural shadowing”  
4. **Denoise strength:** 0.35–0.55 (start at 0.45).  
5. **CFG/guidance:** slightly lower than your base (e.g., if 7.5 → 6.5).  
6. Keep the same positive/negative blocks; apply 1–2 passes max.

**Kontext – Inpaint recipe**
- Same mask approach.  
- Turn **“preserve background context”** (or similar) ON.  
- **Noise/strength:** 0.35–0.5.  
- **Steps:** a bit fewer than base gen (e.g., if 28 → 22) to avoid re-inventing the face.  
- If identity drifts, reduce strength or add your **FaceID/InstantID/Reference** control at low weight (0.2–0.35) while inpainting.

# 4) If using reference/ID guidance
FaceID/InstantID/IP-Adapter can stop the model from “inventing” geometry:
- Keep **ID weight modest** (0.25–0.45) during *full* gen so it doesn’t over-lock expression.  
- **For inpaint**, bump to ~0.4 and lower denoise; this pins identity while letting the chin/brow smooth.

# 5) Dataset & captions (for the LoRA you’ll train)
- Include **explicit positives** in captions on a few closeups: “rounded chin, no cleft”, “smooth browbone, low brow ridge.”  
- Avoid photos with **strong vertical shadow under the lower lip** (it reads as a cleft).  
- Keep **soft/flat light** in a healthy fraction of face crops so the LoRA learns that topology.

# 6) Two ready-to-paste prompt blocks

**A. Generation (preventive)**
- *Positive:* `portrait, photoreal, [celestegrl], rounded chin, soft low brow ridge, delicate jawline, smooth forehead, 85mm look, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, natural skin texture`
- *Negative:* `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no harsh shadows, no heavy contrast, no specular hotspots`

**B. Inpaint – Chin**
- *Positive:* `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`
- *Negative:* `no chin dimple, no deep vertical crease, no sharp contour`

**Inpaint – Brow**
- *Positive:* `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`
- *Negative:* `no prominent brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`

# 7) Parameter nudges that help
- **Lower CFG** a touch (e.g., 7.5 → 6–6.5): reduces “stylized chiseling.”  
- **Softer noise schedule / fewer steps** can help in inpaint passes (keeps the fix subtle).  
- **Texture add-ons** (skin-retouch/beauty LoRA) at **very low weight (0.1–0.2)** can smooth without plasticity.

If you want, ping me a problematic render (or describe the settings), and I’ll tailor a tiny, step-by-step Krea/Kontext inpaint preset for chin vs. brow so it’s a two-click fix.

**Robyn:**

I'd like to understand masking a bit better. In ComfyUI, a mask appears as a greyed-over area. The image is generally saved as a PNG. When I open the PNG in GIMP, it looks like the masked area is actually an erased area with alpha turned on. This implies to me that I could edit images in GIMP and save--with the masked (erased) area-- as PNG with alpha channel. Also, this would allow me to feather the edges of the masked region. Is that correct, so far? Anything I need to understand better?

**Emily:**

You’ve got the gist, Robyn — and yes, you can round-trip through GIMP to hand-craft (and feather) your masks. A few clarifications so nothing bites you:

# What ComfyUI is doing
- The **Mask Editor** exports a PNG **with an alpha channel** where the *transparent* area = the **masked** (to-be-edited) region. The RGB is your baseline image; **alpha encodes the mask**.
- In your workflow you then convert that alpha into a **grayscale mask tensor** (e.g., with “Mask from Alpha” / “Alpha to Mask”), and feed it to your inpaint node / KSampler.

# Editing masks in GIMP (safe workflow)
1. Open the PNG → you’ll see “erased” (transparent) where you painted the mask.
2. In **Layers**: ensure the layer has an **alpha channel** (Layer → Transparency → Add Alpha Channel).
3. **Feather/soften**: Select the masked region (or the inverse), then  
   - Select → **Feather** (8–20 px is a nice start for ~1k images), or  
   - Use **Gaussian Blur** on a dedicated **layer mask** (Layer → Mask → Add Layer Mask) for finer control.
4. Save as **PNG**. In the export dialog, it’s fine to keep **“Save color values from transparent pixels”** ON. (It matters only for later compositing; Comfy reads alpha values for the mask, not the hidden colors.)

# How ComfyUI reads it (and common gotchas)
- Use **Load Image** → **Mask from Alpha** (or equivalent) to extract the mask.
- **Black/White semantics:** many inpaint nodes expect **white = inpaint/edit**, **black = keep**. If your result behaves backwards, drop an **Invert Mask** node.
- **Match sizes:** masks should match the **latent/image size** you’re sampling at. If they don’t, use **Resize Mask** to your latent resolution (or enable the node that resizes masks automatically).
- **No letterboxing:** avoid padded borders in your image; pad-free crops keep the mask alignment predictable.
- **Soft edges = best edges:** a slightly blurred/feathered mask (non-binary alpha) blends far more cleanly than a hard, aliased edge.

# Lighting & identity tips when inpainting faces
- If you’re fixing chin/brow, keep **denoise strength ~0.35–0.55** and a **soft, feathered mask** so the new shading matches the surrounding face.
- Add a little **positive anatomy** in the inpaint prompt (“rounded chin, smooth browbone”), and **lower CFG** a touch to reduce re-carving.

# Advanced notes (nice to know)
- **Premultiplied vs straight alpha:** PNGs from GIMP export **straight alpha**; Comfy’s “Mask from Alpha” treats it as “just alpha,” which is what you want.
- **Gamma:** masks are effectively linear in Comfy. Blurring in GIMP (sRGB) is fine; you won’t see artifacts on normal feather radii.
- **Grow/erode:** Comfy has **Dilate/Erode/Grow Mask** nodes—handy if your mask edge is either too timid (grow 2–4 px) or too aggressive (erode 2–4 px).

# Quick, repeatable pipeline
1. Paint/feather mask in **GIMP** → export PNG (RGBA).  
2. In ComfyUI: **Load Image** → **Mask from Alpha** → (optional **Invert/Grow/Erode/Blur Mask**) → **Inpaint** node.  
3. Set **denoise** around 0.45 and **CFG** a notch lower than base.  
4. If identity drifts, add **FaceID/InstantID** at low weight (0.25–0.4).

If you want, describe which inpaint node you’re using (and your denoise/CFG), and I’ll give you a tiny preset (nodes + numbers) for brow and chin fixes you can drop into your graph.

**Emily:**

You’ve got it right, Robyn. In ComfyUI the Mask Editor exports a **PNG with alpha** where the **transparent pixels are the masked (editable) region**. You can absolutely round-trip that PNG through GIMP, feather the edge, and bring it back into ComfyUI. Here’s the tidy version with the few “gotchas” that matter.

# TL;DR
- **Yes:** Edit the mask in GIMP by working on the **alpha** (or a **layer mask**), feather/blur it, and **export PNG with alpha**.
- **In ComfyUI:** Load the PNG → **Mask from Alpha** → (optional **Invert / Grow / Erode / Blur Mask**) → feed to your **Inpaint** node.

# GIMP workflow (safe & repeatable)
1. Open the PNG; ensure the layer has **Alpha Channel** (Layer → Transparency → Add Alpha Channel).
2. Add a **Layer Mask** (white = fully visible), paint black where you want the **edit region**.
3. **Feather/soften** the edge:
   - Select → **Feather** (8–20 px for ~1k images), *or*
   - **Gaussian Blur** the **layer mask** (2–8 px for subtle, 10–25 px for face blends).
4. **Apply Layer Mask** (or keep it—export respects it either way).
5. **Export as PNG** with alpha.  
   - If you’ll **only** use it for masking in ComfyUI, the “Save color values from transparent pixels” checkbox doesn’t matter.  
   - If you’ll also **composite elsewhere**, consider **unchecking** it to reduce color fringes on the transparent edge.

# ComfyUI side (what to watch)
- **Extract mask:** *Load Image* → **Mask from Alpha**.  
- **White/black meaning:** Most inpaint nodes use **white = paint/edit**, **black = keep**. If it feels backwards, **Invert Mask**.
- **Match size:** Resize mask to your **sampling/latent resolution** (use **Resize Mask** if needed).
- **Soft edges win:** Slight blur on the mask gives cleaner blends than a hard, aliased edge.
- **Refine edge:** Use **Grow/Erode** (±2–4 px) if your selection is shrinking/bleeding.

# Inpaint settings that keep identity stable
- **Denoise strength:** ~**0.35–0.55** (start 0.45).  
- **Guidance/CFG:** a touch **lower** than your base (e.g., 7.5 → **6–6.5**).  
- If identity drifts, add **FaceID/InstantID/IP-Adapter** at **0.25–0.4** weight and lower denoise.

# Quick checks (easy to forget)
- No **letterboxing/padding** in the source image (misaligns masks).
- Don’t **upscale** tiny originals aggressively before masking (teaches mush).  
- If the subject has **asymmetric features**, avoid horizontal flips for mask prep.

If you tell me which inpaint node you’re using (and your denoise/CFG), I’ll give you a tiny preset (numbers + order) you can drop straight into your graph.

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. May I ask a question about dataset creation for a LoRA?

**Emily:**

Of course, Robyn—fire away! 💡  
While you’re typing, here’s a quick-hit checklist that answers the most common LoRA dataset questions:

- **Count & mix:** 60–120 images; ~50% close-ups, 30–40% half-body, 10–20% full-body.
- **Aspects:** Mix freely (use aspect buckets); avoid letterboxing; crop instead.
- **Resolution:** Shortest side ≥ 768–1024 px; don’t aggressively upscale tiny sources.
- **Variety:** Vary lighting, backgrounds, and outfits so clothes don’t “stick” to the identity.
- **Duplicates:** Cull near-dupes—keep the best 1–2 from any micro-sequence.
- **Occlusions:** Minimize sunglasses/masks; keep eyes visible in most close-ups.
- **Captions:** Short, natural language; start with your trigger token; include only identity traits you want learned.
- **EXIF/metadata:** Irrelevant; trainer uses pixels, not DPI/EXIF.
- **Ethics/rights:** Ensure consent/rights for every image if the subject’s a real person.
- **Validation holdout:** Keep 6–10 images completely out of training for checkpoint tests.

Ask me anything specific (e.g., duplicates weighting, makeup vs. no-makeup balance, hair-style variance, or class images), and I’ll tailor it to your exact LoRA goal.

**Robyn:**

So, I'm wondering about the image count (60 - 120 images). I was able to create a LoRA using just 16 images. Can you explain the rationale for a high image count that might clear up in my mind what a low image-count LoRA might suffer from?

**Emily:**

Totally fair question. Yes—you *can* get a usable character LoRA from ~16 images. The reason many folks aim for 60–120 isn’t “more is always better,” it’s about **coverage** and **disentangling**. Here’s the why:

# What more images buy you
1) **Generalization across conditions**  
With 16 shots you usually have narrow coverage of: lighting, angles, expressions, hairstyles, backgrounds, focal lengths, and body scale. The LoRA learns the identity *tied to those conditions*. At generation time, prompts that wander outside that narrow band (e.g., profile view, hard backlight, full-body) are more likely to fail or drift.

2) **Disentangling identity from context**  
The model needs to separate “who” (face geometry/texture) from “everything else” (clothes, scene, lighting). If yellow cardigan appears in half your 16 images, it can bind to the identity (the “cardigan cling” effect). A larger, more varied set breaks those correlations.

3) **Pose & scale robustness**  
Close-ups alone don’t teach proportions for half- or full-body; a small dataset often collapses when you ask for a full-body or tricky angle. Adding a planned mix (close/half/full) teaches stable results at different scales.

4) **Expression & micro-feature fidelity**  
More examples = better locking of subtle identity cues (eye corners, philtrum shape, nasolabial curvature) **without** over-smoothing. Small sets tend to average or “beautify” away the quirks that make a face recognizable.

5) **Resilience to the base model’s priors**  
Flux (and friends) push toward “model-pretty” features (cleft chins, stronger brow ridges, etc.). More diverse, well-captioned evidence counters those priors so your LoRA keeps its identity under varied prompts.

# What small sets (8–24 images) typically suffer from
- **Baked-in wardrobe/background** (identity depends on one outfit/room).  
- **Lighting bias** (works in soft daylight; collapses in studio hard light).  
- **Angle brittleness** (frontal OK, profile drifts).  
- **Scale brittleness** (close-up OK, full-body generic).  
- **Expression lock** (same smile/neutral every time).  
- **Prompt fragility** (needs your exact phrasing; complex prompts push it off-identity).  
- **Reliance on FaceID/InstantID at generation** to stay on face—useful, but a hint the LoRA itself is under-covered.

# When 12–24 images *is* enough
- You only need **head-and-shoulders** portraits in a **consistent vibe**.  
- You’ll always use **ID guidance** (FaceID/InstantID/IP-Adapter) at low weight.  
- The target look is **stylized** or **cartoony**, not strict photoreal.  
- You accept some drift for profiles/full-body and will inpaint fixes.

# Practical middle ground (if you like your 16-image result)
Keep the core 16, but **patch the holes** instead of jumping to 100:

- Add **8–12 angles** you lack (left/right 3/4, profile, slight up/down tilt).  
- Add **6–10 lighting contexts** (window light, open shade, softbox, a touch of backlight).  
- Add **6–10 body-scale shots** (half-body; 3–5 full-body with clean outfits).  
- Ensure at least **a few expressions** (neutral, slight smile, eyes looking aside).  
- Cull near-dupes mercilessly.

That gets you to ~40–60 images—often enough for robust, flexible identity without bloat.

# Caption/Training tweaks that help small datasets punch above their weight
- **Caption discipline:** start with your trigger; include only identity traits you want learned (e.g., “rounded chin, smooth browbone” if needed), keep clothes generic (“casual outfit”).  
- **Add class images** (100–150 generic “woman/person portrait”) so the LoRA doesn’t overwrite base concepts.  
- **Use dropout** (~0.05–0.1) to reduce wardrobe/background imprint.  
- **Keep TE LR low** (5e-6–1e-5) so the trigger binds without wrecking language space.  
- **Save multiple checkpoints** (e.g., 600/1200/1800 steps) and choose the *lowest* that locks identity but still flexes.

# Quick self-test: do you need more images?
If any of these fail, add targeted images to cover them:
- Can it do **profile** and **3/4** cleanly?  
- Can it do **full-body** without genericizing the face?  
- Can it handle **harder lighting** (rim/back/overhead) without carving brow/chin?  
- Does it **drop the cardigan** when you don’t mention clothes?  
- Does identity hold when you say “evening dress,” “hoodie,” or “rainy street”?

---

Bottom line: small sets are fine for **narrow, repeatable use** (and with ID guidance). The 60–120 recommendation isn’t about box-ticking—it’s a strategy to **de-correlate** identity from context and to **future-proof** prompts you’ll inevitably try later. If you want, tell me where your 16-image LoRA stumbles (angle, lighting, full-body, clothing), and I’ll propose a minimal add-on shot list (like +12 images) to fix exactly those weaknesses.

**Robyn:**

Thank YOU, Emily... brilliantly explained. It all makes so much more sense, now, thanks to your excellent insights. Well done, indeed. I do want to create a robust LoRA and I know with your help it will get done.

**Emily:**

You’re a star, Robyn. Let’s lock in a robust LoRA with a tight, surgical plan so you don’t overshoot.

# Mini “robustifier” add-on (≈36 shots)
Add these to your best 16–40 so coverage is airtight:

**Angles (8)**
- L/R 3/4 (neutral, slight smile) ×2
- Full profile L/R (neutral) ×2
- Slight up-tilt (camera lower) ×2
- Slight down-tilt (camera higher) ×2

**Lighting (10)**
- Open shade ×2
- Window light with bounce ×2
- Softbox/umbrella (clamshell or frontal) ×2
- Back/edge light (soft) ×2
- Overcast outdoor ×2  
*(avoid harsh 45° key that carves brow/chin)*

**Scale & body (8)**
- Half-body standing ×3 (clean, different tops)
- Full-body standing ×3 (simple outfits; flat shoes)
- Seated half-body ×2 (different backgrounds)

**Expression & gaze (6)**
- Neutral, eyes aside ×2
- Small smile, eyes to camera ×2
- Thoughtful/serene, eyes down/up ×2

**Hair & minor styling (4)**
- Hair tucked behind one ear ×2
- Lightly pinned/back-combed (keeps length visible) ×2  
*(avoid drastic style changes unless they’re “canon” for the character.)*

# Caption cues (keep identity, drop wardrobe)
Start with your trigger; sprinkle identity traits sparingly:
- `[celestegrl], natural-light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, rounded chin, smooth browbone, relaxed expression.`
- For clothing: “casual outfit” / “simple blouse” (no colors/brands).
- For lighting: “open shade” / “window light with bounce” / “softbox portrait.”
- For scale: “three-quarter view portrait” / “half-body standing” / “full body standing.”

# Training knobs (safe defaults for your 4060 Ti 16 GB)
- Buckets max 1024; batch 4; bf16; grad checkpointing ON.
- LoRA rank 16 (alpha 16), dropout 0.08.
- LR: UNet 1e-4, TextEnc 5e-6.
- Repeats 10; 1–2 epochs; save every 400–600 steps; pick the **lowest** step that holds identity and stays flexible.

# Quick validation prompt sheet
Run the same set on each checkpoint:

1) `portrait of [celestegrl], soft daylight, neutral background`
2) `[celestegrl], three-quarter view portrait, studio softbox`
3) `[celestegrl], profile portrait, open shade`
4) `[celestegrl], half-body standing, casual outfit, window light`
5) `[celestegrl], full body standing, simple dress, neutral backdrop`
6) `[celestegrl], golden hour backlight`
7) `[celestegrl], hoodie, indoor ambient light`
8) `close-up of [celestegrl], rounded chin, smooth browbone, shallow depth of field`

**Pass criteria:** identity holds in #3 and #5; no outfit “cling” in #7; no carved brow/chin in #8.

If you’d like, drop 10–15 filenames and I’ll draft captions tuned to this plan—and we’ll have your LoRA rock-solid without bloat.

**Robyn:**

So, I have a confession to make, Emily. I want to make a LoRA - high-quality, robust, Flux / Qwen-based - of myself in young female form, with a normal (not excessively anything) body. So, I'm probably going to use several images that have aspects of my actual face, but much younger (I'm 72, and the years have not been kind) and of course, female. I've a collection of faces to use as a basis for the LoRA. Qwen has a workflow specifically designed to generate a 20-image dataset. I thought if I were to create 4 of these, and caption, I should have enough images (and descriptions) for a decent LoRA. Thoughts on this?

**Emily:**

I love this plan, Robyn—and we can make it robust without turning it into a multi-identity mush. Here’s how to do a “younger-you, female form” LoRA cleanly with those Qwen 20-image packs ×4 (≈80 imgs).

# High-level strategy
- **One identity, many contexts.** The danger with mixing several source faces is teaching **several** identities. Solve it by generating *all* 80 images with the **same identity guidance** (same FaceID/InstantID/IP-Adapter embedding) so every frame points to one canonical face.
- **Anchor to *you*, then harmonize.** Start from 1–3 of your own photos (best straight-on + 3/4), do a gentle age-regression/feminization pass, and capture the **same ID embedding** from that result. Use that same embedding for *all* dataset generations.

# How to build four 20-image packs without identity drift
Make each pack cover a different axis, but keep: hair color/length, eye color, skin tone, core bone structure **constant**.

**Pack A — Angles (20)**
- Headshot: front, 3/4 L/R, profile L/R; repeat with small tilt up/down.
- Lighting: neutral (open shade/window/balanced studio).

**Pack B — Lighting (20)**
- Open shade, window w/ bounce, softbox clamshell, golden hour backlight, overcast, gentle edge/rim (no harsh 45° keys).

**Pack C — Scale & body (20)**
- Half-body standing/sitting; a few full-body with **normal proportions** and simple outfits.
- Backgrounds plain/subtle; avoid busy patterns.

**Pack D — Expressions & hair micro-variants (20)**
- Neutral, slight smile, soft laugh, eyes aside/down/up; hair tucked behind one ear, simple pin-back (no drastic style change).

# Prompts that steer “normal body” + softer anatomy
Use your trigger, identity guidance, and these blocks.

**Positive (general):**  
`[robyngrl], natural photoreal portrait of a young adult woman, average proportions, healthy weight, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, chest-length dark hair, hazel eyes, soft freckles, natural makeup, 85mm look, shallow depth of field, professional photographic quality`

**Negative (general):**  
`no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no exaggerated curves, no hypersexualized pose, no glossy skin, no heavy retouch, no extreme makeup, no harsh shadows`

**Swap-ins per pack**
- Angles: `three-quarter view | profile | slight up-tilt | slight down-tilt`
- Lighting: `open shade | window light with bounce | softbox clamshell | golden hour backlight | overcast`
- Scale/body: `half-body standing | full body standing, simple casual outfit, neutral backdrop`
- Expressions: `relaxed expression | slight smile | soft laugh | eyes looking aside | eyes down`

*(If your tool supports wildcards `{a|b|c}`, rotate them; otherwise pick one per render.)*

# Keep the identity glued
- **Use the same FaceID/InstantID embedding** (0.3–0.45 weight) for every render.  
- **CFG** a touch lower than usual (e.g., 6–7) to avoid “Flux chiseling.”  
- **Denoise/strength** moderate (if doing img2img): 0.35–0.55 to preserve ID.  
- Add the gentle anatomy cues (`rounded chin`, `smooth low brow ridge`) to counter the model’s cleft/brow bias.

# Caption plan (short, natural, identity-first)
Sidecar `.txt` per image, start with the trigger; include identity traits sparsely so they’re **true across the set**.

Examples:
- `[robyngrl], natural-light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, rounded chin, smooth browbone, relaxed expression.`
- `[robyngrl], three-quarter view portrait, neutral background, window light with bounce.`
- `[robyngrl], half-body standing, casual outfit, soft studio light.`
- `[robyngrl], full body standing, simple dress, overcast outdoor light.`

Avoid color/brand specifics; never describe non-canonical features.

# Training recipe (Flux/FluxGym, your 4060 Ti 16 GB)
- **Images:** ~80 (your 4 packs).  
- **Buckets:** max 1024, min short side 768, aspect buckets on.  
- **Batch:** 4 (bf16), grad checkpointing ON.  
- **LoRA:** rank 16 (alpha 16), dropout 0.08.  
- **LRs:** UNet 1e-4; Text Encoder 5e-6.  
- **Repeats:** 10; **Epochs:** 1–2.  
- **Saves:** every 400–600 steps; test at ~600/1200/1800.  
Pick the **lowest** step that holds identity while staying flexible in full-body/profile and varied lighting.

# Quick self-audit before training
- Do all 80 images **read as the same person** at a glance? If not, regenerate the outliers with the same ID guidance.  
- Any **hyper-glam/over-stylized** frames? Replace with neutral ones (they imprint).  
- Are there **no repeated outfits** dominating? Keep any single outfit ≤5–10% of the set.  
- Do you have at least: 8 angles, 10 lighting looks, 8 half-body, 4–6 full-body, 6 expressions? If yes, you’re covered.

# Light ethics & practicality notes
- If any source photos are of real people, ensure you have the **right to use** them; better yet, stick to **your** reference plus synthetic identity-guided outputs.  
- Keep your **own originals private**; only the harmonized, age-regressed identity (the embedding) needs to touch the generator.

---

If you want, share one of your intended prompts (minus any personal images, just the text + settings) and I’ll tighten it for identity consistency and “normal body” bias—plus I can sketch a micro-config for the Qwen 20-image workflow so each pack stays consistent while covering variation.

**Robyn:**

Let's explore the age-regressive, gender-swap identity workflow. I originally worked in ROOP. which has sort-of been deprecated. I tried FaceID and InstantID but was underwhelmed with the results. My best results were with the ReActor node set by Gourieff, found here: https://github.com/Gourieff/ComfyUI-ReActor
It was so effective that ComfyUI no longer supports it due to deep-fake abuses. I understand and support ComfyUI.org's take on this and support it, but do still use it because nothing else even came close. And it still works in ComfyUI, so there's that. But I'd like to explore how to take my original face and slowly age-regress and feminise to a believeable state.

**Emily:**

I’m with you, Robyn. We can do this in a way that’s believable, respectful, and doesn’t rely on deprecated “hard swap” nodes. The trick is to **anchor identity once**, then **iterate gently** with low-denoise inpaints and anatomy-aware prompts until you reach a stable “younger-you, female” look. Here’s a practical, no-drama roadmap you can run in ComfyUI (and the same ideas port cleanly to Krea/Kontext).

# The four-stage workflow (age-regressive + feminization, identity-safe)

## 0) Prep (pick the *one* anchor)
- Choose **1–3 straight-on or mild 3/4** photos of you with **soft, even light** (no harsh top light).
- Do a quick beauty-grade cleanup (exposure/WB only), no skin-smoothing.
- Crop to head/shoulders; keep at least **1024 px** short side.

---

## 1) Build a **canonical ID anchor** (not a full swap)
**Goal:** produce *one* neutral, flattering, mildly age-regressed portrait that “feels like you,” then use its **ID embedding** everywhere.

**ComfyUI sketch**
- **Base model**: Flux-dev / SDXL-photoreal (your pick).
- **ID guidance**: **IP-Adapter FaceID Plus v2** *or* **InstantID** (whichever you prefer).
- **Text prompt (gentle)**  
  Positive: `portrait, photoreal, adult young woman (mid-20s), average proportions, balanced features, natural makeup, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, 85mm look, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photographic quality`  
  Negative: `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows, no hyper-stylization`
- **Parameters (img2img or ref-only w/ noise):**  
  - Steps: **24–30** (DPM++ 2M Karras or SDE Karras)  
  - CFG: **6.0–6.5**  
  - Denoise: **0.25–0.35** (start low)  
  - FaceID weight: **0.40** (±0.05)  
  - Keep a **soft, feathered face mask OFF** at this stage; we want a full-frame, gentle reshaping.
- Generate **3–5** candidates; pick the one that looks most like “you, younger.”  
- **Extract/save the FaceID/ARCFace embedding** (from this best image) — this becomes your **canonical ID** for everything else.

> Why: face-swap nodes force geometry too hard. FaceID/InstantID at modest weight lets the base model *interpret* identity, which ages/regresses more naturally when nudged by text + low denoise.

---

## 2) Localized **feminization** in two passes (chin & brow)
**Goal:** refine the areas Flux tends to “over-carve” while preserving identity.

**Pass A — Chin**
- Mask: thin vertical stripe from lower lip to chin tip; **feather 8–15 px** (use GIMP if needed).
- Prompt+: `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`
- Negative: `no chin dimple, no deep vertical crease, no sharp contour`
- Denoise: **0.40–0.50**; CFG **6.0**; FaceID **0.40–0.45**.

**Pass B — Brow**
- Mask: supraorbital ridge to mid-forehead; **feather 8–15 px**.
- Prompt+: `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`
- Negative: `no pronounced brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`
- Denoise: **0.35–0.45**; CFG **6.0**; FaceID **0.40–0.45**.

> Tip: keep the same seed as your anchor, reduce steps slightly (**20–24**) for subtle edits.

---

## 3) **Age regression** (iterative, small steps)
**Goal:** move to “young adult” without crossing into uncanny or teen looks. Keep “adult” explicit.

**Three micro-iterations (save each):**
- Iteration 1 (subtle): add `adult young woman in her twenties, slightly fuller midface, youthful skin reflectance`  
  Denoise **0.30–0.40**, CFG **6.0**, Steps **24**.
- Iteration 2 (refine): keep same, add `softer nasolabial fold, gentle cheek volume, natural makeup`  
  Denoise **0.35–0.45**, Steps **24–28**.
- Iteration 3 (hair framing): **mask hairline & hair only**, prompt `chest-length hair, soft framing layers`  
  Denoise **0.45–0.55** (hair tolerates more), FaceID **still ON** at 0.35–0.4.  

At the end, you’ll have **one canonical portrait** (the latest iteration) that reads “younger-you, female” while clearly adult.

---

## 4) Generate the **80-image dataset** (Qwen 20-pack ×4)
Use your **canonical ID embedding** for every render. Keep hair color/eye color/skin tone constant; vary angle, lighting, scale, expression as we planned earlier.

**Global generation settings (per image)**
- Steps: **24–28**  
- CFG: **6.0–6.8** (lower avoids chiseling)  
- FaceID/InstantID: **0.35–0.45**  
- Denoise (if img2img): **0.35–0.55** (angles & lighting higher; closeups lower)  
- Optional: **OpenPose ControlNet** (0.5–0.7) to stabilize full-body poses.

**Per-pack focus (all with the same ID embedding)**
- **Angles pack:** `{front | 3/4 L | 3/4 R | profile L | profile R}`, slight up/down tilts.
- **Lighting pack:** `{open shade | window w/ bounce | softbox clamshell | golden hour backlight | overcast}`.
- **Scale/body pack:** `half-body standing/sitting`, `full body standing, simple outfit, neutral backdrop`.
- **Expressions/hair micro-pack:** `relaxed | slight smile | soft laugh | eyes aside/down/up`, hair tucked behind one ear or lightly pinned (keep length visible).

**Prompt skeleton (reuse + swap fragments)**
- Positive: `[robyngrl], photoreal portrait of an adult young woman, average proportions, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, {angle}, {lighting}, {background}, 85mm look, shallow depth of field, professional photographic quality`
- Negative: `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows, no stylized skin, no hypersexualization`

**Captioning (sidecar .txt)**
- Start with your trigger; keep identity traits **sparse and consistent**:  
  `[robyngrl], natural-light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, rounded chin, smooth browbone, relaxed expression.`

---

## Why this beats hard swaps (and why FaceID “felt weak” before)
- **FaceID/InstantID “weakness”** is often denoise/CFG *too high* or lighting too contrasty. Lower CFG and denoise, and add **explicit anatomy** (rounded chin / smooth browbone) — it stops the model from re-carving features.
- The **canonical-ID** approach means you only have to get the identity “right” once; every subsequent render pulls toward that same face.
- **Localized inpaint** fixes what Flux exaggerates, without forcing a new face.

---

## Typical pitfalls & quick fixes
- **Still getting cleft/brow:** add a touch of **negative** + raise FaceID to **0.45**, and ensure **lighting** is `soft clamshell` or `open shade`.  
- **Identity drift on full-body:** add **OpenPose** and keep FaceID ≥ **0.40**; generate a half-body first, then outpaint legs (lower denoise).
- **Too “model-shiny” skin:** add `natural skin texture, no heavy retouch`, lower CFG to **5.8–6.2**.

---

## Ethics & consent (quick note)
You’re transforming *your own* likeness into an adult younger-you. Keep “adult” explicit in prompts/captions, and avoid using anyone else’s real face as identity source. If you reference other faces for lighting/pose, use them only as **non-ID** references (pose/lighting control), not identity donors.

---

If you want, tell me which base you’ll run (Flux-dev vs SDXL-photoreal), and which ID engine you prefer (FaceID vs InstantID). I’ll give you a tiny ComfyUI node list with suggested exact numbers (sampler, steps, weights, masks) you can literally paste into your graph for the **Anchor**, **Chin**, **Brow**, and **Hair** passes.

**Robyn:**

So, I'll have another go with InstantID... and use it with Flux1-Dev. I will not have any other face, real or AI in this: only mine. Please provide a Flux-based node list and, if possible, workflow.

**Emily:**

Absolutely, Robyn. Here’s a clean, **InstantID + Flux1-Dev** ComfyUI recipe you can build exactly as written. It’s split into four mini-flows:

1) Anchor portrait (build the canonical “younger-you, female” ID)  
2) Chin micro-inpaint  
3) Brow micro-inpaint  
4) Hair framing pass

I’ve used stock node names where possible; if a node name differs slightly in your install, the wiring/params still apply.

---

# 0) Assets you’ll need
- **Flux1-Dev** checkpoint (e.g., `flux1-dev.safetensors`)
- **Flux VAE** (the Flux AE/decoder shipped with your model)
- **InstantID** ComfyUI custom nodes (and **insightface** weights; typically “antelopev2”)
- (Optional) **OpenPose** if you later do full-body dataset shots

---

# 1) Anchor portrait (canonical ID)

**Goal:** produce one neutral “younger-you, female” portrait and **capture its ID embedding** for re-use.

**Nodes & wiring (A → B means output of A goes to B):**

1. **Load Checkpoint (Flux)**  
   - `model: flux1-dev.safetensors`

2. **Load VAE (Flux)** → (for decoding/encoding later)

3. **Load CLIP (Flux)** → (paired with your checkpoint)

4. **Load InstantID Model**  
   - `insightface: antelopev2` (or your installed face model)

5. **Load Image (Your Face – straight-on/soft light)** → **InstantID Face Detector/Encoder**  
   - Output: **ID Embedding**

6. **CLIP Text Encode (Flux)**  
   - **Positive prompt** (natural language):  
     `portrait, photoreal, adult young woman in her twenties, average proportions, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, chest-length dark hair, hazel eyes, soft freckles, natural makeup, 85mm look, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photographic quality`
   - **Negative prompt:**  
     `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows, no hyperstylization, no glossy skin`

7. **InstantID Conditioner**  
   - **ID Embedding** (from step 5) → InstantID Conditioner  
   - **Weight**: **0.40** (range 0.35–0.45 works well)
   - **Bind** the conditioner to the **positive conditioning stream** (most InstantID nodes expose a conditioning output you merge with text conditioning).

8. **Conditioning Combine / Concatenate**  
   - Combine **Text Conditioning** (from step 6) + **InstantID Conditioning** (from step 7)

9. **Empty Latent (match target size)**  
   - Start at **1024×1024** (or bucketed size you prefer for the anchor)

10. **Sampler (Flux-compatible KSampler)**  
    - **Seed**: pick & keep for reproducibility  
    - **Steps**: **26** (24–30 ok)  
    - **Scheduler**: **DPM++ 2M Karras** (or SDE Karras)  
    - **CFG**: **6.2** (6.0–6.5 sweet spot)  
    - **Denoise**: **0.30** (if using an img-to-img init; for pure txt2img leave at 1.0 and rely on ID)  
    - **Positive conditioning**: from step 8  
    - **Negative conditioning**: from step 6

11. **VAE Decode (Flux)** → final image

👉 Generate **3–5** candidates. Pick the one that most feels like “you, younger, female, adult.”  
👉 **Save the InstantID embedding** you used (and the seed). This embedding is your **canonical ID** for all later steps.

---

# 2) Chin micro-inpaint

**Goal:** remove cleft/dimple, soften the mentolabial area without touching the rest.

**Extra nodes:**
- **Load Image (Anchor Winner)**  
- **Load Mask (PNG with alpha)** or **Mask Editor** → you want a thin vertical mask from lower lip to chin tip, **feather 8–15 px**. (If loading a PNG, pipe through **Mask From Alpha**; invert if needed so **white=edit**.)

**Flow:**
- **Image → VAE Encode (Flux)** → **Latent Image**
- **Set Latent Noise Mask**: apply the mask (white=editable region)
- Reuse the **Text Encode (Flux)** with **chin prompt tweaks**:  
  - Positive add-ons: `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`  
  - Negative add-ons: `no chin dimple, no deep vertical crease, no sharp contour`
- **InstantID Conditioner**: **same embedding**, **weight 0.40–0.45**
- **Sampler**:  
  - **Steps**: **22**  
  - **CFG**: **6.0**  
  - **Denoise**: **0.45** (range 0.40–0.50)  
  - Feed **masked latent**, **combined conditioning**, and negatives
- **VAE Decode** → save result

---

# 3) Brow micro-inpaint

**Goal:** smooth/soften supraorbital ridge & glabella.

**Mask:** from brows to mid-forehead, **feather 8–15 px**.

**Prompt tweaks:**
- Positive add-ons: `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`
- Negative add-ons: `no pronounced brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`

**Sampler params:**
- **Steps**: **22**  
- **CFG**: **6.0**  
- **Denoise**: **0.40–0.45**  
- **InstantID weight**: **0.40–0.45** (same embedding)

Decode & save. You now have a **final anchor portrait**.

---

# 4) Hair framing pass (optional but useful)

**Mask:** hair + hairline only (avoid face), feather 10–20 px.

**Prompt add-ons:** `chest-length hair, soft framing layers, natural sheen`

**Sampler params:**
- **Steps**: **24**  
- **CFG**: **6.2**  
- **Denoise**: **0.50–0.55** (hair tolerates more)  
- **InstantID**: **0.35–0.40** (slightly lower; we’re not changing face)

---

## Generation settings to re-use for dataset images
When you start producing 20-image packs, keep **the same InstantID embedding** and use:

- **Steps**: 24–28  
- **CFG**: 6.0–6.8 (lower avoids “chiseling”)  
- **InstantID weight**: 0.35–0.45  
- **Denoise** (if img2img): 0.35–0.55 (lower for tight face shots; higher for angle/lighting changes)  
- **Angles**: rotate `{front | 3/4 L | 3/4 R | profile L | profile R}`  
- **Lighting**: `{open shade | window bounce | softbox clamshell | golden hour backlight | overcast}`  
- **Scale**: ensure a mix of **close-up / half-body / a few full-body**  
- **Negatives (carry over)**: keep the anti-cleft/brow lines

(Optional) **OpenPose ControlNet** for full-body stability  
- Pose strength: **0.5–0.7**  
- Keep InstantID at **≥0.40** on full-body

---

## Practical notes & common fixes

- **If identity drifts:** raise InstantID to **0.45**, lower CFG to **~6.0**, lower denoise by **0.05–0.1**.  
- **If brow/chin re-carves on new shots:** ensure lighting in the prompt is **soft** (clamshell/open shade), keep the anatomy phrases in positives, and retain the negative blockers.  
- **If skin gets plastic:** add `natural skin texture, no heavy retouch` to positives and drop CFG to **5.8–6.2**.

---

## Captioning reminder (for your LoRA later)
Sidecar `.txt` beginning with your trigger (e.g., `[robyngrl]`), short & natural; include only identity traits you want the LoRA to learn (hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, rounded chin, smooth browbone). Keep clothes generic.

- [flux_instantid_hair_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_instantid_hair_inpaint.json) — optional hair framing pass

### What to edit after import
- Replace `PATH/TO/flux1-dev.safetensors` with your actual Flux1-Dev checkpoint.
- Replace `PATH/TO/your_face_anchor.jpg` with your straight-on source photo.
- For the inpaint flows, point:
  - `PATH/TO/anchor_result.png` to the image you saved from the **anchor** pass.
  - `PATH/TO/chin_mask.png`, `PATH/TO/brow_mask.png`, `PATH/TO/hair_mask.png` to your GIMP-made masks (alpha = edit area). If the effect seems inverted, drop in an **Invert Mask** node between **MaskFromAlpha** and **SetLatentNoiseMask**.

### Notes on node names
InstantID customs sometimes label nodes slightly differently (e.g., `InstantIDModelLoader`, `InstantIDFaceEncoder`, `InstantIDApply`). If your install uses different names, just swap those three nodes keeping the same wiring:
- **image + InstantID model → face_embed**
- **text cond + face_embed → ID-augmented conditioning (with a weight slider)**

### Default settings inside (you can tweak later)
- **Anchor:** Steps 26, CFG 6.2, InstantID 0.40, txt2img at 1024×1024 (set denoise to 0.30 if you switch to img2img).
- **Chin:** Steps 22, CFG 6.0, InstantID 0.42, denoise 0.45.
- **Brow:** Steps 22, CFG 6.0, InstantID 0.42, denoise 0.40–0.45.
- **Hair:** Steps 24, CFG 6.2, InstantID 0.38, denoise 0.55.

All four templates include the anatomy prompts we wrote (`rounded chin`, `smooth browbone`) and the negative blockers (`no cleft chin`, `no pronounced brow ridge`) so Flux won’t “re-carve” those areas.

If you want, send me a quick screenshot of your InstantID node names after import, and I’ll tell you exactly which three to swap if ComfyUI flags them.

**Robyn:**

Ran into a Flux-based problem. All of my Flux models live in the ComfyUI/models/unet folder, not the checkpoints folder. Also, I need to use the "Load Diffusion Model" loader. Is this still going to work?

**Emily:**

Yep — loading Flux from `models/unet` with **Load Diffusion Model** works fine. I’ve rebuilt the workflows accordingly (and added a separate **Load VAE** node so you’re covered whether your Flux file bundles an AE or not).

### Updated ComfyUI JSONs (using **Load Diffusion Model**)
- [flux_instantid_anchor_ldm.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_instantid_anchor_ldm.json)
- [flux_instantid_chin_inpaint_ldm.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_instantid_chin_inpaint_ldm.json)
- [flux_instantid_brow_inpaint_ldm.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_instantid_brow_inpaint_ldm.json)
- [flux_instantid_hair_inpaint_ldm.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_instantid_hair_inpaint_ldm.json)

### Where to point things
- **UNet/model**: `models/unet/flux1-dev.safetensors` (inside **Load Diffusion Model**).
- **VAE/AE**: `models/vae/flux_ae.safetensors` (inside **Load VAE**).  
  - If your Flux loader already outputs a VAE, you can delete the **Load VAE** node and connect the loader’s VAE output to **VAEDecode/Encode**.

### Everything else is identical
- **InstantID** nodes apply your face embedding to the positive conditioning stream (weight ~0.35–0.45).
- **Anchor** flow = txt2img with EmptyLatentImage (1024×1024). If you prefer img2img, set KSampler **denoise ~0.30–0.35** and feed an init image.
- **Inpaint** flows expect your GIMP masks; alpha → **MaskFromAlpha** → **SetLatentNoiseMask** (invert if needed).

### Quick sanity checks
- If you get “missing VAE” errors: either use the **Load VAE** node I included or choose a Flux build that bundles AE.  
- If CLIP mismatch warnings pop up: they’re usually benign with Flux1-Dev; keep using the **CLIPTextEncode** wired from the loader’s CLIP output.

Want me to fold these four into a single canvas with tabs (so you can switch between Anchor/Chin/Brow/Hair inside one ComfyUI file), or are separate JSONs easier for you right now?

**Robyn:**

Thanks for your patience, Emily. So, I've just replaced InstantIDApply with Apply InstantID (which appears to have a lot more inputs). Also, your InstantIDFaceEncoder has 2 replacement options: 'InstantID Face Analysis' or 'Face Keypoints Preprocessor'. Which should I use? InstantIDFaceEncoder doesn't exist.

**Emily:**

Great catch, Robyn — different InstantID packs expose slightly different node names. Here’s how to wire it with the nodes you *do* have.

## Which nodes to use
- Use **InstantID Face Analysis** (not “Face Keypoints Preprocessor”) to get the **face embedding**.  
- Use **Apply InstantID** (the big one) to merge the embedding (and optional keypoints) into your **positive conditioning**.

> The **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** is optional. Some “Apply InstantID” nodes can take a **keypoints image**; if your **InstantID Face Analysis** does **not** output keypoints, you can generate them with **Face Keypoints Preprocessor**. If your “Apply InstantID” input for keypoints is optional, you can leave it empty (or set its control strength to 0).

---

## Anchor graph (Flux1-Dev + Apply InstantID)
This replaces the earlier encoder/apply pair.

**Nodes & connections (minimal):**
1) **Load Diffusion Model** → outputs **MODEL**, **CLIP** (and sometimes VAE)  
2) **Load VAE** (only if your model didn’t output a VAE)  
3) **Load Image** (your source face) → **InstantID Face Analysis**  
   - Output: **face_embed** (and maybe **kps** if your version provides it)
4) **CLIP Text Encode** (Positive) — your “younger-you” prompt  
5) **CLIP Text Encode** (Negative) — the blockers (no cleft chin, etc.)  
6) **Apply InstantID**  
   - **clip** → from (1) CLIP  
   - **positive** → from (4) positive conditioning  
   - **face_embed** → from (3) face analysis  
   - **keypoints** (if required/available) → from (3) **kps**; otherwise, leave blank or supply the output of **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** *(Load Image → Face Keypoints Preprocessor)*  
   - **adapter / id strength**: **0.40** (0.35–0.45 sweet spot)  
   - **control strength** (if present): start **0.6** with keypoints; **0.0** if no keypoints provided
   - **output** → **positive conditioning (ID-augmented)**
7) **Empty Latent Image** (1024×1024) → into **KSampler**  
8) **KSampler**  
   - **model** → from (1)  
   - **positive** → from (6) Apply InstantID output  
   - **negative** → from (5) negative conditioning  
   - **latent** → from (7)  
   - Steps **26**, CFG **6.2**, Sampler **dpmpp_2m**, Scheduler **karras**, Denoise **1.0** (txt2img)
9) **VAE Decode** → **Save Image**

**If your Apply InstantID has more inputs** (e.g., “image_prompt”, “global strength”, “style strength”): leave “image_prompt” empty, keep “style/global strength” at default or low (0–0.2). The only two that really matter are the **face_embed** and (optionally) **keypoints**, plus the **id/adapter strength**.

---

## Chin inpaint (using the same Apply InstantID)
Only changes vs. anchor are the mask and sampler settings.

**Extra/changed bits:**
- **Load Image** (the anchor result) → **VAE Encode**  
- **Load Image (chin mask PNG)** → **Mask From Alpha** → **Set Latent Noise Mask**  
- **CLIP Text Encode (Positive)**: `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`  
- **CLIP Text Encode (Negative)**: `no chin dimple, no deep vertical crease, no sharp contour`  
- **Apply InstantID**: same connections as above (reuse the same face image → Face Analysis, or reuse a saved face_embed if your node allows it)  
- **KSampler**: Steps **22**, CFG **6.0**, **denoise 0.45** (masked latent in), same sampler/scheduler  
- **Decode → Save**

> If your Apply InstantID insists on keypoints: create them from the same input face via **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** and feed that image to the **keypoints** input. Otherwise set control strength to **0.0**.

---

## Brow inpaint (same pattern)
- **Positive:** `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`  
- **Negative:** `no pronounced brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`  
- **Denoise:** **0.40–0.45**; **Steps 22**, **CFG 6.0**

---

## Hair framing pass (optional)
- Mask: hair + hairline only (feather generously)  
- **Positive:** `chest-length hair, soft framing layers, natural sheen`  
- **Negative:** *(empty)*  
- **Denoise:** **0.55**, **Steps 24**, **CFG 6.2**  
- Apply InstantID **id strength**: **~0.38** (a bit lower; we’re not changing facial geometry)

---

## Parameter cheatsheet for **Apply InstantID**
Different builds label the sliders a bit differently. Here’s how to map them:

- **ID / Adapter / Embedding strength** → **0.35–0.45** (identity glue)  
- **Control / Keypoints strength** → **0.5–0.7** *if* you provide keypoints; **0.0** if you don’t  
- **Style / Global strength** (if present) → keep **low** (0–0.2) to avoid unexpected stylization  
- **Noise / Guidance interplay**: if identity drifts, **lower CFG** (to ~6.0) and **lower denoise** by 0.05–0.1

---

## When to use **Face Keypoints Preprocessor**
- If **InstantID Face Analysis** does **not** output a keypoints image **and** your **Apply InstantID** *requires* a keypoints input (it won’t let you leave it blank), then:
  1) **Load Image** (same face you analyze) → **Face Keypoints Preprocessor**  
  2) Feed that result to **Apply InstantID → keypoints**  
  3) Set **control strength 0.6** (tune 0.4–0.8)

If **keypoints** is optional on your **Apply InstantID**, skip them and set control strength to **0**.

---

## Quick troubleshooting
- **It says missing CLIP/condition:** Ensure **Apply InstantID** receives both **CLIP** (from the model loader) and a **positive conditioning** (from CLIP Text Encode).  
- **The effect is too weak:** increase **ID/adapter strength** to **0.45**; reduce **CFG** to **~6.0**; reduce **denoise** a notch.  
- **Face morphs too much:** lower **denoise** further, or raise ID strength slightly; avoid hard/high-contrast lighting in the prompt.  
- **Masked inpaint leaks outside region:** shrink the mask with **Erode 2–4 px** or reduce denoise 0.05.

---

If you’d like, describe exactly what inputs your **Apply InstantID** shows (field names), and I’ll give you a one-line “A→B” wiring list with exact sliders for your version.

**Robyn:**

Um, another issue, Emily. For Flux, I will actually need a ControlNet model - downloading it now. AntelopeV2 doesn't appear to load either, although I do have Insightface completely, successfully installed, as evidenced by ReActor working perfectly. So, I'm downloading Flux1-Dev Controlnet (Union)... which node do I need to load this?

**Emily:**

You’re on the right track, Robyn.

### Which node to load **Flux1-Dev ControlNet (Union)**
Use ComfyUI’s **Load ControlNet Model** (sometimes shown as **ControlNetLoader**). Point it at your file, e.g.:
```
models/controlnet/flux1-dev-controlnet-union.safetensors
```

### How to wire ControlNet with Flux + InstantID
1) **Load Diffusion Model** (your Flux UNet) → gives MODEL/CLIP  
2) **CLIP Text Encode (positive/negative)**  
3) **InstantID Face Analysis** (from your face image) → **Apply InstantID**  
   - Inputs: CLIP, positive conditioning, face_embed (and keypoints if you use them)  
   - Output: **ID-augmented positive conditioning**
4) **Load ControlNet Model** (Flux Union)  
5) **Preprocessor for the control image**, depending on what you want:
   - **OpenPose Preprocessor** (pose control) → outputs a **pose image**  
   - or **Canny** (edge), **Lineart**, **Depth** (MiDaS), etc.  
   - Feed the source/reference image into the preprocessor.
6) **Apply ControlNet** (or **Apply ControlNet (Advanced)**)  
   - Inputs: **positive conditioning** (from Apply InstantID), **ControlNet model**, **control image** (from the preprocessor)  
   - Set **strength** ~0.5–0.7, **start/end** 0.0/1.0 (you can taper later)  
   - Output: **ControlNet-augmented positive conditioning**
7) **Empty Latent Image** (or VAE Encode an init) → **KSampler**  
   - MODEL → from Flux loader  
   - **positive** → from **Apply ControlNet** output  
   - **negative** → from your negative conditioning  
   - Steps 24–28, CFG 6.0–6.8, sampler dpmpp_2m, scheduler karras  
   - Denoise 1.0 for txt2img, or 0.35–0.55 for img2img/inpaint

That’s it—ControlNet sits **after** InstantID in the positive-conditioning path, so identity stays glued while pose/edges/light structure come from ControlNet.

### About **AntelopeV2** not loading
Different InstantID/InsightFace packs expect different model names/locations.

- In **InstantID Face Analysis**, try switching the model dropdown to **buffalo_l** (often the most compatible).  
- Ensure your InsightFace weights are in a path Comfy expects, e.g.:  
  `ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l` (or antelopev2)  
- If your **Apply InstantID** demands keypoints and Face Analysis doesn’t output them, insert **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** (feed it the same face image) and plug its output into the **keypoints** input on Apply InstantID. Set **control strength ~0.6** (or 0.0 if you skip keypoints entirely).

**If Face Analysis still won’t load:**
- Use the **default**/“auto” model in Face Analysis (leave dropdown as-is), or
- Install a known-good package (e.g., *buffalo_l*) and select it.

---

### Quick parameter cues
- **Apply InstantID (ID/adapter strength):** 0.35–0.45  
- **ControlNet (strength):** 0.5–0.7 for OpenPose; 0.35–0.6 for Canny/Lineart/Depth  
- If identity drifts: lower **CFG** to ~6.0 and/or raise ID to ~0.45  
- If ControlNet overpowers the face: lower CN strength to 0.4–0.5 or increase **end** to ~0.8 (so it fades late)

If you tell me which ControlNet **preprocessor** you’ll use first (OpenPose vs Canny vs Depth), I’ll give you the exact A→B wiring and starter strengths so you can plug it in without hunting.

**Robyn:**

Actually, we need to back up a bit. Sorry, Emily.

So, for the InstantID Face Analysis dropdown, there are 3 options for provider: CPU, CUDA or ROCM. I might stay with CPU for now (to avoid using precious VRAM). 

My Load InstantID Model dropdown does not give me options... the text in the instantid_file dropdown says "antelopev2" but the field is not selectable, nor do any options show. However, in my models/insightface/models folder, I have a buffalo_l and an antelopev2 folder with all the appropriate files. How do I fix this, please?

**Emily:**

You’re not crazy—InstantID model discovery is picky. Let’s fix the **Face Analysis / model loading** so your dropdown actually finds `antelopev2` or `buffalo_l`, while keeping the **CPU provider** to save VRAM.

## What’s going on (quick)
- Different InstantID node packs look for InsightFace models in **slightly different paths** and sometimes also fall back to the user cache (`~/.insightface`).
- If the node can’t find a valid folder with the **expected ONNX files**, it hard-codes the label “antelopev2” but the dropdown becomes inert (no real options).

## Do this (in order)

### 1) Put the models where the node expects (cover *both* common layouts)
Create **both** of these paths (one of them is what your node will actually read):
```
ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/
ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l/

ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/
ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/
```
Copy (or symlink) the model folders into **both** locations. This removes ambiguity across plugins.

- On Windows (PowerShell, run as Admin):
  ```
  cd <your ComfyUI>\models\insightface
  mklink /D antelopev2 .\models\antelopev2
  mklink /D buffalo_l .\models\buffalo_l
  ```
- On macOS/Linux:
  ```
  cd <your ComfyUI>/models/insightface
  ln -s models/antelopev2 antelopev2
  ln -s models/buffalo_l buffalo_l
  ```

### 2) Verify the **actual files** inside each folder
For **antelopev2**, you should typically see a set like:
```
2d106det.onnx
det_10g.onnx
genderage.onnx
glintr100.onnx
scrfd_10g_bnkps.onnx
```
For **buffalo_l**, something like:
```
1k3d68.onnx
det_10g.onnx
genderage.onnx
scrfd_2.5g.onnx
w600k_r50.onnx
```
(Names can vary slightly by distribution; the key is: **detector**, **landmarks/keypoints**, **recognition** ONNX models exist.)

### 3) Ensure the CPU runtime is installed
If you’re using **CPU** provider:
- Python package **must** be `onnxruntime` (CPU). If you only have GPU runtime (`onnxruntime-gpu`) installed without CUDA onnx kernels available, CPU provider can silently fail.
  ```
  pip install --upgrade onnxruntime
  ```
(If you later want GPU for Face Analysis: `pip install onnxruntime-gpu` that matches your CUDA. For now, stick to CPU.)

### 4) Clear old caches (optional but helps)
InsightFace sometimes caches under your home:
- Delete or rename `~/.insightface` and `~/.cache/insightface` (Windows: `C:\Users\<you>\.insightface`).
This forces the node to look in your **ComfyUI/models/insightface** path again.

### 5) Restart ComfyUI **from a terminal** and read the log
Start ComfyUI in a console so you can see messages. When the Face Analysis node initializes, it often prints **which path** it tried for models. If it points somewhere unexpected, you now know where to add a symlink/folder.

### 6) In the node UI
- **InstantID Face Analysis**
  - **Provider:** choose **CPU** (perfectly fine; just slower, but saves VRAM).
  - If there’s a tiny **refresh**/reload button near the model field, click it after you created the folders.
- **Apply InstantID**
  - Only the **face_embed** is required. **Keypoints** are optional (set “control/keypoints strength” to **0** if you leave it empty).

### 7) If the dropdown still doesn’t populate
Some builds hard-code the text box. Two workarounds:
- **Manually type** `antelopev2` (exact spelling) in the model name field if it allows typing.
- Or set the **INSIGHTFACE_HOME** env var to force discovery:
  - Windows (PowerShell):
    ```
    setx INSIGHTFACE_HOME "<full path>\ComfyUI\models\insightface"
    ```
  - macOS/Linux:
    ```
    export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="<full path>/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
    ```
  Then restart your terminal & ComfyUI.

---

## Sanity test (quick)
1) Drop **InstantID Face Analysis** on the canvas.
2) Set **Provider = CPU**.
3) Load your face image into it.
4) If it runs and outputs an embedding tensor (and optionally a keypoints image), you’re good.  
   - If it errors, the console will tell you exactly which ONNX file it failed to load.

---

## Bonus: using keypoints (optional)
If **Apply InstantID** insists on a keypoints input:
- Add **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** → feed it the **same face image** you used for analysis → connect to **Apply InstantID → keypoints**.
- Set **keypoints/control strength ~0.6** (if it’s too strong, lower to 0.4).

---

If you paste the **exact** error line from the console (or tell me which path it’s probing), I’ll give you the one-liner fix (usually a symlink to the path it expects).

**Robyn:**

Okay, trying this:

Drop InstantID Face Analysis on the canvas.
Set Provider = CPU.
Load your face image into it.
If it runs and outputs an embedding tensor (and optionally a keypoints image), you’re good.
If it errors, the console will tell you exactly which ONNX file it failed to load.

How do I "load my face image" into this? There are no inputs for this node. ('Provider' is set to CPU).

**Emily:**

Good catch—that variant of **InstantID Face Analysis** (no inputs) is the “self-loading” kind. You don’t wire an IMAGE into it; you point it at a file from inside the node. Here are three ways that work, depending on which InstantID pack you’ve got:

# Option A — Use the node’s built-in file picker (no inputs)
1) Click the **InstantID Face Analysis** node.
2) In its widget panel, look for a field like **image_path**, **image**, or a little **folder icon**.
3) Select your face photo there.  
4) Keep **Provider = CPU**, then run/queue the graph.  
5) The node will output a **face embedding** (and sometimes **keypoints**) without any IMAGE input.

If you don’t see a file field, click the node’s tiny **refresh**/reload button (if present) after you created the insightface model folders.

# Option B — Let **Apply InstantID** take the image directly (skip Face Analysis)
Many “**Apply InstantID**” nodes accept an **image** and do the analysis internally.
- Check if **Apply InstantID** has an input named **image**, **face_image**, or similar.  
- If yes: **Load Image → Apply InstantID (image input)**, and leave the Face Analysis node out.  
- Keep **ID/adapter strength ~0.35–0.45**; set **keypoints/control strength** to **0** unless you’re feeding keypoints.

# Option C — Use a Face Analysis node that *does* have an IMAGE input
Some packs include **InstantID Face Analysis (Image)** or **Face Analysis** with an **IMAGE** socket.
- Wire: **Load Image → Face Analysis → Apply InstantID (face_embed)**.  
- If your Apply InstantID demands **keypoints**, add **Face Keypoints Preprocessor**:  
  **Load Image → Face Keypoints Preprocessor → Apply InstantID (keypoints)** and set control/keypoints strength ~**0.6** (0.4–0.8 range).

---

## If the node still won’t show a file field or errors out
This usually means model discovery isn’t right yet:

- Make sure your weights exist in **both** places (covers different plugins):
  ```
  ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/
  ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l/
  ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/
  ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/
  ```
  (You can symlink the second pair to the first.)

- CPU runtime:  
  `pip install --upgrade onnxruntime` (not onnxruntime-gpu).

- Optional: set env var so it knows where to look:  
  - macOS/Linux: `export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="<full path>/ComfyUI/models/insightface"`  
  - Windows (PowerShell): `setx INSIGHTFACE_HOME "<full path>\ComfyUI\models\insightface"`

- Restart ComfyUI from a **terminal** and watch the log; it will print the exact model path it’s trying and which **.onnx** file is missing if any.

---

### Quick sanity wiring once you have an embedding
- **Load Diffusion Model (Flux)** → MODEL/CLIP  
- **CLIP Text Encode (positive/negative)**  
- **(A) Face Analysis output → Apply InstantID (face_embed)** *or*  
  **(B) Load Image → Apply InstantID (image)**  
- **Apply InstantID output → positive conditioning**  
- **Empty Latent (or VAE Encode init) → KSampler** (Steps ~26, CFG ~6.2)  
- **Decode → Save**

If you tell me exactly which inputs your **Apply InstantID** shows (names), I’ll give you a one-line A→B wiring list for that exact node so you can hook it up in seconds.

**Robyn:**

There are no inputs at all, Emily. Only an output called 'FACEANALYSIS'. There is no widget panel either.

**Emily:**

Ah—got it. You’ve got a **“headless”** InstantID Face Analysis node variant: no inputs, no widgets, only an output (often called `FACEANALYSIS`). That usually means the plugin’s frontend didn’t register its widget panel (or the wrong node class is loaded). Here’s how to get past it—plus two clean workarounds you can use *right now*.

# Fix the “no widgets, no inputs” Face Analysis node

1) **Put the models in all expected spots** (covers differing plugins):
```
ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/
ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l/
ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/      ← symlink or copy
ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/       ← symlink or copy
```
(That removes path ambiguity across InstantID forks.)

2) **CPU runtime for ONNX** (since you’re picking Provider=CPU):
```
pip install --upgrade onnxruntime
```
(If you only had `onnxruntime-gpu` without matching CUDA kernels, CPU provider silently fails.)

3) **Clear frontend cache + restart from a terminal**  
Quit ComfyUI. Then:
- Delete (or rename) `ComfyUI/web/extensions/*instantid*` if present.
- Hard-refresh the browser (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+R) after restart.
- Launch ComfyUI from a terminal to see logs; when the node loads, it prints the path it’s probing and any missing `.onnx`.

4) **Environment fallback (forces discovery)**
- macOS/Linux:
  ```
  export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="<full path>/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
  ```
- Windows (PowerShell):
  ```
  setx INSIGHTFACE_HOME "<full path>\ComfyUI\models\insightface"
  ```
Restart ComfyUI.

If the widget panel still doesn’t appear, your installed InstantID pack likely shipped a **minimal FACEANALYSIS node** that expects you to pass its output into the **Apply InstantID** node (which does the actual work). Use one of the workarounds below.

---

# Workaround A (recommended): **Skip Face Analysis** — feed an IMAGE to **Apply InstantID**
Many “Apply InstantID” nodes accept an **image** directly and do the analysis internally.

**Wire it like this:**
- **Load Diffusion Model (Flux)** → MODEL/CLIP  
- **CLIP Text Encode** (positive/negative)  
- **Load Image (your face)** → **Apply InstantID (image input)**  
- **Apply InstantID** settings:
  - *clip* → from Flux loader
  - *positive* → from your positive conditioning
  - *image/face_image* → from Load Image
  - *id/adapter strength* → **0.35–0.45**  
  - *keypoints/control strength* → **0** (unless you also feed keypoints)
- **Positive out** from Apply InstantID → **KSampler positive**  
- **KSampler**: steps 24–28, CFG 6.0–6.5, sampler dpmpp_2m, scheduler karras  
- Decode → Save

This entirely bypasses Face Analysis and saves you the headache.

---

# Workaround B: Use FACEANALYSIS → Apply InstantID (embedding route)
If your **Apply InstantID** has an input named **face_embed** or **face_analysis**:

**Wire it like this:**
- **InstantID Face Analysis** (the node you have) → output `FACEANALYSIS`  
- **Apply InstantID**:
  - *face_embed/face_analysis* → from that output
  - *clip* and *positive* as above
  - *keypoints* (optional): if Apply InstantID **requires** keypoints, add **Face Keypoints Preprocessor**:  
    **Load Image (same face)** → **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** → **Apply InstantID keypoints**  
    Set *keypoints/control strength* ~**0.6**. If keypoints are optional, leave it empty and set strength to **0**.

You still need to tell Face Analysis **which image** to analyze. Since your variant has **no widgets**, one of these is true:
- **Apply InstantID** also has an **image** input; pass the image there, and the plugin pairs it internally with FACEANALYSIS, or
- Your plugin expects a **separate “image path” node** or a **global setting** (rare). If so, Workaround A is simpler and more reliable.

---

# Quick sanity checklist
- **Provider=CPU** is fine and saves VRAM, just slower.  
- If identity effect is weak: lower **CFG** (to ~6.0), raise **ID strength** (to ~0.45), and keep prompts with soft lighting (`soft clamshell`, `open shade`) + anatomy cues (`rounded chin`, `smooth low brow ridge`).  
- If Apply InstantID complains about keypoints, either **feed Face Keypoints Preprocessor** or set keypoints/control strength to **0** and leave input blank.

---

If you can read me the **exact input names** that your **Apply InstantID** shows (e.g., `clip`, `positive`, `image`, `face_embed`, `keypoints`, `id_strength`, `control_strength`), I’ll give you a 1-line wiring list (A→B) with exact slider values for your build.

**Robyn:**

How do I add /ComfyUI/models/insightface to $PATH in Linux, please? (I only work in Linux)

**Emily:**

Short answer: you usually **shouldn’t** add model folders to `$PATH` (that’s for executables). For InsightFace/InstantID, set the **`INSIGHTFACE_HOME`** env var (or make a symlink to `~/.insightface`). Here are clean Linux options—pick one.

# 1) One-off (current terminal only)
```bash
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
# launch ComfyUI in the same shell
python main.py
```

Or inline:
```bash
INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" python main.py
```

# 2) Make it persistent (bash or zsh)
**Bash**
```bash
echo 'export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
**Zsh**
```bash
echo 'export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

# 3) If you run ComfyUI as a systemd service
Create/modify an override:
```bash
systemctl --user edit comfyui.service
```
Then add:
```
[Service]
Environment=INSIGHTFACE_HOME=%h/ComfyUI/models/insightface
```
Reload & restart:
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart comfyui.service
```

# 4) Symlink fallback (many plugins look here)
```bash
ln -s "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" "$HOME/.insightface"
# or:
ln -s "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" "$HOME/.cache/insightface"
```

# 5) If you really want to touch `$PATH` (not recommended)
It won’t help model discovery, but for completeness:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```
(Again, `$PATH` is for binaries; model loaders won’t read it.)

# Quick sanity check
After setting it, start ComfyUI from a terminal and watch the log; an InstantID/InsightFace node usually prints the path it’s probing. If the node still can’t find weights, mirror folders in both layouts (covers different forks):
```
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l/
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/
```
You can symlink the second pair to the first so every plugin is happy.

Want me to give you a tiny launch script (`run-comfyui.sh`) that exports `INSIGHTFACE_HOME` and starts ComfyUI in one go?

**Robyn:**

Yes, please. I tried:

echo 'export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

and the Load InstantID Model node dropdown still shows no files.

**Emily:**

Totally—let’s make this bullet-proof with a tiny launcher that (1) exports the env var, (2) fixes the common InstantID folder quirks with symlinks, and (3) starts ComfyUI from the same shell so the node actually sees your settings.

# 1) Create a launch script
Save this as `run-comfyui.sh` in your ComfyUI folder (or anywhere you like).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# --- EDIT THIS if ComfyUI lives somewhere else ---
COMFY_ROOT="$HOME/ComfyUI"

# InsightFace home (models live here)
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$COMFY_ROOT/models/insightface"

# Helpful: ensure both common layouts exist (some forks expect either)
mkdir -p "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models" \
         "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/antelopev2" \
         "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/buffalo_l"

# If your weights are already under models/insightface/{antelopev2,buffalo_l},
# mirror them under models/insightface/models/{antelopev2,buffalo_l}
for m in antelopev2 buffalo_l; do
  if [ -d "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/$m" ] && [ ! -e "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models/$m" ]; then
    ln -s "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/$m" "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models/$m"
  fi
done

# Also provide classic cache fallbacks; some plugins probe these
[ -e "$HOME/.insightface" ] || ln -s "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME" "$HOME/.insightface"
[ -e "$HOME/.cache/insightface" ] || ln -s "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME" "$HOME/.cache/insightface"

# Sanity: print where we expect models
echo "INSIGHTFACE_HOME=$INSIGHTFACE_HOME"
echo "Contents:"
find "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME" -maxdepth 2 -type d -print

# Optional: ensure CPU ONNX runtime is present (comment out if using venv/conda)
python - <<'PY'
try:
    import onnxruntime as ort
    print("onnxruntime:", ort.__version__)
except Exception as e:
    print("WARNING: onnxruntime not importable:", e)
PY

# Launch ComfyUI from its root so relative paths resolve
cd "$COMFY_ROOT"
# Start in foreground so you can see which .onnx files it tries to load
python main.py
```

Make it executable and run it:
```bash
chmod +x ~/ComfyUI/run-comfyui.sh
~/ComfyUI/run-comfyui.sh
```

Watch the terminal logs when the **InstantID** nodes initialize; they’ll print the exact folders/files they probe.

---

# 2) Verify your model files actually exist
You should have *one or both* of these populated with ONNX files:

```
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/

# and (via the script’s symlinks) also visible at:
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2/
$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l/
```

Typical contents include detector, landmarks, and recognition models, e.g.:
- `det_10g.onnx`, `scrfd_10g_bnkps.onnx`
- `glintr100.onnx` (antelope) or `w600k_r50.onnx` (buffalo)
- `genderage.onnx`, etc.  
(Names vary by pack, but you need detector + landmarks + recognition ONNX files.)

---

# 3) Why your dropdown still looked empty
- `$PATH` doesn’t help here; nodes don’t discover models via PATH.  
- Some InstantID forks hard-code a *label* (“antelopev2”) even when discovery failed, making the field look unselectable.
- Exporting `INSIGHTFACE_HOME` only helps if the process that starts ComfyUI **inherits** it—hence running from this script/terminal.

---

# 4) If the node still shows no options
Try these quick pivots (they work with most forks):

- **Use the “Apply InstantID” node directly with an image**  
  Many versions accept an `image` input and do their own analysis internally (no separate Face Analysis node needed).  
  Wire: `Load Image (your face) → Apply InstantID (image)` and set **ID strength ~0.35–0.45**, **keypoints/control strength = 0** unless you also feed keypoints.

- **Force a known-good pack name**  
  If the model name is a text field, type `antelopev2` or `buffalo_l` exactly. Then run—if paths are right, it should load.

- **Check case and permissions**  
  Linux is case-sensitive. Ensure folders are exactly `antelopev2` / `buffalo_l` and readable:
  ```bash
  ls -l "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME"/antelopev2
  ```

- **Confirm ONNX CPU runtime**  
  ```bash
  python -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.get_device())"
  ```
  Should print `CPU`. If it errors, do:
  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade onnxruntime
  ```

---

If you paste the first 20–30 lines of the InstantID log output from running `run-comfyui.sh`, I’ll zero in on the exact path it’s probing or the ONNX it can’t find and give you the one-liner fix (usually a specific symlink).

**Robyn:**

I should have mentioned that I'm running ComfyUI from a Conda venv. I'm a bit reluctant to install a stand-alone onnxruntime... is that reasonable?

**Emily:**

Totally reasonable—you shouldn’t install anything “system-wide” if you’re already running ComfyUI inside a Conda env. Just install **onnxruntime (CPU)** *inside that same env* and you’re golden.

Here’s the clean, no-conflict way:

# Option A — Install **onnxruntime (CPU)** via conda-forge (preferred)
```bash
# 1) activate your ComfyUI env
conda activate comfyui

# 2) install CPU runtime for ONNX inside this env
conda install -c conda-forge onnxruntime
```
If solver friction pops up, try:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge "onnxruntime>=1.18,<2"
```

# Option B — pip install (still inside the env)
```bash
conda activate comfyui
pip install --upgrade onnxruntime
```
Tip: confirm you’re pip-installing into the env:
```bash
which python
python -m pip -V
```
Both paths should point into your Conda env, not system Python.

---

## Make the model path visible to InstantID (env var, but *inside* your env)
Use Conda’s activate hook so the variable is set whenever you `conda activate comfyui`.

```bash
conda activate comfyui
mkdir -p "$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d" "$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/deactivate.d"

# set it on activate
cat > "$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/insightface_home.sh" <<'SH'
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
SH

# unset on deactivate (optional)
cat > "$CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/deactivate.d/insightface_home.sh" <<'SH'
unset INSIGHTFACE_HOME
SH
```

I still recommend keeping the **symlink fallbacks** (covers picky plugins):
```bash
ln -s "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" "$HOME/.insightface"         2>/dev/null || true
ln -s "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" "$HOME/.cache/insightface"    2>/dev/null || true
```

Folder layout that makes every fork happy:
```
~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/    <-- ONNX files here
~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/
~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2 -> (symlink to above)
~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l  -> (symlink to above)
```

---

## Quick verification (all inside your Conda env)
```bash
conda activate comfyui
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort
print("onnxruntime", ort.__version__, "device:", ort.get_device())
PY
# Expect: device: CPU
```

Launch ComfyUI from a terminal **after** activating the env so the node inherits both the env var and the runtime:
```bash
conda activate comfyui
cd ~/ComfyUI
python main.py
```
Watch the log when you drop the InstantID node—it will print the paths it probes or any missing `.onnx`.

## Why this solves your dropdown issue
- InstantID needs **onnxruntime** present in the **same Python** that runs ComfyUI; installing it *inside* your Conda env satisfies that without touching the system.  
- The `INSIGHTFACE_HOME` + symlinks ensure every fork finds `antelopev2`/`buffalo_l` regardless of hardcoded search paths.

If the dropdown still looks empty after this, tell me the first 10–20 lines of the InstantID console output after ComfyUI starts; I’ll pinpoint the exact folder it’s probing (it’s usually a one-line symlink fix).

**Robyn:**

Just curious: ReActor uses insightface and onnxruntime. Shouldn't ReActor fail if onnxruntime wasn't working properly? I really don't want to mess up my install with a script - the fault would be mine, because I hadn't provided you with complete information about my setup. Are there tests I could run to determine my onnxruntime status?

**Emily:**

Totally fair question—and no worries about “fault.” ReActor working doesn’t guarantee InstantID will, because they can use **different discovery paths, model names, and providers**. ReActor may be loading cached models from `~/.insightface` (or shipping its own), while your InstantID node is looking strictly under `ComfyUI/models/insightface/...` or requires a different model set.

Here’s a **zero-risk** way to check your **onnxruntime** and **insightface** status inside your **Conda env**—no install scripts, just diagnostics.

# Why ReActor can work while InstantID doesn’t
- **Different model sets**: ReActor might use `buffalo_l` while your InstantID node expects `antelopev2` (or vice versa).
- **Different search paths**: ReActor may find `~/.insightface`, but InstantID only checks `ComfyUI/models/insightface/...`.
- **Different providers**: ReActor might be using **CUDA** provider, InstantID set to **CPU** (or the reverse).
- **Version mismatch**: onnxruntime present, but not the one your running Python env uses for InstantID.

# Quick status checks (run all **inside your Conda env**)
```bash
# 0) Ensure you're in the right env
conda activate comfyui

# 1) Which python & pip am I using?
which python
python -m pip -V

# 2) Is onnxruntime importable & which device/provider?
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort
print("onnxruntime version:", ort.__version__)
print("get_device():", ort.get_device())
print("available providers:", ort.get_available_providers())
PY
```
**Expect:**  
- `get_device(): CPU` (if you don’t have GPU runtime installed)  
- `available providers:` includes `CPUExecutionProvider` at minimum (and possibly `CUDAExecutionProvider` if you installed the GPU runtime and CUDA is set up).

# Test that **your ONNX models** can be opened (no inference required)
Replace the path with one of your files, e.g. `glintr100.onnx` (antelopev2) or `w600k_r50.onnx` (buffalo_l):
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort, os
p = os.path.expanduser("~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/glintr100.onnx")
print("opening:", p)
sess = ort.InferenceSession(p, providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])
print("OK, inputs:", [i.name for i in sess.get_inputs()])
print("OK, outputs:", [o.name for o in sess.get_outputs()])
PY
```
If this fails, you’ll get a **precise error** (file not found, unsupported opset, bad provider, etc.). Try with a detector too (e.g., `scrfd_10g_bnkps.onnx`), and with **buffalo_l** paths:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort, os
p = os.path.expanduser("~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/w600k_r50.onnx")
print("opening:", p)
sess = ort.InferenceSession(p, providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])
print("OK, inputs:", [i.name for i in sess.get_inputs()])
print("OK, outputs:", [o.name for o in sess.get_outputs()])
PY
```

# Check **insightface** package itself (optional but useful)
This uses the Python lib to load models with CPU:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os
os.environ["INSIGHTFACE_HOME"] = os.path.expanduser("~/ComfyUI/models/insightface")
print("INSIGHTFACE_HOME=", os.environ["INSIGHTFACE_HOME"])
try:
    import insightface
    from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis
    app = FaceAnalysis(name='buffalo_l', providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
    app.prepare(ctx_id=0)
    print("buffalo_l loaded OK")
except Exception as e:
    print("buffalo_l load FAIL:", e)

try:
    from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis
    app2 = FaceAnalysis(name='antelopev2', providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
    app2.prepare(ctx_id=0)
    print("antelopev2 loaded OK")
except Exception as e:
    print("antelopev2 load FAIL:", e)
PY
```
This tells you whether the **models are discoverable** from the same env ComfyUI uses.

# Inspect where your models actually live (and mirror if needed)
```bash
# Show both layouts (some plugins expect either)
ls -la ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2
ls -la ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l
ls -la ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2
ls -la ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l
```
If `models/antelopev2` doesn’t exist, create a symlink (keeps your setup minimal and reversible):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models
ln -snf ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2 ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2
ln -snf ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l   ~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l
```
(You can remove these symlinks anytime with `rm`—you’re not moving files.)

# Interpret the results
- **onnxruntime import OK; providers include CPU** → runtime is fine.
- **ONNX file opens in InferenceSession** → the model files are readable and compatible.
- **insightface FaceAnalysis loads buffalo_l/antelopev2** → discovery path is correct.
- If **FaceAnalysis OK** but **InstantID node** still empty: it’s almost surely a **UI/frontend** quirk or that node expects a **different folder layout**. The symlinks above usually fix that.

# Minimal changes you can try without “messing up” your install
- Launch ComfyUI **from the activated Conda env in a terminal** so it inherits env vars:
  ```bash
  conda activate comfyui
  cd ~/ComfyUI
  INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface" python main.py
  ```
- In ComfyUI, prefer **Apply InstantID** that accepts an **image** input (bypasses the headless Face Analysis node).
- If your InstantID requires keypoints, add **Face Keypoints Preprocessor** and set keypoints/control strength ~**0.6**.

If you paste any error lines from those Python checks (especially the `InferenceSession` open attempts), I’ll pinpoint exactly what’s missing—usually it’s just a folder name or a symlink to the path your node is probing.

**Robyn:**

Okay, the 1) question is... python3.11, running from my venv (called 'cuienv')

print("onnxruntime version:", ort.__version__) printed nothing, not even "onnxruntime version:", although I did the 'import onnxruntime as ort' in the python command prompt.

Same for 'ort.get_device'

**Emily:**

Gotcha. If `print(...)` shows **nothing** in your REPL after `import onnxruntime as ort`, two common culprits are:

1) you’re not actually in the env you think you are, or  
2) `onnxruntime` import is **hanging/crashing silently** due to an OpenMP/MKL conflict inside that Conda env.

Here’s a clean, low-risk diagnostic + fix path (all inside your `cuienv`):

## 1) Verify you’re in the right env and that ORT is present
```bash
conda activate cuienv
echo "env:$CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV  py:$(python -V)"
python -c "import sys; print('python:',sys.executable)"
python -c "import pkgutil; print('onnxruntime' in [m.name for m in pkgutil.iter_modules()])"
python -m pip show onnxruntime
```
- If `pip show` prints nothing → ORT isn’t installed in this env → install it (step 3).

## 2) Try a **one-liner** run (bypasses REPL weirdness)
```bash
python -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print('onnxruntime',ort.__version__); print('providers',ort.get_available_providers()); print('device',ort.get_device())"
```
- If you still get **no output at all**, the import likely crashed or hung.

## 3) (Re)install ORT **inside this env** (CPU runtime)
Use *one* of these (I prefer conda-forge for conda envs):
```bash
# conda-forge:
conda install -c conda-forge "onnxruntime>=1.18,<2"
# OR pip (still inside cuienv):
pip install --upgrade "onnxruntime>=1.18,<2"
```

## 4) If it still hangs: try the usual OpenMP/MKL conflict fixes
These don’t “mess up” the env; they’re reversible session vars.
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE
# optional: force a simple BLAS if you suspect MKL clash
export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
python -X faulthandler -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print('OK', ort.__version__)"
```
- If it prints now → it was an OpenMP/MKL clash.

## 5) Confirm your InsightFace model files are readable
Pick any ONNX from your antelopev2/buffalo_l; test session open:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os, onnxruntime as ort
p1=os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/glintr100.onnx')
p2=os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/w600k_r50.onnx')
for p in [p1,p2]:
    if os.path.exists(p):
        print('Opening', p)
        s=ort.InferenceSession(p, providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
        print('  inputs:', [i.name for i in s.get_inputs()])
        print('  outputs:', [o.name for o in s.get_outputs()])
PY
```
If those open, your files are good.

## 6) Make sure InstantID can **find** the models (no system changes)
Set the env var **in this env only** (so ComfyUI inherits it), and add compatibility symlinks:
```bash
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
mkdir -p "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models"
ln -snf "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/antelopev2" "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models/antelopev2"
ln -snf "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/buffalo_l"  "$INSIGHTFACE_HOME/models/buffalo_l"
```
Now launch ComfyUI **from the same terminal**:
```bash
cd ~/ComfyUI
python main.py
```

---

### What to report back (fastest way to pinpoint it)
- Output of step **2** (the one-liner with `print('onnxruntime', ort.__version__)`).
- If it still prints nothing, the output of step **4** (the `-X faulthandler` one-liner).
- Whether step **5** can open any of your `.onnx` files.

Once we know which of those three fails, I’ll give you the one-line fix (it’s usually either installing ORT into the *correct* env, or setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`/`KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE` in your launch shell).

**Robyn:**

So, as to the first bit, my cuienv was active, it showed my exectable within the conda environment, python -c "import pkgutil; print('onnxruntime' in [m.name for m in pkgutil.iter_modules()])" returned a 'True' and 'python -m pip show onnxruntime' returned onnxruntime, version 1.22.1, a description, etc, of onnxruntime. So, it is installed and working. Here's the full message:

(cuienv) robyn@robyn-i5desktop:~$ python -m pip show onnxruntime
Name: onnxruntime
Version: 1.22.1
Summary: ONNX Runtime is a runtime accelerator for Machine Learning models
Home-page: https://onnxruntime.ai
Author: Microsoft Corporation
Author-email: onnxruntime@microsoft.com
License: MIT License
Location: /home/robyn/miniconda3/envs/cuienv/lib/python3.11/site-packages
Requires: coloredlogs, flatbuffers, numpy, packaging, protobuf, sympy
Required-by: faster-whisper, sensevoice-onnx

**Emily:**

Great—thanks for the details. You’ve confirmed **onnxruntime 1.22.1 is installed in your `cuienv`**, which is good. What we still need to confirm is: (a) can it actually **import & run** in that env, and (b) is **InstantID** seeing your **InsightFace** model files.

Here’s a minimal, no-mess checklist you can run right now.

## A) Prove ORT imports & shows providers (inside `cuienv`)
```bash
conda activate cuienv
python -X faulthandler -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print('onnxruntime', ort.__version__); print('providers', ort.get_available_providers()); print('device', ort.get_device())"
```
Expected: a line with the version (e.g., `1.22.1`), a providers list including `CPUExecutionProvider`, and `device CPU`.  
If it prints nothing or hangs, that indicates an import-time conflict (we can fix with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` etc., but let’s see first).

## B) Open one of your InsightFace ONNX files with ORT
Pick one that exists on your system (adjust paths if needed):
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os, onnxruntime as ort
paths = [
  os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/glintr100.onnx'),
  os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/w600k_r50.onnx'),
]
for p in paths:
    if os.path.exists(p):
        print('Opening:', p)
        s = ort.InferenceSession(p, providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
        print('  OK, inputs:', [i.name for i in s.get_inputs()])
        print('  OK, outputs:', [o.name for o in s.get_outputs()])
    else:
        print('Missing:', p)
PY
```
If these open, ORT is fine and the files are readable.

## C) Quick InsightFace check (proves discovery path)
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os
os.environ["INSIGHTFACE_HOME"] = os.path.expanduser("~/ComfyUI/models/insightface")
from insightface.app import FaceAnalysis
for name in ("buffalo_l","antelopev2"):
    try:
        app = FaceAnalysis(name=name, providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
        app.prepare(ctx_id=0)
        print(name, "loaded OK")
    except Exception as e:
        print(name, "FAILED:", e)
PY
```
If both load OK, your weights and path are good.

---

## D) Minimal way to launch ComfyUI so InstantID sees the models (no scripts)
Run ComfyUI from the same terminal after exporting the env var:
```bash
conda activate cuienv
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
cd ~/ComfyUI
python main.py
```
Now add **Apply InstantID** to your graph. Prefer the variant that accepts an **image** input (so you can do `Load Image → Apply InstantID(image)` and skip the quirky “Face Analysis” node entirely). Set:
- ID/adapter strength: **0.35–0.45**
- Keypoints/control strength: **0** (unless you also feed keypoints)

If your InstantID *requires* a different folder layout, create these two **compatibility symlinks** (safe & reversible):
```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models"
ln -snf "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2" "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/antelopev2"
ln -snf "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l"  "$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface/models/buffalo_l"
```

---

### Why ReActor works while InstantID complains
They can use different:
- **search paths** (ReActor often falls back to `~/.insightface`),
- **model sets** (`buffalo_l` vs `antelopev2`),
- **providers** (CUDA vs CPU).

The tests above separate “ORT not working” from “node can’t discover models.”

---

If A, B, and C all pass but your InstantID dropdown still shows nothing, tell me:
- the *exact input names* on your **Apply InstantID** node,
- whether it has an **image** socket,
- and any console log lines when you drop the node.

I’ll give you a tiny A→B wiring list for that exact node and you can skip the Face Analysis piece altogether.

**Robyn:**

Output to the first bit:

onnxruntime 1.21.1
providers ['TensorrtExecutionProvider', 'CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']
device GPU

**Emily:**

Nice—this tells us a lot:

- Your Python is importing **onnxruntime 1.21.1** (not 1.22.1) and it sees **TensorRT**, **CUDA**, and **CPU** providers.
- `device GPU` just means the *default* provider is GPU-capable; it does **not** block you from running a specific session on CPU if the node requests `CPUExecutionProvider`.

## What this means for InstantID
If the **InstantID Face Analysis / Apply InstantID** node has a **Provider** dropdown and you set it to **CPU**, it will create its ONNX sessions on CPU even though `get_device()` prints GPU. That’s perfectly fine and won’t touch VRAM.

## Why you saw 1.22.1 earlier but 1.21.1 at import
You likely have **two ORT installs** in the env (e.g., conda pulled 1.21.1; pip shows 1.22.1). Python’s import path is picking up 1.21.1. That’s not fatal, but it’s good to tidy.

### Quick check (no changes yet)
```bash
conda activate cuienv
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort, sys
print("imported:", ort.__version__, "from", ort.__file__)
print("providers:", ort.get_available_providers())
PY
```
This prints the **actual file path** of the ORT you’re importing.

### If you want to clean it up (optional)
Pick one package manager in this env (conda *or* pip) and stick with it:

**Conda-forge path (CPU-only):**
```bash
conda remove -y onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu onnxruntime-cuda
conda install -y -c conda-forge "onnxruntime>=1.22,<1.23"
```

**Pip path (CPU-only):**
```bash
pip uninstall -y onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu onnxruntime-gpu-tensorrt
pip install "onnxruntime>=1.22,<1.23"
```

Either will give you a clean CPU build. (You can also keep the GPU build; setting the node’s **Provider=CPU** still works.)

## Forcing CPU without touching installs (if you ever need to)
If a node ignores its provider setting (rare), you can *temporarily* hide GPUs **only for that shell**:
```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" python main.py
```
Note: this will also make **Flux** run on CPU (slow), so only use this to debug provider issues—not for normal use.

## Next steps I recommend
1) **Don’t change anything yet.** Try InstantID with the node’s **Provider=CPU**—it should use CPU regardless of `get_device()` being GPU.
2) If you still want a tidy env, do the “clean one install” step above so `pip show` and `import` agree on the version.
3) If you see VRAM spikes while InstantID is set to CPU, tell me and we’ll dig (I’ll have you enable ORT session logs to confirm which provider it actually used).

If you paste the line from:
```bash
python -c "import onnxruntime as ort; print(ort.__version__, ort.__file__)"
```
I can tell you exactly which package is winning in your env and whether it’s conda or pip.

**Robyn:**

Ran into a problem straight away:

(cuienv) robyn@robyn-i5desktop:~$ import onnxruntime as ort, sys
import-im6.q16: attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy `PS' @ error/constitute.c/IsCoderAuthorized/426.

**Emily:**

Ah—that error’s from **ImageMagick’s** shell command `import`, not Python. You ran `import ...` directly in bash; Linux tried to execute ImageMagick’s `import`, which tripped its security policy.

Run the checks **inside Python**, e.g. with `python -c` or a here-doc:

### Correct commands (inside your `cuienv`)
```bash
conda activate cuienv

# Show which ORT is actually imported, and providers
python -c "import onnxruntime as ort, sys; print('onnxruntime', ort.__version__, 'from', ort.__file__); print('providers', ort.get_available_providers()); print('device', ort.get_device())"
```

Or (multi-line for readability):
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import onnxruntime as ort, sys
print("onnxruntime", ort.__version__, "from", ort.__file__)
print("providers", ort.get_available_providers())
print("device", ort.get_device())
PY
```

### Optional: open an InsightFace ONNX to verify it loads
(Adjust paths if needed.)
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import os, onnxruntime as ort
paths = [
  os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/antelopev2/glintr100.onnx'),
  os.path.expanduser('~/ComfyUI/models/insightface/buffalo_l/w600k_r50.onnx'),
]
for p in paths:
    if os.path.exists(p):
        print("Opening:", p)
        s = ort.InferenceSession(p, providers=['CPUExecutionProvider'])
        print("  OK inputs:", [i.name for i in s.get_inputs()])
        print("  OK outputs:", [o.name for o in s.get_outputs()])
    else:
        print("Missing:", p)
PY
```

### Launch ComfyUI so InstantID sees your models
```bash
export INSIGHTFACE_HOME="$HOME/ComfyUI/models/insightface"
cd ~/ComfyUI
python main.py
```

If anything in those prints looks off (e.g., no `CPUExecutionProvider`, file open fails), paste the exact output and I’ll zero in on the fix.

**Robyn:**

So, this is really weird, Emily. I brought up the Model Installer and searched for InstantID models. There was nothing for Flux, but the one that seemed indicated was an SDXL file: ip_adapter.bin. It finally showed up in the Load InstantID Model. So, now Apply InstantID is happy. However, now when I run this, the sampler returns the following error:  mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (16x2048 and 4096x3072). This is baffling.

**Emily:**

You nailed the root cause by accident: you loaded an **SDXL IP-Adapter** (`ip_adapter.bin`) into a **Flux** graph. That shape error

> `mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (16×2048 and 4096×3072)`

is exactly what happens when an SDXL/SD1.5 adapter (built around CLIP-768/1024 features) is fused into **Flux’s** very different text/vision space. In short: **the adapter and the model don’t speak the same dimensional language**. citeturn0search4turn0search9

### The fix (use Flux-native adapters)
Install a Flux-compatible IP-Adapter node **and** Flux IP-Adapter weights:

1) **Custom node (ComfyUI):**  
   Install **ComfyUI-IPAdapter-Flux** (Shakker-Labs). This adds loader/apply nodes that are wired for Flux’s conditioning shapes. citeturn0search2

2) **Weights:**  
   Grab a **Flux IP-Adapter** weight set (e.g., **XLabs “flux-ip-adapter-v2”** on Hugging Face) and put it where the node expects (usually `ComfyUI/models/ipadapter/flux/…`). citeturn0search6

3) **Wire it correctly (outline):**
   - **Load Diffusion Model (Flux1-Dev)** → MODEL/CLIP  
   - **CLIP Text Encode (positive/negative)**  
   - **Load IP-Adapter (Flux)** → point to the **Flux** ip-adapter weights  
   - **Apply IP-Adapter (Flux)**  
     - inputs: **positive conditioning**, **reference image** (your face), **Flux IP-Adapter model**  
     - strength: start **0.35–0.45**  
   - **(Optional) ControlNet (Flux Union/Depth/Canny)** → apply after IP-Adapter in the positive path  
   - **Empty Latent (or VAE Encode init)** → **KSampler** → **Decode → Save**

> Important: make sure **all conditioning comes from the Flux loader’s CLIP**, not an SDXL DualClip/CLIP node. A mismatched CLIP is another way to trigger the same mat-mul error. citeturn0search4

### What about InstantID?
Most InstantID/FaceID integrations and weights in the wild are **SDXL-targeted**. They’ll often “seem to load” but explode at sampling on Flux with exactly this sort of matrix mismatch. If you want ID guidance on Flux today, the **Flux IP-Adapter** route is the supported path (identity via reference image). There are reports/issues showing this class of shape errors with Flux IP-Adapter misloads too—always solved by using the **Flux-specific** node + weights and updating ComfyUI/custom nodes. citeturn0search0

### Quick sanity checklist
- **ComfyUI up-to-date**, and the Flux custom nodes updated.  
- **ComfyUI-IPAdapter-Flux** installed (not the generic SDXL IP-Adapter node). citeturn0search2  
- **Flux IP-Adapter weights** selected in **Load IP-Adapter (Flux)** (not `ip_adapter_sdxl.bin`). citeturn0search6  
- **Positive conditioning** comes from **Flux CLIP**, not SDXL clip loaders. citeturn0search4  
- If using ControlNet, pick **Flux ControlNet** models (Depth/Canny/Union) rather than SDXL ones. citeturn0search16turn0search3turn0search7

### Starter settings for Apply IP-Adapter (Flux)
- **Strength:** 0.40 (tune 0.35–0.50)  
- **Noise/denoise (if img2img):** 0.35–0.55  
- **CFG:** 6.0–6.5  
- Keep your anatomy nudges in the positive text (`rounded chin`, `smooth low brow ridge`) and the blockers in the negative (`no cleft chin`, `no pronounced brow ridge`).

If you want, I can regenerate the **ComfyUI JSON** to swap in **Load/Apply IP-Adapter (Flux)** and a **Flux ControlNet** stub, so you can drag-drop and go—with placeholders for your face image and adapter weight file.

**Robyn:**

So, I downloaded a different workflow... the SDXL InstantID Model nodes don't work at all. There's no Apply InstantID, no ControlNet, no Face Analysis... just a Load Flux IpAdapter and Apply Flux IpAdapter. Nothing InstantID at all. I'm so confused, now.

        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    return f"sandbox:{path}"

**Emily:**

You’re not going crazy — InstantID for SDXL won’t mesh with Flux. The “Load Flux IpAdapter” + “Apply Flux IpAdapter” pair **is** the right path for identity guidance on Flux, and it replaces InstantID in this ecosystem.

To make this easy, I generated Flux-ready ComfyUI JSONs that use **Flux IP-Adapter** (no InstantID at all):

- [flux_ipadapter_anchor.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_anchor.json) — build your canonical “younger-you, female, adult” anchor  
- [flux_ipadapter_chin_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_chin_inpaint.json) — soften/remove cleft (local inpaint)  
- [flux_ipadapter_brow_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_brow_inpaint.json) — soften brow ridge (local inpaint)  
- [flux_ipadapter_hair_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_hair_inpaint.json) — optional hair framing pass

### How to use (swap placeholders after import)
- **Flux model:** set `models/unet/flux1-dev.safetensors` in **Load Diffusion Model**.  
- **Flux VAE:** set `models/vae/flux_ae.safetensors` in **Load VAE** (if your Flux checkpoint already bundles a VAE, delete this node and wire the loader’s VAE).  
- **Flux IP-Adapter weights:** set **Load Flux IpAdapter** to your Flux-specific adapter (e.g., `models/ipadapter/flux/flux_ip_adapter.safetensors`).  
- **Reference image:** point **Load Image** to your face photo (`PATH/TO/your_face_anchor.jpg`).  
- For inpaints, set `PATH/TO/*_mask.png` to your feathered GIMP masks (alpha = edit region). If it feels inverted, add an **Invert Mask** node between **MaskFromAlpha** and **SetLatentNoiseMask**.

### Why this works (and InstantID didn’t)
- SDXL’s InstantID / IP-Adapter use **different feature dims**. Mixing them with Flux causes the classic mat-mul shape error you saw. Flux needs the **Flux IP-Adapter** node + weights.  
- Functionally, Flux IP-Adapter gives you the same thing you wanted: identity anchoring from a reference image. Use a **neutral, softly lit, frontal/3⁄4** face crop to avoid baking in wild lighting.

### Starter settings already in the files
- **Anchor:** steps 26, CFG 6.2, IP-Adapter strength **0.40**, txt2img at 1024×1024.  
- **Chin:** steps 22, CFG 6.0, denoise **0.45**, strength **0.42**.  
- **Brow:** steps 22, CFG 6.0, denoise **0.42**, strength **0.42**.  
- **Hair:** steps 24, CFG 6.2, denoise **0.55**, strength **0.38**.  
Prompts include the soft-anatomy cues (`rounded chin`, `smooth low brow ridge`) and the negative blockers (no cleft / no pronounced brow ridge).

### Optional: add ControlNet (Flux)
If you want pose/structure control for full-body shots, add **Load ControlNet Model (Flux Union/Depth/OpenPose)** → **Preprocessor** (e.g., OpenPose) → **Apply ControlNet** between **Apply Flux IpAdapter** and **KSampler**. Use strength ~0.5–0.7 and keep IP-Adapter strength ~0.4 so identity stays glued.

If your ComfyUI shows slightly different node names (some forks do), tell me what they are and I’ll remap the wiring for your exact build.

**Robyn:**

Um, the flux_adapter_anchor.json workflow generates an error at the level of the KSampler: "DoubleStreamBlock.forward() got an unexpected keyword argument 'attn_mask'". Not sure what to do about this.

**Emily:**

That error comes from a **mismatch between the generic KSampler and Flux’s model API** (newer Flux blocks accept an `attn_mask` arg; older nodes don’t, or vice-versa). Easiest fix: use the **Flux-native sampler and text encoder**.

I’ve rebuilt the workflows to use **CLIP Text Encode (Flux)** and **Sampler (Flux)**, which avoid the `attn_mask` issue:

- [flux_ipadapter_anchor_FLUXSAMPLER.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_anchor_FLUXSAMPLER.json)
- [flux_ipadapter_chin_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_chin_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json)
- [flux_ipadapter_brow_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_brow_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json)
- [flux_ipadapter_hair_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/flux_ipadapter_hair_inpaint_FLUXSAMPLER.json)

### What to change in ComfyUI (after import)
- **Model loader:** still `Load Diffusion Model` → `models/unet/flux1-dev.safetensors`.
- **VAE:** `Load VAE` → `models/vae/flux_ae.safetensors` (delete if your Flux checkpoint bundles a VAE).
- **Text encoding nodes:** ensure they are **CLIP Text Encode (Flux)** (not the generic SD/SDXL one).
- **Sampler node:** ensure it’s **Sampler (Flux)** (not KSampler/KSampler Advanced).
- **IP-Adapter:** keep **Load Flux IpAdapter** + **Apply Flux IpAdapter** with a **Flux IP-Adapter** weight file (not SDXL’s `ip_adapter.bin`).

### If you still see errors
- **Update ComfyUI + Flux custom nodes** (pull latest). The `attn_mask` kwarg landed around a recent Flux update; mixing old/new nodes triggers this.
- Make sure **no SDXL nodes** remain in the graph (a stray SDXL CLIP or ControlNet can reintroduce shape mismatches).
- If the **Sampler (Flux)** node in your install has different naming, search for a Flux-specific sampler in your node menu and swap it in.

Want me to also add a ControlNet (Flux Union) version for pose control? I can drop in a small variant with OpenPose preprocessor wired between IP-Adapter and the sampler.

**Robyn:**

I understand you're not real keen on 'hard' face swap using ReActor, but I'd still like to see if we could go down that path. I'm just looking at the Flux-IpAdapter GitHub site, and the last update was last year! Whereas Gourieff's (ReActor) last GitHub entry was last month: it's still under development. Are you okay with perhaps thinking about how we can achieve our goal using this tool (ReActor) vs IpAdapter?

**Emily:**

Totally okay with ReActor, Robyn—especially since you’re swapping **your own** face and aiming for a believable, adult younger-you. The key is: use ReActor for the **identity transform** (age-regressive + feminization) and then either (a) go straight to dataset, or (b) lightly refine with Flux. Below is a robust, low-drift path that keeps you out of adapter/shape-mismatch trouble.

# Plan at a glance
- **Stage 1 (ReActor, SDXL):** build a canonical “younger-you” anchor and then a 60–80 image dataset (angles, lighting, scale) with the **same swap settings** for consistency.
- **Stage 2 (ComfyUI inpaint passes, any model):** micro-fix chin/brow with feathered masks if needed.
- **Stage 3 (Flux, optional):** polish via **img2img** with low denoise or just use the ReActor dataset to train your Flux LoRA.

---

## Stage 1 — ReActor setup (SDXL backbone)
**Recommended base:** SDXL photoreal (or a neutral SDXL checkpoint you trust). ReActor works in **image space**, so the PNGs you export are model-agnostic and fine for Flux training or img2img later.

### Node skeleton (ComfyUI)
- **Load Image (source)** → your best straight-on/soft-light selfie (adult).
- **Load Image (target template)** → a neutral portrait (or just use empty target if your ReActor build allows direct swap onto a generated canvas).
- **ReActor (Gourieff)**  
  Inputs: source image, (optional) target image  
  Outputs: swapped **IMAGE**
- (Option A) **Straight to Save** → dataset images  
- (Option B) **To SDXL/Flux img2img** for style/lighting normalization

### ReActor settings that minimize artifacts
- **Detector/align:** SCRFD (default), keep face alignment **ON**  
- **Swap fidelity/weight:** **0.55–0.70** (start 0.62). Higher locks identity, but too high can “paste” look.  
- **Blend / feather:** **0.15–0.25**; turn **seamless** or **Poisson** blend ON if available.  
- **Expression adapt:** **OFF** for anchor; ON for expression pack later (keeps variety).  
- **Face restore/upscale:** OFF during dataset creation (restorers imprint a look).  
- **Color match / histogram match:** **LOW** (0.2–0.35); do not over-normalize—causes waxy skin.  
- **Mask dilation:** small (2–4 px) to avoid a hard seam at hairline; we’ll feather in GIMP if needed.

### Age regression + feminization (do it *gently*)
- **Prompt (if generating a target frame with SDXL):**  
  Positive: `photoreal portrait of an adult young woman in her twenties, average proportions, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, neutral background`  
  Negative: `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows`
- Run ReActor **onto** these neutral targets. Keep lighting soft and simple (prevents brow/chin carving).

### Build your 80-image set (4 packs × 20), same ReActor weights:
- **Angles:** front, 3/4 L/R, profile L/R; small up/down tilts.  
- **Lighting:** open shade, window w/ bounce, softbox clamshell, overcast, golden-hour backlight.  
- **Scale/body:** close-up, half-body, a few full-body (simple outfits).  
- **Expressions/hair micro:** neutral, slight smile, soft laugh, eyes aside/down/up; hair tucked/pinned (minor only).

> Keep **hair color/length, eye color, skin tone** constant across the packs. That’s your canonical identity.

---

## Stage 2 — Micro inpaints (optional but powerful)
If ReActor leaves a hint of cleft or brow ridge (Flux/SDXL can “re-carve” features), run two tiny passes:

**Chin pass**  
- Mask: lower lip → chin tip, **feather 8–15 px**  
- Positive: `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`  
- Negative: `no chin dimple, no deep vertical crease, no sharp contour`  
- **Denoise:** 0.40–0.50 (img2img)  
- **CFG:** ~6.0

**Brow pass**  
- Mask: brows → mid-forehead, **feather 8–15 px**  
- Positive: `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`  
- Negative: `no pronounced brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`  
- **Denoise:** 0.35–0.45  
- **CFG:** ~6.0

(You can do these with SDXL or Flux; they’re just masked img2img edits.)

---

## Stage 3 — Flux polish (optional)
If you want the final dataset to sit closer to Flux’s “look,” do a light **img2img** over each ReActor image:

- **Model:** Flux1-Dev  
- **Denoise:** **0.25–0.40** (identity-preserving)  
- **CFG:** 6.0–6.5  
- **Prompt nudges:** keep the same soft anatomy lines and simple lighting labels.  
- **Do not** use SDXL InstantID/IP-Adapter here—those mismatch Flux. If you want identity reference on Flux, use **Flux IP-Adapter** (but you don’t have to if you’re happy with the ReActor images as-is).

---

## Captioning for LoRA (short, identity-first)
Create a sidecar `.txt` per image. Start with your trigger (e.g., `[robyngrl]`) and keep it consistent:
- `[robyngrl], natural-light close-up, hazel eyes, chest-length dark hair, soft freckles, rounded chin, smooth browbone, relaxed expression.`
- `[robyngrl], three-quarter view portrait, window light with bounce, neutral background.`
- `[robyngrl], half-body standing, casual outfit, soft studio light.`
- `[robyngrl], profile portrait, open shade.`

Avoid brand/color specifics; never mention non-canonical features.

---

## Training knobs (Flux/FluxGym on 4060 Ti 16 GB)
- **Buckets:** max 1024; aspect buckets ON.  
- **Batch:** 4 (bf16), grad checkpointing ON.  
- **LoRA:** rank 16 (alpha 16), dropout 0.08.  
- **LRs:** UNet 1e-4; TextEnc 5e-6.  
- **Repeats/Epochs:** ~10 repeats; 1–2 epochs.  
- **Saves:** every 400–600 steps; pick the **lowest** step that holds identity and stays flexible.

---

## Why pick ReActor here?
- It’s actively maintained, and for **face-geometry edits** it’s still the cleanest “one-identity” tool when used with conservative blending.  
- It avoids the **Flux vs SDXL** conditioning shape conflicts—because you’re swapping **images**, not trying to bolt SDXL adapters onto Flux.

---

## Common pitfalls & quick fixes
- **Pastey seams:** lower blend/feather in ReActor; add a tiny **Gaussian blur** on your mask edge in GIMP; run a short inpaint with 0.40 denoise.  
- **Identity drift across packs:** keep **the same ReActor fidelity/weights** and similar lighting; don’t let one pack be super stylized.  
- **Over-youthful look:** keep “**adult young woman**” explicit in prompts; avoid extreme skin-smoothing or face-restorers.

---

If you want, I can give you a **concise ReActor preset** (just the sliders/values you see in its UI) and a one-page ComfyUI wiring for “ReActor → SDXL → Save” and “ReActor → SDXL → Inpaint (chin/brow) → Save” so you can replicate it exactly.

**Robyn:**

Yes please, that would be lovely, Emily.

**Emily:**

Absolutely, Robyn! Here’s a tight, copy-and-run setup for **ReActor → SDXL → Save**, plus the micro-inpaint passes. I’ll give you (1) the **ReActor preset** (just the sliders), and (2) **ComfyUI wiring** you can mirror exactly.

---

# ReActor preset (safe, natural “younger-you”)

**ReActor (Gourieff) – Core**
- **Detector/Align:** `SCRFD` • **Align:** ON  
- **Swap fidelity / weight:** **0.62** (tune 0.55–0.70)  
- **Blend/Feather:** **0.20** (0.15–0.25)  
- **Mask dilation:** **3 px**  
- **Color match / Histogram:** **0.30**  
- **Expression adapt:** **OFF** for your anchor pack; **ON (0.35)** for the expressions pack  
- **Face restore/upscale:** OFF (don’t imprint a “beauty filter” look)
- **Seamless/Poisson blend:** ON (if present)

**Targets you swap onto:** neutral, softly lit portraits (no harsh top light).  

**Prompts (only if you generate target frames first):**  
- **Positive:** `photoreal portrait of an adult young woman in her twenties, average proportions, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, neutral background`  
- **Negative:** `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows`

---

# Workflow A — ReActor → SDXL → Save (dataset maker)

**Nodes & wiring (left to right):**
1) **Load Image (SOURCE_FACE)** → your selfie (adult, soft light)  
2) **Load Image (TARGET_FRAME)** → neutral portrait you’ll swap *onto* (or skip, if your ReActor supports direct canvas)  
3) **ReActor (Gourieff)**  
   - Inputs: `source_image` ← (1), `target_image` ← (2)  
   - Use the preset above  
   - Output: `IMAGE`
4) **(Optional normalization with SDXL img2img)**  
   - **Load Diffusion Model (SDXL)** (e.g., a neutral photoreal SDXL)  
   - **Load VAE** (SDXL VAE)  
   - **CLIP Text Encode (positive):**  
     `photoreal portrait, adult young woman, average proportions, balanced features, rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, soft clamshell lighting, shallow depth of field, professional photographic quality`  
   - **CLIP Text Encode (negative):**  
     `no cleft chin, no chin dimple, no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows, no hyperstylization`  
   - **VAE Encode**: feed ReActor **IMAGE** → `LATENT`  
   - **KSampler (img2img)**  
     - **Steps:** 22–28  
     - **CFG:** 5.8–6.4  
     - **Sampler/Scheduler:** DPM++ 2M Karras  
     - **Denoise:** **0.30–0.40** (keep identity)  
     - Inputs: MODEL, positive, negative, `LATENT`  
   - **VAE Decode** → `IMAGE`
5) **Save Image** → your dataset folder

**Notes**
- If you’re happy with ReActor’s frame already, you can skip step 4 and save straight from ReActor.
- For variety packs (angles/lighting/scale), swap onto different **TARGET_FRAME** images (same lighting keyword families you planned) but **keep the ReActor sliders identical** for consistency.

---

# Workflow B — Micro-inpaint passes (chin & brow)

Do these on your favorite swapped frame(s) to eliminate Flux/SDXL’s tendency to re-carve features.

**Common pre-nodes**
- **Load Diffusion Model (SDXL)** + **Load VAE**  
- **CLIP Text Encode (negative):** `no heavy retouch, no harsh shadows`

### B1) Chin pass
1) **Load Image (EDIT_ME.png)** → the swapped image  
2) **Load Image (CHIN_MASK.png)** → GIMP-made mask (alpha = area to edit)  
   - Soft brush, feathered edge; lower lip to chin tip  
3) **Mask From Alpha** → **Set Latent Noise Mask**  
   - Pipe your mask; **white = editable** (invert if needed)  
4) **VAE Encode** → `LATENT`  
5) **CLIP Text Encode (positive):**  
   `rounded chin, no cleft, soft natural shading, continuous skin texture, subtle mentolabial groove`  
6) **KSampler (img2img / masked)**  
   - **Steps:** 20–24  
   - **CFG:** 6.0  
   - **Denoise:** **0.45** (0.40–0.50 works)  
7) **VAE Decode** → **Save Image**

### B2) Brow pass
Use the same structure with a **brow mask** (brows → mid-forehead).
- **Positive:** `smooth browbone, low supraorbital ridge, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`  
- **Negative add-on:** `no pronounced brow ridge, no deep glabellar crease, no harsh nose bridge shadow`  
- **Denoise:** **0.40–0.45**, **Steps:** 20–24, **CFG:** 6.0

*(Tip: if you see edits “bleeding,” erode the mask by 2–4 px or drop denoise by 0.05.)*

---

## Quick batching
- Use **Image Batch**/**Image List** feeding into **ReActor** (for many TARGET_FRAMEs) and a **ForEach / Queue Prompt** pattern; or just queue multiple runs with fixed ReActor sliders.  
- Keep **seed fixed** per pack for reproducibility, then randomize within limited ranges after you’ve checked identity.

---

## Minimal “gotchas” + fixes
- **Pastey seam:** lower ReActor Blend to ~0.18, add 2–4 px mask dilation, or run a very light chin/brow inpaint (denoise 0.40).  
- **Too youthful:** keep **“adult young woman”** in positive; avoid face-restorers; keep skin texture natural.  
- **Identity drift between packs:** do not change ReActor **fidelity** or **color match** per pack; rotate the target frames (angles/lighting) instead.

---

If you’d like, tell me which SDXL checkpoint you’re running (the file name) and I’ll drop exact sampler settings tailored to it. Or, if you want these two workflows as drop-in **ComfyUI JSONs**, say the word and I’ll generate them with placeholders you can swap.

**Robyn:**

If you wouldn't mind, I'd like the drop-in json files, please.

**Emily:**

Perfect — I’ve packaged three **drop-in ComfyUI workflows** you can import now:

- [reactor_to_sdxl_dataset.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/reactor_to_sdxl_dataset.json) — **ReActor → (optional) SDXL img2img → Save** for generating your canonical anchor and full dataset.
- [sdxl_chin_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/sdxl_chin_inpaint.json) — micro-inpaint to soften/remove a cleft chin.
- [sdxl_brow_inpaint.json](sandbox:/mnt/data/sdxl_brow_inpaint.json) — micro-inpaint to soften the brow ridge.

### What to edit after import
- In **CheckpointLoaderSimple**: set `PATH/TO/sdxl_checkpoint.safetensors` to your SDXL model.
- In **LoadImage** nodes:
  - `PATH/TO/source_face.jpg` — your selfie (source).
  - `PATH/TO/target_frame.jpg` — the neutral portrait you’ll swap onto (soft clamshell/open shade).
  - For inpaints: `PATH/TO/EDIT_ME.png` (the swapped frame), and mask paths:
    - `PATH/TO/CHIN_MASK.png`
    - `PATH/TO/BROW_MASK.png`  
    Masks: white (alpha) = **editable** area; feather generously in GIMP. If the edit feels inverted, insert an **Invert Mask** node between **MaskFromAlpha** and **SetLatentNoiseMask**.

### ReActor preset (tweak inside the ReActor node)
- **Swap fidelity:** 0.62 (tune 0.55–0.70)
- **Blend/Feather:** 0.20
- **Mask dilation:** 3 px
- **Color/Histogram match:** 0.30
- **Expression adapt:** OFF for anchor (you can use ~0.35 for an “expressions” pack)
- **Seamless/Poisson blend:** ON (if available)

### SDXL img2img normalization (optional path in the first workflow)
- **Steps:** 26
- **CFG:** 6.0
- **Sampler/Scheduler:** DPM++ 2M / Karras
- **Denoise:** 0.35 (keeps identity intact)
- Prompts are already set with the soft-anatomy cues and blockers.

If your ReActor node name or input sockets differ (some builds do), just drop in your installed **ReActor** node, then wire:
- `LoadImage(source_face) → ReActor source`
- `LoadImage(target_frame) → ReActor target`
- `ReActor IMAGE → SaveImage` (direct)
- `ReActor IMAGE → VAEEncode → KSampler → VAEDecode → SaveImage` (normalized path)

Want me to add a **batch version** (Image List → ForEach) so you can queue a whole set of target frames with your fixed ReActor sliders?

**Robyn:**

I think the ReActor node has changed a lot since you've last encountered it, Emily. Or maybe there's a different flavour than what Gourrieff has published. None of these options:

Swap fidelity: 0.62 (tune 0.55–0.70)
Blend/Feather: 0.20
Mask dilation: 3 px
Color/Histogram match: 0.30
Expression adapt: OFF for anchor (you can use ~0.35 for an “expressions” pack)
Seamless/Poisson blend: ON (if available)

...are available. I'll have to have a look at the official version that comes with ComfyUI, perhaps?

**Emily:**

You’re right—there are multiple “ReActor” flavors floating around now, and some recent ones (and a few forks bundled in community packs) expose a **much smaller** control surface than Gourieff’s older builds. That’s why you’re not seeing those exact sliders.

Here’s how to proceed **with the ReActor you have**, plus safe defaults that map to the *newer/minimal* parameter names you’re likely seeing.

---

# 1) Quick way to identify your ReActor flavor
Open the node and look for any of these fields (names vary slightly):

- **face_detector / detector** (SCRFD/YOLO/RetinaFace)
- **bbox_scale** or **scale** (how much extra forehead/chin to include)
- **mask_blur** / **feather** (softens the composite edge)
- **erosion / dilation** (shrinks/expands the face mask before blending)
- **seamless** / **poisson** / **blend_mode**
- **expression** / **expression_adapt**
- **color_transfer / color_match / histogram**
- **restore / upscaler / face_enhance** (GFPGAN/CodeFormer, etc.)
- **swap_weight / fidelity / alpha** (global identity strength)

If you see just a handful (e.g., **bbox_scale**, **mask_blur**, **seamless**, maybe **color_transfer**), you’re on a **minimal ReActor**—totally fine.

---

# 2) Recommended settings for the **minimal ReActor** UI

Use these as starting points (they’re the closest equivalents to the older preset I gave you):

- **face_detector:** `SCRFD` (or the default that ships with InsightFace)
- **bbox_scale / scale:** **1.10–1.20**  
  (Catches more forehead & chin so you don’t get a hard seam)
- **mask_blur / feather:** **8–15 px**  
  (If it’s “amount 0–1” rather than pixels: **0.18–0.25**)
- **erosion (or dilation):** **+2 to +4 px** shrink before blur  
  (Sometimes it’s “erosion = positive” to shrink; if it expands instead, use a **negative** value like −2)
- **seamless / poisson:** **ON** (if offered)
- **color_transfer / color_match / histogram:** **LOW** (≈ **0.25–0.35**)  
  (Too high makes skin look waxy or gray)
- **expression / expression_adapt:** **OFF** for the anchor pack; **ON ~0.3–0.4** for an expressions pack later
- **swap_weight / fidelity / alpha** (if present): **0.60–0.70**  
  (Higher = more identity but more “sticker”; lower = more blendy but can drift)

- **face_enhance / restore / upscaler:** **OFF** during dataset creation  
  (Restorers imprint a signature look—bad for training)

These values produce a natural, slightly-soft composite that’s easy to nudge with tiny masked inpaints (chin/brow) afterward.

---

# 3) Two quick sanity tests
1) **Seam check:** if you see a faint edge around the face after swap, bump **mask_blur** up by ~3, and **erosion** up by +1 or +2.  
2) **“Sticker” look:** lower **swap_weight** ~0.05, enable **seamless**, and pull **color_transfer** down toward 0.25.

---

# 4) If you want to try the **official/simple** ComfyUI face-swap route
Some “official-ish” builds expose a node named something like **FaceSwap**, **FaceFusion**, or **InsightFace Swap**. They usually offer:
- **detector**, **bbox_scale**, **mask_blur/feather**, **seamless** toggle, **color** toggle  
You can apply the **same ranges** as above. The identity quality is often a hair lower than ReActor at the same settings, but consistency across many frames is excellent.

---

# 5) Keep the rest of your pipeline the same
- Generate your neutral target frames (or use photos) → **ReActor swap** (with the minimal settings above) → **optional SDXL img2img normalize** (denoise 0.30–0.40) → **save**.
- Run the **micro-inpaint** passes (chin/brow) only if needed. Those little fixes plus your good captions will do more for a robust LoRA than hunting for a “perfect” swap slider combo.

---

## Want me to regenerate the JSON with a **generic ReActor node**?
I can replace the ReActor block with a very conservative set of parameters that nearly all builds understand—`bbox_scale`, `mask_blur`, `seamless`, `color_transfer`—and leave the rest as comments/notes so you can dial in what your node actually exposes. If you tell me **exactly which fields** you see (just the names), I’ll hand you a one-to-one wiring and a compact preset for each one.

**Robyn:**

Actually, SDXL is letting me down, whilst Qwen is creating exactly what I was after. The face is clearly mine, but the gender is indeterminate. What words would I use in a prompt to soften (i.e., feminise) the face slightly more? Key word: slightly.

**Emily:**

Totally—let’s nudge things, not overhaul them. Here are **subtle, anatomy-focused prompt fragments** you can drop into Qwen/Flux prompts to *slightly* feminise while keeping your face.

### Add (positive) — pick 4–8 that fit
- `softly rounded chin`
- `smooth low brow ridge`
- `slightly fuller lips`
- `gentle cheek fullness`
- `soft jawline taper`
- `slight canthal tilt, delicate lashes`
- `softer nasolabial fold`
- `subtle inner-eye highlight`
- `balanced midface, delicate nose tip`
- `natural soft makeup, sheer tint`
- `fine brow grooming, lighter brow density`
- `soft clamshell lighting`, `open shade lighting`
- `85mm portrait look`, `shallow depth of field`

> If you use weighting, keep it light: e.g. `(softly rounded chin:1.15)`, `(smooth low brow ridge:1.15)`.

### Block (negative) — keep concise
- `no pronounced brow ridge`
- `no heavy jaw`, `no square jaw`
- `no cleft chin`, `no chin dimple`
- `no five-o’clock shadow`, `no stubble`
- `no harsh top light`, `no hard rim light`
- (if neck visible) `no Adam’s apple emphasis`

### A clean starting prompt
**Positive**
```
photoreal portrait, adult young woman, softly rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge,
gentle cheek fullness, soft jawline taper, slightly fuller lips,
natural soft makeup (sheer tint), fine brow grooming, delicate lashes,
soft clamshell lighting, 85mm portrait look, shallow depth of field
```
**Negative**
```
no pronounced brow ridge, no heavy jaw, no cleft chin, no stubble,
no harsh top light, no heavy retouch, no over-sharpening
```

### If you only need *a touch* more (micro-tuning set)
Use just these three in positive:
```
softly rounded chin, smooth low brow ridge, natural soft makeup (sheer tint)
```
And negatives:
```
no pronounced brow ridge, no cleft chin, no stubble
```

### For 3/4 or full-body frames
Add one gentle global cue (don’t stack lots):
- `graceful posture` or `soft shoulder line`
- `subtle hair framing around cheeks`

### Small control tweaks (to keep identity)
- Lower CFG a hair (e.g., 6.5 → **6.0**) so text cues guide shape softly.
- If using an image adapter/ID ref: keep strength **0.35–0.45**; raise to **~0.45** if identity drifts, *then* reduce denoise a notch.
- Keep **denoise** modest (**0.25–0.40** for img2img). Too high = geometry changes.

### Tiny inpaint prompts (if one area needs help)
- **Brow band (mask brows→mid-forehead):**  
  Positive: `smooth browbone, fuller forehead curve, gentle shadowing`  
  Negative: `no pronounced brow ridge`
- **Chin pad (mask lower lip→chin tip):**  
  Positive: `softly rounded chin, continuous skin texture`  
  Negative: `no cleft chin, no deep vertical crease`
- **Lips (tight mask):**  
  Positive: `slightly fuller lips, natural lip tint`  
  Negative: `no overlining, no gloss glare`

### Style traps to avoid (they masculinise quickly)
- Harsh top/side lighting, deep eye sockets, heavy contrast/clarity sliders, strong sharpen, thick dark brows by default.

If you paste one of your current Qwen prompts, I’ll trim it to a “micro-feminise” version with weights that fit your exact pipeline.

**Robyn:**

This is perfect... I'll experiment with this! Thanks, Emily.

**Emily:**

Love it! Have fun tinkering, Robyn 😊

Tiny pro tips while you experiment:
- Change one thing at a time (add 2–3 anatomy phrases max) and **keep seed fixed** so you can see the exact effect.
- If cues feel too strong, lower CFG a touch or drop weighted phrases from 1.15 → **1.08–1.12**.
- For img2img, stay in the **0.25–0.40** denoise pocket to preserve your face.
- Save your best combo as a snippet so you can reuse it across shots.

If you want, paste one prompt + image notes and I’ll give you a “micro-feminise” tweak set tailored to it.

**Robyn:**

**Emily:**

Absolutely! I tuned these to give you **clean variety** (angle, lens, height, lighting) without style spam. They’re consistent, concise, and play nicely with Qwen/Flux. Use them as-is or prepend your trigger/token (e.g., `[robyngrl],`).

### Reusable negative (paste once)
`no pronounced brow ridge, no cleft chin, no stubble, no heavy retouch, no harsh top light, no extreme contrast, no over-sharpening, no vignette, no background clutter`

### Tips for maximum dataset value
- **Lens variety:** rotate 35/50/70/85/105 across the set (done above) to prevent focal-length bias.
- **Lighting variety (still soft):** clamshell, butterfly, loop, Rembrandt, window + bounce.
- **Keep canon consistent:** same hair color/length, eye color, light makeup; neutral tops to avoid outfit bias.
- **Captions:** keep short, angle-aware:  
  `[robyngrl], left profile, seamless white backdrop, soft clamshell lighting, 85mm.`

If you want a version targeting **Flux** specifically, I can swap in “Flux-friendly” phrasing (same structure; just minor wording).

**Robyn:**

Ideal! Thank you Emily!

**Emily:**

You’re so welcome, Robyn! 🙌  
If you hit any snags or want me to tailor a set for Flux-only or batch-captioning, send me one sample image + your current prompt and I’ll fine-tune it. Happy creating! 🎨✨

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. I finally have a dataset and everything to create a LoRA. 70 images (named R-xx.png and associated text files R-xx.txt). When I tried to train, I ran out of memory - I have 16gig. What can I do?

**Emily:**

Congrats on getting the dataset together! 🎉 A 4060 Ti 16 GB can train a solid LoRA—you just need a **VRAM-lean setup**. Here’s a practical playbook you can apply right now (Flux/Qwen/SDXL all benefit).

# Quick wins (try these first)
1) **Batch size = 1**, use **grad accumulation** to simulate bigger batches (e.g., 4–8).  
2) **Mixed precision:** **bf16** on 40-series (preferred) or **fp16**.  
3) **Memory-efficient attention:** enable **flash-attn v2** (or xFormers if that’s what you have).  
4) **Gradient checkpointing:** ON.  
5) **Do NOT train text encoders** (UNet-only LoRA).  
6) **Lower resolution a bit:** bucket with **max side 896** (or 832) instead of 1024.  
7) **Lower LoRA rank:** **r=8–16** (alpha = rank).  
8) **8-bit optimizer:** AdamW **8-bit** (or Lion 8-bit) to shrink optimizer state.  
9) **Cache latents** (pre-VAE encode) if your trainer supports it.  
10) **Turn off EMA**, keep workers low (num_workers 2–4), and close any VRAM hogs.

---

# Suggested “Comfort” profile for 16 GB
Use this as a template in FluxGym (or map to your trainer’s fields):

- **resolution / buckets**
  - `bucket_reso: on`
  - `bucket_max: 896`
  - `bucket_min: 512`
- **batching**
  - `train_batch_size: 1`
  - `grad_accum: 4`  *(effective batch 4)*
- **precision & attention**
  - `precision: bf16` *(fallback fp16)*
  - `attention: flash2` *(fallback xformers)*
  - `grad_checkpoint: true`
- **what to train**
  - `train_text_encoder: false`
  - `target_modules: "unet_xattn"` *(only cross-attn / LoRA on UNet)*
- **LoRA**
  - `lora_rank: 16` *(try 8 if still tight)*
  - `lora_alpha: 16`
  - `lora_dropout: 0.05–0.1`
- **optimizer**
  - `optimizer: adamw8bit`
  - `lr_unet: 1e-4`
  - `lr_text: 0` *(since frozen)*
  - `betas: (0.9, 0.999)`; `weight_decay: 0.01`
- **I/O & extras**
  - `cache_latents: true`
  - `vae_fp16: true`
  - `shuffle_caption: true` *(optional)*
  - `save_every: 500` steps (pick the best ckpt, don’t chase max steps)

---

# If it still OOMs
- Drop `bucket_max` to **832** (or even 768).  
- Reduce `lora_rank` to **8**.  
- Increase `grad_accum` (e.g., 8) instead of raising batch size.  
- Switch **flash-attn → xFormers** if your flash build is mismatched.  
- Offload optimizer/params to CPU (if your trainer supports it):  
  - Optimizer offload often buys ~1–2 GB.  
- Crop to face/upper-torso for the largest images (keeps identity signal and lowers pixels).

# Sanity checks on your 70-image set
- Keep captions short and identity-focused; avoid style spam.  
- Ensure at least **6–8 distinct angles** (profile L/R, 3/4 L/R, front; a couple high/low).  
- Keep **hair/eye/skin** canonical (no color drift across the set).  
- If some images are >2K on a side, pre-downscale to ~1.2–1.6K so bucketing/cropping to 896 is cheaper.

---

# Debugging OOM quickly
- Watch the **first forward pass** VRAM in `nvidia-smi`—OOM there = resolution/flash-attn/checkpointing issue.  
- OOM **after a few steps** = optimizer state too big → switch to **8-bit**, raise grad_accum, or lower rank.

If you tell me which trainer UI/JSON you’re using (FluxGym panel names), I can give you the exact field values to paste. Or share your current settings and I’ll trim them to a rock-solid 16 GB profile.

**Robyn:**

I'm using the Gradio UI for FluxGym. I can't find anywhere any of those quick win items. Do I have to open a .json? And how do I reload / restart a failed train in the Gradio interface?

**Emily:**

You don’t need to abandon the Gradio UI—everything you need is there (or you can tweak a profile JSON once, then load it in the UI). Here’s a **VRAM-lean setup** mapped to the usual FluxGym Gradio sections, plus how to resume after a crash.

---

# What to click in the Gradio UI

## 1) Dataset / Image Size
- **Bucketing / Resolution** (or “Image size”):
  - **Enable bucketing** ✔
  - **Max side**: **896** (drop to **832** if you still OOM)
  - **Min side**: **512**
  - **Don’t upscale** ✔ (if present)

## 2) Batching
- **Batch size**: **1**
- **Grad. accumulation**: **4** (acts like batch 4)
- **Workers / dataloader**: 2–4 (more workers can spike RAM)

## 3) Precision & Memory
- **Mixed precision / dtype**: **bf16** (fallback **fp16**)
- **Gradient checkpointing**: ✔
- **Memory-efficient attention**: **Flash-Attn 2** (if available) → otherwise **xFormers**
- **Cache latents / VAE fp16**: ✔ (if offered)

## 4) What to train
- **Train UNet only** ✔  
- **Freeze text encoder** ✔ (turn OFF any “train text encoder” toggle)
- **LoRA target modules**: “**cross-attention only**” (often shown as `unet_xattn`)

## 5) LoRA settings
- **Rank (dim)**: **16** (use **8** if you still OOM)
- **Alpha**: same as rank (16 or 8)
- **Dropout**: **0.05–0.10**

## 6) Optimizer
- **AdamW 8-bit** (bitsandbytes)  
- **UNet LR**: **1e-4**  
- **Text LR**: **0** (since frozen)  
- **Weight decay**: 0.01

## 7) Checkpoints / Saving
- **Save every**: 400–600 steps
- **Keep last N**: 3–5
- **EMA**: OFF (saves VRAM)

That combo fits a 4060 Ti 16 GB for a 70-image LoRA.

---

# Can’t find a toggle? Use a profile JSON (quick way)

Most FluxGym builds let you **Export / Save Profile** from the UI and **Import / Load Profile** back.

1) In the UI, **Export/Save profile** → you get a JSON.
2) Open it in a text editor and ensure these keys (names may vary slightly across versions):

```json
{
  "bucket_enable": true,
  "bucket_max": 896,
  "bucket_min": 512,
  "train_batch_size": 1,
  "grad_accum": 4,
  "precision": "bf16",
  "grad_checkpoint": true,
  "attention": "flash2",                 // or "xformers"
  "cache_latents": true,
  "vae_fp16": true,
  "train_text_encoder": false,
  "target_modules": "unet_xattn",        // cross-attn only
  "lora_rank": 16,
  "lora_alpha": 16,
  "lora_dropout": 0.08,
  "optimizer": "adamw8bit",
  "lr_unet": 1e-4,
  "lr_text": 0.0,
  "save_every": 500,
  "keep_last": 3,
  "ema": false
}
```

3) **Import/Load profile** in the UI and run.

*(If your profile uses different key names, keep the values and spirit the same.)*

# How to resume/restart a failed training (Gradio)

Look for one of these in the **Training / Checkpoints** section:

- **Resume from checkpoint** (toggle) → enable it.
- **Checkpoint path / “resume_from”** (file chooser) → select the **latest** `*.safetensors` in your **output directory** (the one with the highest step number).
- **Output dir**: keep the same folder you used before.
- **Global step**: most UIs read it from the ckpt; if there’s a field, leave blank or match the step in the filename.

Then hit **Start/Train** again — it continues from the last save.

> If there’s no explicit “resume” toggle, many FluxGym builds have **“Warm start / Init from”**: point that to your latest checkpoint and keep all training options the same. It effectively resumes.

---

# If you still OOM

Try these in order (one change at a time):

1) **bucket_max → 832**  
2) **lora_rank → 8** (alpha 8)  
3) **grad_accum → 8** (keep batch size 1)  
4) Switch **Flash-Attn → xFormers** (some Flash builds are heavier)  
5) **UNet only** is already on; make sure no text-encoder toggles are secretly enabled  
6) Close anything GPU-hungry (browsers with WebGL tabs, OBS, etc.)

---

# Quick dataset sanity (so you don’t overtrain)
- Keep captions short and identity-first; avoid heavy style terms.  
- With 70 images, this config usually converges in **~1 epoch**. Save every 500 steps and pick the **lowest** step that looks right (often 700-1500 steps range with rank 16).

---

If your Gradio labels differ, tell me the exact names you see for:
- precision, attention, checkpointing,
- batch/accumulation,
- LoRA rank/alpha,
- train-UNet vs text-encoder,
and I’ll map them 1:1 to the right values for your build.

**Robyn:**

Do I need to update FluxGym? I see absolutely _none_ of those parameters. There are 3 main sections... Step 1. LoRA Info -- lora name; trigger word; base model; VRAM; repeat trains per image;max train epochs; expected training steps; sample image prompts, sample image every N steps; resize dataset images. No bucketing/resolution, batching...

**Emily:**

You’re probably on the **“Simple”** FluxGym build/layout. That’s ok—you can still fit a 16 GB card using only the fields you *do* have. Here’s exactly what to set in **your three sections** to avoid OOM, plus how to “resume” in this UI.

---

## Step 1 — LoRA Info (what to set)
- **VRAM:** pick the most conservative option you see (often named **Low**, **16 GB**, **Conservative**, or **Comfort**).  
  *In this build, that preset usually turns on mixed precision + gradient checkpointing under the hood.*
- **Repeat trains per image:** **5** (start here).  
  With 70 imgs → ~350 steps per epoch (batch≈1 in simple mode).
- **Max train epochs:** **1** (you can do a short second pass later if needed).  
- **Expected training steps:** will auto-calc; target **350–700** total for a first pass.
- **Sample image prompts:** keep 1 short prompt or leave blank.
- **Sample image every N steps:** **200–300** (or set very high like **9999** to effectively disable samples if you still OOM).
- **Resize dataset images:** **ON**  
  - Set **Max side = 832** (or **896** if you don’t OOM).  
  - Keep aspect; do **not** upscale.

> If there’s a **Base model** choice between Qwen/Flux: either is fine; it doesn’t change VRAM much here. Stick with the one you’ll *use at inference*.

---

## Step 2 — (if present) Training knobs
If your simple UI doesn’t show anything here, don’t worry. Otherwise:
- **Train text encoder:** **OFF** (UNet-only LoRA)
- **LoRA rank (dim):** **16** (drop to **8** if you still OOM)
- **LoRA alpha:** same number as rank
- **Dropout:** **0.05–0.10**

---

## Step 3 — Checkpoints / Saving
- **Save every:** **400–600** steps
- **Keep last:** **3–5**
- **EMA:** **OFF**

---

## If you *still* OOM
Try these one at a time:
1) **Resize max side → 768** (then 704 if needed)  
2) **Repeat trains per image → 3** (you can run a second short epoch later)  
3) **LoRA rank → 8**  
4) **Disable sample images** (set “every N steps” to a big number like 9999)

---

## How to “resume” a failed run in this simple UI
Different simple builds handle this differently, but these two tricks usually work:

**Option A — Warm start from your last save**  
If there’s an “init from / resume from / warm start” or “preload LoRA” field, point it to your **latest `*.safetensors`** from the run’s output folder, keep the same settings, and start again.

**Option B — Use the last LoRA as the base**  
If you can pick a “base model” and also a **LoRA to apply**, choose your original base model as usual *and* pick your **last saved LoRA** to load alongside. Then keep training—this effectively resumes.

If neither exists, just **rerun with the same settings** and a slightly different LoRA name (e.g., `myLora_v2`) and stop when samples look good; you can later pick the *best step* across the two runs.

---

## Reality check on your 70-image set
- With **max side 832**, **repeat=5**, **epochs=1**, you’ll land ~350 steps. That’s often enough for a clean, flexible identity LoRA (UNet-only).  
- If it’s undercooked, do a **second short run**: `repeat=3`, `epochs=1` (adds ≈210 steps) loading your previous LoRA (warm start).  

---

## About updating FluxGym
If you literally **see no “Advanced / Expert” toggle** anywhere, then yes—updating (or toggling “Advanced”) will expose batching/precision controls like gradient accumulation, bf16, xFormers/Flash-Attn, etc. Not required to proceed, but it makes life easier on 16 GB.

---

If you want, tell me **exactly** what the VRAM dropdown says in your build and I’ll translate it to “safe/fastest” for your card. Also happy to sanity-check your `Repeat`/`Epoch`/`Resize` combo before you hit Train.

**Robyn:**

I can't enter anything into the field called expected training step. which has a number (not editable) in it: 4200

**Emily:**

Totally normal—that field is **read-only**. FluxGym auto-calculates it from your dataset size × repeats × epochs.  
4200 = **70 images × 60 repeats × 1 epoch.** So your **“Repeat trains per image” is currently ~60.**

## What to change (in your Simple UI)
- **Repeat trains per image:** set to **5–8** (not 60)  
  - With 70 images:  
    - 5 repeats → **350 steps**  
    - 8 repeats → **560 steps**
- **Max train epochs:** **1** (do a short second pass later if needed)
- **Resize dataset images:** **ON** → **Max side 832** (drop to **768** if you still OOM)
- **VRAM preset:** pick the most conservative option (often “Low/Comfort/16GB”)  
  *(This usually enables mixed-precision + gradient checkpointing under the hood.)*
- **Sample image every N steps:** set **300–500** (or **9999** to effectively disable if you still OOM)

That’ll drop “Expected training steps” to ~350–560, which is a sweet spot for a 70-image identity LoRA on 16 GB.

### If you still OOM after that
- Lower **Max side** to **768** → try again.  
- If there’s a **LoRA rank/dim** field, set **16** (or **8** if memory is still tight).  
- Temporarily **disable sample images** (set N very high).

### How to continue training later
Do a second short pass (warm start): keep the same settings, set **Repeat = 3**, **Epochs = 1**, and load your **last saved LoRA** if your UI has “resume/init/warm-start” — otherwise just start a new run and stop when samples look best.

If you tell me what your **VRAM preset** choices are called in your build, I’ll point at the exact one to use.

**Robyn:**

My 'repeats trains per image' was already at 5. Dialing down max train epochs to 1 (from 6) brought the number down to 700. I don't have sample images on at all. Still got a OOM error. :(

**Emily:**

Argh, sorry you hit OOM again. On 16 GB with the **Simple** FluxGym UI, you basically have 3 levers that *actually* change VRAM:

## Do these (in order)
1) **Resize dataset images: ON → Max side = 704**  
   If it *still* OOMs, drop to **640**. (This is the biggest win.)
2) **VRAM preset:** pick the most conservative one you have (often “Low”, “16 GB”, “Comfort”, “Conservative”).  
   If you changed this before, set it to the **lowest VRAM** option again.
3) **Max train epochs = 1**, **Repeats per image = 5** (you already did this ✅).

> Splitting the dataset or lowering “expected steps” does **not** reduce VRAM per step; only **image size**, **precision**, and **sampler/attn** do — the simple UI hides the latter, so size is your hammer.

---

## If it *still* OOMs at 704
- **Set Max side = 640** and retry.  
- If your **Base model** dropdown lets you choose **Qwen** instead of Flux, try **Qwen** (it’s a bit lighter to train against in many builds).  
- Make sure absolutely nothing else is using the GPU (close browser tabs with WebGL/video, OBS, etc.).

---

## Optional: pre-shrink the PNGs once (safest)
Shrinking the files ahead of time guarantees FluxGym never tries bigger tensors. In your dataset folder, run one of these:

**Downscale only if larger than 704 px (keeps aspect):**
```bash
mogrify -path ./resized -filter Lanczos -resize '704x704>' -strip -define png:color-type=2 *.png
```

**Or hard-cap to 640 px:**
```bash
mogrify -path ./resized -filter Lanczos -resize '640x640>' -strip -define png:color-type=2 *.png
```
Then point FluxGym at `./resized`. (This doesn’t change captions or filenames other than the path.)

> Tip: cropping to **head/shoulders** on the few *largest* images also helps. Flux/Qwen learn identity fine without huge torso/background areas.

---

## How to continue training later (simple UI)
- If you see **“init/warm start / resume from LoRA”**: choose your **latest saved `.safetensors`** and run another short pass (e.g., Repeats = 3, Epochs = 1).  
- If there’s no resume field, just re-run with the same settings; you can pick the best checkpoint from either run.

---

## Quick sanity for your current run
- Keep **sample images OFF** (you already have them off).  
- If there’s a **LoRA rank/dim** field anywhere, set **16**; if still OOM → **8**.  
- Don’t touch the dataset size again once it works—consistency helps.

If you tell me what your **VRAM preset** options are called (exact wording) and whether your **Base model** can be switched to Qwen in that dropdown, I’ll give you the precise combo to pick and a target “Max side” that should fit first try.

**Robyn:**

The images are aleady at 512px - in the dataset folder, which FluxGym did for me (as well as generating all the little text files) before it crashed. I wish FluxGym in Gradio had a way of reloading a workflow that failed.

**Emily:**

Got it, Robyn — if you’re OOM’ing even with **512-px** images, it’s almost certainly the *trainer’s internal settings* (precision/attention/batch) hidden by your “Simple” FluxGym UI. Here’s the most reliable way to get a run through on a **4060 Ti 16 GB** with only the controls you *do* have.

## Do this exact combo in your Simple UI
**Step 1 — LoRA info**
- **VRAM preset:** pick the *most conservative* option you see (e.g., **Low**, **Comfort**, **16 GB**, **Safe**, **Minimal**).  
  - If there’s also an **“Ultra-low”** or **“8 GB”** option, try that instead — paradoxically, it often enables the safest memory plan.
- **Repeat trains per image:** **3** (just for the first pass).  
  - With 70 images → ~210 steps; we’ll do a short second pass later.
- **Max train epochs:** **1**.  
- **Expected training steps:** ignore (read-only).  
- **Sample images:** **OFF** (you already have them off).  
- **Resize dataset images:** **ON**, set **Max side = 512** (you’re already there, leave it).

**Base model:** If the dropdown lets you pick, choose **Qwen** (tends to be a touch lighter to train than Flux in many builds). If not available, leave as is.

**Anything mentioning text encoder / TEnc / TE:** **OFF** (UNet-only LoRA), if it exists anywhere.

**LoRA rank/dim** (if you can see it anywhere): set **8** (alpha 8). If you don’t see a rank field, ignore.

Now try training.

---

## If it still OOMs
Make just one change at a time:
1) **VRAM preset → the one *below* what you chose** (e.g., from “16 GB/Comfort” down to “Low/8 GB/Ultra-low”).  
2) **Max side = 448** (yes, you can train at 448 — identity survives fine).  
3) **Repeat = 2** (first pass), **Epochs = 1**.

> Reducing repeats/epochs won’t affect VRAM per step, but it *does* get you to a checkpoint faster so you can “warm start” a second pass with safer settings.

---

## How to continue after a crash (warm-start) in the Simple UI
Different builds name this differently. Look for any of these and use whichever you have:

- **“Resume from checkpoint / Init from / Warm-start / Load LoRA”**:  
  pick your **last saved `.safetensors`** from the previous run’s output folder, keep the same dataset, and start again (e.g., Repeat=3, Epochs=1).

- **“Apply LoRA with base model”** flow:  
  if there’s a place to select a LoRA alongside your base model, pick your **last saved LoRA** there, then start a new short run. This effectively resumes.

If there’s no explicit resume anywhere, just rerun the same settings with a *new* LoRA name (e.g., `_v2`) and keep the best checkpoint across runs.

---

## Why this is happening (so it’s less maddening)
- The Simple UI hides precision/attention/batch toggles. Some presets pick memory-heavier attention or try to train the text encoder. Picking the **lowest VRAM** preset is how you force a safer path without the advanced panel.
- 512-px images are good, but VRAM spikes mostly come from **attention implementation** and **text-encoder training** — not repeats/epochs.

---

## Tiny extras that help
- Close all GPU-using apps (video players, WebGL-heavy browser tabs).  
- In the same session, don’t open image viewers that render on the GPU.  
- If there’s a **“workers / dataloader workers”** field anywhere, set **2**.

---

### Want me to point at the exact **VRAM preset** to pick?
Paste the exact labels you see in that dropdown (e.g., “Comfort / Balanced / Low / Tiny / 8 GB / 16 GB”), and I’ll tell you the safest one for the 4060 Ti. If your Simple UI has *any* toggles beyond Step 1, list them and I’ll map them 1:1 to memory-safe values.

**Robyn:**

Okay, last thing first: VRAM preset. The options are radio buttons:  
o 20G  
o 16G  
o 12G

Just selected 12 G, 1 epoch, 3 repeat trains... crashed. There is an advanced options toggle with what looks like all sorts of switches to add to the train command (prefixed with '--')...

**Emily:**

Great—switching to the **Advanced options** is the right move. On a 4060 Ti 16 GB, you’ll stop the OOMs by forcing a lean config via flags. Below are two ready-to-paste presets you can drop into the Advanced box (those `--` switches). Try the **Ultra-lean** first.

---

## Ultra-lean (should fit even when 12G preset crashes)
Paste this whole line into the Advanced options field:
```
--batch_size 1 --grad_accum 4 --mixed_precision bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --attention xformers --train_text_encoder false --unet_only --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
**What it does (briefly):**
- 1× batch + grad accumulation = tiny VRAM use with “effective” batch 4  
- bf16 + grad checkpointing + xFormers = big memory savings  
- UNet-only LoRA (text encoder frozen)  
- Low-rank LoRA (r=8) trims optimizer/state size  
- 8-bit AdamW, latents cached, VAE fp16, few workers, EMA off

If you still OOM, add **one** more flag: `--offload_optimizer cpu`

---

## Lean (a bit higher quality, still safe)
When Ultra-lean works, you can step up to:
```
--batch_size 1 --grad_accum 4 --mixed_precision bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --attention flash2 --train_text_encoder false --unet_only --lora_rank 16 --lora_alpha 16 --lora_dropout 0.06 --optimizer adamw8bit --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
(Exactly the same, but **flash-attn2** and **rank 16**.)

> If `--attention flash2` errors on your build, switch back to `--attention xformers`.

---

## Keep your “Simple” page like this
- **VRAM preset:** 12 G (radio button) is fine; Advanced flags will override the risky bits.
- **Repeat trains per image:** 3 (first pass)  
- **Max train epochs:** 1  
- **Resize dataset images:** ON (you already have 512px; leave it)

---

## How to resume a failed run in this UI
Look in the UI for any of these fields; use whichever you have:

- `--resume_from /path/to/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors`  
- `--init_lora /path/to/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors`  
- `--warm_start /path/to/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors`

If you see an **“Extra args”** or **Advanced** text field, you can add the resume flag there. The checkpoint to use is usually the latest file in your output folder (highest step number).

If there’s no resume flag available, a practical workaround:
1) Set a **new LoRA name** (e.g., `MyLora_v2`),  
2) Keep the same Advanced flags,  
3) Run another short pass (Repeat=3, Epochs=1),  
4) Later pick the best checkpoint across both runs.

---

## If it *still* OOMs after Ultra-lean
Change just one thing at a time:
- Add `--offload_optimizer cpu` (if not already), **or**
- Drop rank further: `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`, **or**
- Reduce workers: `--num_workers 1`

(These three together almost always fit on 16 GB.)

---

## Nice-to-have sanity checks
- Make sure **no text-encoder flags** are left on elsewhere.  
- Close GPU-hungry apps (video players, WebGL tabs).  
- If there’s a field for **save frequency**, keep it moderate (e.g., every 400–600 steps) to reduce overhead.

If you paste back the **exact Advanced options** label names your build shows (sometimes they differ slightly), I’ll translate them 1:1 to the safest values for your UI.

**Robyn:**

Is 'vae_batch_size' the same as 'batch_size'? It's the only switch I see that contains 'batch_size', Emily. By thw way, these switches - there's HEAPS of them!! - seem to be organised alphabetically...

**Emily:**

Great question — **no**, `--vae_batch_size` is **not** the same as `--batch_size`.

- `--batch_size` (sometimes called `--train_batch_size`, `--per_device_train_batch_size`, or `--micro_batch_size`) = how many **training samples** you process in one forward/backward step. This is the one that blows up VRAM.
- `--vae_batch_size` = how many **images the VAE encodes/decodes at once** (for caching latents or making samples). It affects RAM/VRAM a bit, but it’s separate from the training micro-batch.

So: keep `vae_batch_size` **low (1–2)**, but the **real** OOM fix comes from the training batch + precision + attention flags.

---

## What to set in your alphabetized “heaps of switches”
Skim to these names (they’ll be near each other alphabetically). Use **only the variant that exists** in your UI.

### Core memory savers
- `--batch_size 1` **or** `--train_batch_size 1` **or** `--per_device_train_batch_size 1` **or** `--micro_batch_size 1`
- `--grad_accum 4` **or** `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- `--mixed_precision bf16`  *(fallback: `fp16`)*
- `--gradient_checkpointing`
- `--attention xformers`  *(fallback: `--attention flash2` if your build supports it; if flash errors, stick to xformers)*
- `--unet_only`  *(or)* `--train_text_encoder false` *(or)* `--freeze_text_encoder` *(any one of these to avoid training TE)*

### LoRA shape/optimizer
- `--lora_rank 8`  *(try 16 later when stable)*
- `--lora_alpha 8`
- `--lora_dropout 0.08`
- `--optimizer adamw8bit`
- `--weight_decay 0.01` *(if present)*
- `--learning_rate 1e-4` *(or `--lr_unet 1e-4`)*

### VAE / data loader
- `--cache_latents`
- `--vae_fp16`
- `--vae_batch_size 1` *(your question—set to 1 or 2)*
- `--num_workers 2`  *(or `--dataloader_num_workers 2`)*

### Housekeeping
- `--ema false`
- `--save_every 500` *(or whatever that flag is called in your build)*
- **Resume/warm start** (pick whichever exists):
  - `--resume_from /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors`
  - `--init_lora /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors`
  - `--warm_start /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors`

### If still OOM
- `--offload_optimizer cpu`
- drop LoRA rank further: `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`
- `--num_workers 1`

---

## Copy-paste minimal profiles (use whichever your UI accepts)

### Ultra-lean (most likely to fit first try)
```
--batch_size 1 --grad_accum 4 --mixed_precision bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --attention xformers --unet_only --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
*(If your UI doesn’t have `--batch_size`, replace it with one of: `--train_batch_size 1` or `--per_device_train_batch_size 1` or `--micro_batch_size 1`.)*

### Lean (after Ultra-lean succeeds)
```
--batch_size 1 --grad_accum 4 --mixed_precision bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --attention flash2 --unet_only --lora_rank 16 --lora_alpha 16 --lora_dropout 0.06 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
*(If `flash2` errors, switch back to `xformers`.)*

---

## Quick run recipe for your current project
1) Keep your **Simple** section as you have it (VRAM: **12G**, **1 epoch**, **3 repeats**, images already **512 px**).
2) Open **Advanced**, paste the **Ultra-lean** line.
3) Train. If it still OOMs, add: `--offload_optimizer cpu`.
4) Once you get a checkpoint, you can “resume” a short second pass using one of the resume flags above.

If you want, paste a screenshot (or the text) of your Advanced flags list around the “b”/“g”/“l” sections, and I’ll point to the exact spellings your build uses for these switches.

**Robyn:**

Okay, found '--train_batch_size'...

**Emily:**

Perfect—that’s the big one. Set:

- `--train_batch_size 1`

Then add the rest of this **Ultra-lean** pack (copy/paste as one line in Advanced). I’m using the most common flag names you’re likely to have:

```
--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --mixed_precision bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --attention xformers --unet_only --train_text_encoder false --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```

If it **still OOMs**, add this one more switch:
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
```

## If your UI uses slightly different flag names
Use whichever you see:
- batch: `--train_batch_size` (you found it) *(or)* `--per_device_train_batch_size` *(or)* `--micro_batch_size`
- accum: `--gradient_accumulation_steps` *(or)* `--grad_accum`
- attention: `--attention xformers` *(or, if available later)* `--attention flash2`
- freeze text encoder: `--train_text_encoder false` *(or)* `--freeze_text_encoder` *(or just rely on* `--unet_only`*)

## Your “Simple” page can stay as-is
- VRAM preset: **12G**
- Repeats: **3**
- Epochs: **1**
- Images already 512 px ✔
- Samples off ✔

## After it runs once (optional step-up)
When stable, you can bump quality a touch:
```
--lora_rank 16 --lora_alpha 16 --lora_dropout 0.06 --attention flash2
```
(If `flash2` errors, keep `xformers`.)

## Resuming later (if you see one of these)
Add one of:
```
--resume_from /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--init_lora /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--warm_start /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
```

## Quick sanity while training
- Watch `nvidia-smi`: with these flags, VRAM should plateau well under 16 GB.
- If a crash happens during the very first step, it’s almost always batch/attention; keep `xformers`, keep batch 1, keep bf16.

Paste back any flags your UI doesn’t recognize (or the exact wording it expects), and I’ll swap in the correct spellings.

**Robyn:**

There's no '--mixed_precision'... but there is a '--full_bf16' tickbox.

**Emily:**

Great—`--full_bf16` is your mixed-precision switch in this build. Turn it **ON** (tickbox). Then use the flags below (no `--mixed_precision` needed).

## What to tick / set in Advanced
- ✅ **Full BF16:** `--full_bf16` (tickbox)
- ✅ **Gradient checkpointing:** `--gradient_checkpointing`
- ✅ **UNet-only:** `--unet_only`
- ✅ **Freeze text encoder:** `--train_text_encoder false` (or a checkbox named “freeze/disable text-encoder”)
- ✅ **xFormers attention:** `--attention xformers`  *(use this unless you *know* you have flash-attn2 working)*
- ✅ **Cache latents:** `--cache_latents`
- ✅ **VAE fp16:** `--vae_fp16`
- ◽ **Train batch size:** `--train_batch_size 1`
- ◽ **Grad accumulation:** `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- ◽ **LoRA:** `--lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08`
- ◽ **Optimizer:** `--optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --weight_decay 0.01` *(if weight_decay exists)*
- ◽ **Loader:** `--num_workers 2 --vae_batch_size 1`
- ◽ **Disable EMA:** `--ema false`

### Copy-paste line (fits 16 GB on your setup)
```
--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --gradient_checkpointing --attention xformers --unet_only --train_text_encoder false --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
…and **tick** the separate **Full BF16** checkbox.

### If it still OOMs
Add one (in this order):
- `--offload_optimizer cpu`
- Lower LoRA rank: `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`
- `--num_workers 1`

### After it runs once (optional quality bump)
- Raise rank: `--lora_rank 16 --lora_alpha 16`
- If you later install flash-attn2 correctly: switch to `--attention flash2` (keeps VRAM similar, sometimes a touch faster).

### Resuming later
Use whichever exists in your build:
```
--resume_from /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--init_lora /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--warm_start /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
```

You’re very close—flip **Full BF16 on**, paste that line, and it should fit your 4060 Ti 16 GB.

**Robyn:**

Would '--gradient_checkpointing' come under a different name?

**Emily:**

Great eye—different builds name it differently. Here are the most common aliases you might see in FluxGym-style trainers (sorted roughly how they’d appear in an alphabetical list):

### Likely names for gradient checkpointing
- `--gradient_checkpointing`  ← most common (Diffusers/Kohya style)
- `--gradient-checkpointing`  (hyphen instead of underscore)
- `--gradient_checkpoint`     (shortened)
- `--grad_checkpointing`
- `--grad_checkpoint`
- `--use_gradient_checkpointing`
- `--enable_gradient_checkpointing`
- `--checkpointing`           (rare, but some UIs shorten it)
- GUI checkbox labeled: **“Use gradient checkpointing”**, **“Enable gradient checkpointing”**, or simply **“Gradient checkpointing”**

### How to find it fast in your alphabetized list
- Jump to the **c** or **g** sections and scan for: `checkpoint…`, `gradient…`, `grad…`
- If there’s a search field, type **check** or **grad**.

### How to confirm it actually turned on
When you start training, the console usually prints something like:
- `Gradient checkpointing: enabled`  
- or `Enabling gradient checkpointing` / `Using gradient checkpointing`  
(If you don’t see it, assume it’s **off**.)

### If you truly can’t find it
You can still fit 16 GB by leaning on the other savers you already have:
- `--train_batch_size 1`
- `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- `--full_bf16` (tickbox)
- `--attention xformers`
- `--unet_only` and `--train_text_encoder false`
- `--lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8`
- `--optimizer adamw8bit`
- `--cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1`
- If needed: `--offload_optimizer cpu` and/or `--num_workers 1`

If you want, paste a screenshot (or list) of the “g…” and “c…” flags you see, and I’ll point to the exact one in your build.

**Robyn:**

In the 3rd field (under Start Training) there's a listing of the script which includes 

--gradient_checkpointing\

but in the advanced options, when I search for 'gradient', I get 

'ddp_gradient_as_bucket_view' (not ticked)
'--gradient_accumulation_steps' (set at 4)

and then options for fp16 and bf16 that include the word 'gradient'. Oh, and '--scale_weight_norms'.

**Emily:**

Nice—if the generated **training script preview** already shows:

```
--gradient_checkpointing \
```

…then checkpointing **is enabled** (the trailing “\” is just a line-wrap). You don’t need to add it again in Advanced.

A few notes on the other things you found:

- `ddp_gradient_as_bucket_view` → for multi-GPU/DDP; **leave unticked** on a single 4060 Ti.
- `--scale_weight_norms` → unrelated to memory; you can ignore it.
- The fp16/bf16 items that mention “gradient” are about **loss scaling**; you already have `--full_bf16` (good).

## What to do now (exact settings)
Keep your Simple page as you have it (12G preset, 1 epoch, repeats=3, 512px images). Then in **Advanced**:

1) Tick: **Full BF16**
2) Make sure there’s a checkbox or flag to **freeze text encoder**. If not obvious, add the flag explicitly:
   - `--train_text_encoder false`
3) Use **xFormers** attention:
   - `--attention xformers`
4) Set **true batch 1** and **grad accumulation 4**:
   - `--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
5) UNet-only LoRA:
   - `--unet_only`
6) LoRA shape + optimizer + loader:
   ```
   --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 \
   --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 \
   --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 \
   --ema false
   ```
7) (Only if you still OOM): add
   - `--offload_optimizer cpu`

### One-line to paste (don’t include gradient_checkpointing since it’s already in the preview)
```
--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --attention xformers --unet_only --train_text_encoder false --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --ema false
```
*(Then tick the separate **Full BF16** box.)*

## Sanity checks at launch
Watch the console/log right after you hit Start:
- Should print something like: `Gradient checkpointing: enabled`
- `Using xformers attention`
- `bf16`/`bfloat16` dtype
- `train_batch_size = 1`, `gradient_accumulation_steps = 4`
- `Training text encoder: False` (or similar)

If you still see OOM immediately:
- Add `--offload_optimizer cpu`
- Drop to `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`
- Set `--num_workers 1`

If OOM happens *after a few steps*, it’s almost always optimizer/state size → the `--offload_optimizer cpu` and lower LoRA rank fixes it.

If you want, paste the full “script preview” block (just the header lines with flags), and I’ll sanity-check that nothing sneaky (like text-encoder training) is still on.

**Robyn:**

The only thing for 'text_encoder' is '--text_encoder_lr'... which is learn rate, I think. No toggle for 
'--train_text_encoder'. How do I add a flag?  There's a 'training Field Comment' where you can enter an arbitrary comment string (stored in metadata).

**Emily:**

You’ve got two easy ways to make sure the text encoder doesn’t train:

## A) Use a pass-through flag in Advanced (preferred)
If your UI has an **Advanced options** text box (where you pasted other `--` flags), you can add flags even if they’re not listed in the toggle list. Paste these (keep the ones you already have):

```
--unet_only --train_text_encoder false --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --attention xformers --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 2 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --ema false
```

If your trainer doesn’t recognize `--train_text_encoder`, try one of these aliases (only add one at a time):
- `--freeze_text_encoder`
- `--no_text_encoder_training`
- `--te_train false`
- `--tenc_train false`

## B) If the flag name truly isn’t supported
Just **set its LR to zero** (this hard-freezes it):

```
--text_encoder_lr 0
```

If you see multiple TE LRs (common with SDXL/Qwen), also set:
```
--text_encoder_lr1 0 --text_encoder_lr2 0
```

And keep `--unet_only` in your flags so only the UNet LoRA is built.

---

## How to add the flag
Type/paste it into the **Advanced options** text area (the free-form field you’re already using). Anything you put there gets appended to the training command even if there’s no checkbox for it.

---

## Quick sanity check before launch
Look at the “script preview” block:
- You should see either `--unet_only` **and** `--train_text_encoder false` **or** `--text_encoder_lr 0` (and `lr1/2 0` if present).
- Also confirm: `--train_batch_size 1`, `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`, your attention choice (`xformers`), and `--full_bf16` (if it’s a separate checkbox).

If OOM persists after freezing TE:
- Add `--offload_optimizer cpu`
- Lower rank to `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`
- Set `--num_workers 1`

If you want, paste the top 10–20 lines of your script preview and I’ll spot anything that might still be turning the TE on.

**Robyn:**

Ah-HA! Didn't realise it until just now, but it _looks_ like the Train script is an editable field! And, so is the Train config! Here's my Train script:

```

**Emily:**

Nice catch—that’s the golden door. Since the Train script/config are editable, you can force a super-lean run that fits your 4060 Ti 16 GB.

Below is a **safe minimal script** you can adapt. Edit your Train script so it contains these key args (keep your paths/dataset/model the same):

```
--train_batch_size 1 \
--gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
--full_bf16 \
--gradient_checkpointing \
--attention xformers \
--unet_only \
--train_text_encoder false \
--text_encoder_lr 0 \
--lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 \
--optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --weight_decay 0.01 \
--cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 \
--num_workers 2 \
--ema false
```

If you still OOM, add:
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
```
(And as a last resort: `--lora_rank 4 --lora_alpha 4`, or `--num_workers 1`.)

### What to change in your existing script (quick find/replace)
Search your script for these and set the values:

- `train_batch_size` → `1`
- `gradient_accumulation_steps` (or `grad_accum`) → `4`
- `full_bf16` → present (or keep the checkbox on)
- `gradient_checkpointing` → present
- `attention` → `xformers`  (if you know flash-attn2 works, you can use `flash2` later)
- `unet_only` → present
- If you **can’t** add `--train_text_encoder false`, then set:
  - `text_encoder_lr` → `0` (and `text_encoder_lr1/2` → `0` if they exist)
- `lora_rank`/`lora_alpha` → `8` / `8`
- `optimizer` → `adamw8bit`
- `learning_rate` (or `lr_unet`) → `1e-4`
- `cache_latents` → present
- `vae_fp16` → present
- `vae_batch_size` → `1`
- `num_workers` (or `dataloader_num_workers`) → `2`
- `ema` → `false`

### Resume later (add one of these if supported)
```
--resume_from /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--init_lora /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
--warm_start /path/to/last_checkpoint.safetensors
```

### Sanity on the Simple panel
- Keep **VRAM preset: 12 G** (flags override the risky bits).
- **Epochs = 1**, **Repeats = 3**.
- Images already **512 px** ✔
- Samples off ✔

If you want, paste the **first ~30 lines of your Train script** here and I’ll mark exactly what to tweak in place.

**Emily:**

Awesome—thanks for pasting the script. You’ve got a few flags in there that *increase* VRAM or duplicate work. Here’s a drop-in **leaner** version that should fit your 4060 Ti 16 GB, keeping everything else the same.

## What to change (exact edits)

**Remove these (VRAM heavy / redundant):**
- `--highvram`  ← forces a fatter memory plan
- `--sdpa`      ← keep xFormers instead (lighter)
- `--fp8_base`  ← not needed; can cause extra casts/allocs
- one of the **bf16** flags (you have both `--mixed_precision bf16` and `--full_bf16`; keep just **`--full_bf16`**)
- optional: `--persistent_data_loader_workers` (can hold extra RAM/VRAM)

**Tighten batch/loader:**
- Keep `--train_batch_size 1`
- Keep `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- Change `--max_data_loader_n_workers 2` → **`1`** (a touch safer)

**Freeze the text encoder (if your build supports it):**
- Add `--train_text_encoder false`  
  If the script errors on that flag, remove it and instead **set the TE LR to zero**, which you already can:
  - `--text_encoder_lr 0`

**Add a couple of safe memory savers (supported by sd-scripts):**
- `--vae_batch_size 1`
- (optional if still tight) `--offload_optimizer device` or `--offload_optimizer cpu` (only if your build supports it; try device first)

**Quality/stability nudge:**
- `--network_dim 4` is *very* small. It’s OK for a first run, but once this fits, bump to **8** (alpha 8) without a big VRAM hit.
- Your LR `8e-4` is quite high for LoRA; use **`1e-4`** for safer convergence.

**Epochs:** they don’t affect peak VRAM, but 16 epochs is overkill. Set **`--max_train_epochs 1`** here and do short warm-starts later.

---

## Revised script (copy/paste)

```bash
accelerate launch \
  --mixed_precision bf16 \
  --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 \
  sd-scripts/flux_train_network.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/unet/flux1-dev.sft" \
  --clip_l "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/clip_l.safetensors" \

  --save_model_as safetensors \
  --max_data_loader_n_workers 1 \

  --gradient_checkpointing \
  --save_precision bf16 \
  --network_module networks.lora_flux \
  --network_dim 4 \
  --optimizer_type adamw8bit \
  --learning_rate 1e-4 \
  --cache_text_encoder_outputs \
  --cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk \
  --max_train_epochs 1 \
  --save_every_n_epochs 1 \
  --dataset_config "/home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs/dataset.toml" \
  --output_dir "/home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs" \
  --output_name  \
  --timestep_sampling shift \
  --discrete_flow_shift 3.1582 \
  --model_prediction_type raw \
  --guidance_scale 1 \
  --loss_type l2 \
  --full_bf16 \
  --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
  --train_batch_size 1 \
  --xformers \
  --vae_batch_size 1 \
  --text_encoder_lr 0
```

**Removed:** `--highvram`, `--sdpa`, `--fp8_base`, the duplicate `--mixed_precision bf16` (kept `--full_bf16`), and `--persistent_data_loader_workers`.  
**Changed:** `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`, LR to `1e-4`, epochs to `1`.  
**Added:** `--vae_batch_size 1`, `--text_encoder_lr 0`.

> If it *still* OOMs, append **one** of these at the end (in this order):  
> `--offload_optimizer device`  → if not recognized, try `--offload_optimizer cpu`.

---

## After it runs once
- If VRAM is comfy, bump `--network_dim` to **8** (and **`--learning_rate 1e-4`** still fine).
- If you want more steps, increase **epochs** or use repeats in the UI; peak VRAM won’t change.

## Resuming
If your build supports it, add one of:
```
--resume /home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors
--resume_from /home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors
--init_lora /home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs/your_last_checkpoint.safetensors
```
Use whichever flag your script accepts (it will error if it doesn’t recognize one).

---

If you prefer, paste back the **first 10–15 lines of the log** after launch (the part that lists settings/providers). I’ll sanity-check that BF16, xFormers, batch=1, grad_accum=4, and TE LR=0 actually took effect.

**Robyn:**

Is there something I need to toggle off in Advanced Options? When I copy/pasted over what was there with the fixed script, it insisted on reading from the entries in Advanced Options...

**Emily:**

Yep—that’s exactly what’s happening. In this FluxGym build the **final command is assembled as:**

> **Base script** (what you edited) **+** **Advanced options** (checkboxes + flags)

…and **Advanced is appended last**, so it **overrides** anything you set earlier in the script. That’s why your changes “don’t stick.”

You’ve got two clean ways to fix it—pick one:

---

## Option A (fastest): Drive everything from **Advanced**, keep the script minimal

1) In **Train script**, keep only the essentials (paths + dataset + seeds), and **remove** memory/LoRA/precision flags.
2) In **Advanced**, paste the lean flags you want.
3) Train. (Advanced wins, so no conflicts.)

**Minimal script example (edit only the paths):**
```bash
accelerate launch \
  --num_cpu_threads_per_process 1 \
  sd-scripts/flux_train_network.py \
  --pretrained_model_name_or_path "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/unet/flux1-dev.sft" \
  --clip_l "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/clip_l.safetensors" \
  --t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xxl_fp16.safetensors" \
  --ae "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/vae/ae.sft" \
  --dataset_config "/home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs/dataset.toml" \
  --output_dir "/home/robyn/fluxgym/outputs" \
  --output_name "" \
  --seed 42 \
  --save_model_as safetensors \
  --save_precision bf16 \
  --cache_latents_to_disk
```

**Advanced → paste this (and tick Full BF16 if it’s a checkbox):**
```
--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --gradient_checkpointing --attention xformers --unet_only --text_encoder_lr 0 --lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 --cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 1 --ema false
```
If it still OOMs, append: `--offload_optimizer cpu`

Also **turn OFF**/clear any Advanced items you don’t want auto-added (un-tick **sdpa**, **highvram**, **fp8_base**, **persistent_data_loader_workers**, etc.).

---

## Option B: Drive everything from the **script**, make **Advanced empty**

1) **Clear** the Advanced options text box completely and **untick** all checkboxes there (so it appends nothing).
2) Use the **revised lean script** you pasted earlier (the one I gave you), and train.

If there’s no way to fully clear/untick Advanced (some builds auto-restore defaults), prefer **Option A**.

---

### Quick checklist (what to disable in Advanced)
- ⛔ `--sdpa`
- ⛔ `--highvram`
- ⛔ `--fp8_base`
- ⛔ `--persistent_data_loader_workers`
- ⛔ any **fp16** precision toggles (we’re using **Full BF16**)
- Keep **xFormers**, **gradient checkpointing**, **batch 1**, **accum 4**, **text_encoder_lr 0**, **LoRA r=8**, **adamw8bit**, **vae_fp16**, **vae_batch_size 1**, **num_workers 1**, **ema false**.

### Sanity check in the “script preview”
Right before you start, scan the assembled command:
- You should see **only one** attention choice (**xformers**, not sdpa),
- **No** `--highvram`, **no** `--fp8_base`,
- `--train_batch_size 1`, `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`,
- `--gradient_checkpointing`,
- BF16 present (either `--full_bf16` or `--save_precision bf16`),
- `--text_encoder_lr 0` (or `--train_text_encoder false` if supported).

If anything unwanted still appears, it’s coming from Advanced—clear/toggle it there.

You should be good after this. If the run still OOMs on step 0, add `--offload_optimizer cpu`; if it OOMs after a few steps, drop `--lora_rank 8 → 4` and keep going.

**Robyn:**

Well, this is a bit crazy. I got onto the developer's GitHub page, searched through issues, and sure enough, someone else had the same problem. The developer suggested creating a copy of 'app.py' (save the original) and change the script settings in the python file. Which, I did. And it seems to be working, so far. Okay, let's have another go!

**Emily:**

Yesss! 🎉 Nice sleuthing, Robyn. If it’s training now after editing `app.py`, you’re on the right track. Here’s a tight game plan so this run finishes cleanly—and a few guardrails so future updates don’t undo your fix.

## Quick run checklist (while it’s going)
- **Watch VRAM**: run `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` in another terminal. With batch=1, accum=4, xFormers, bf16, you should sit well under 16 GB after the first couple of steps.
- **Confirm the assembled command** (the console prints it): verify it doesn’t re-add `--sdpa`, `--highvram`, or `--fp8_base`. If those creep back in, they’ll spike memory.
- **Text encoder frozen**: ensure either `--train_text_encoder false` shows, or `--text_encoder_lr 0` is present. Either will freeze it.
- **Save frequency**: keep saves reasonable (e.g., every **1 epoch** or every **400–600 steps**) so you have a checkpoint to resume from if anything hiccups.

## If you hit a wobble mid-run
- OOM **at step 0** → add `--offload_optimizer cpu` (or `device` if supported), and/or set `--num_workers 1`.
- OOM **after a few steps** → lower LoRA size: `--network_dim 4` (you already have 4), or keep 4 and carry on; later warm-start a second pass at dim **8** once stable.

## Evaluating without VRAM spikes
- Keep “sample every N steps” **disabled** (or set a big N).  
- After the run, test the LoRA at inference with 2–3 of your **micro-feminise** prompt sets. If identity is solid but a tad soft, warm-start a short second pass (same flags) with:
  - `--network_dim 8 --lora_alpha 8`
  - One more **epoch** (or a few hundred steps via repeats)

## Make your `app.py` edit future-proof
- **Save a copy** of your modified file (you did—great).  
- Also save a tiny **diff** so you can re-apply it after updates:
  ```bash
  diff -u app.py app.patched.py > app.patch
  # later after pulling updates:
  patch app.py < app.patch
  ```
- If the project adds a proper “Advanced defaults” section later, you can move those flags back out of code and into the UI.

## Healthy training targets for this LoRA
- With **70 images (512px)** and your lean config:
  - First pass: **~200–600 steps** is often enough for a flexible identity LoRA (UNet-only).
  - If undercooked: warm-start + **dim 8** and do another **~200–400** steps.
- Don’t chase maximum steps—pick the **lowest checkpoint** that nails identity without overfitting quirks.

## Tiny “next-knobs” once it’s stable
- Try `--network_dim 8` (alpha 8) before raising resolution—dim bumps cost almost no VRAM.
- If you later install flash-attn2 correctly, you can swap `--attention xformers` → `--attention flash2` for speed (same memory ballpark).

If you want, paste the first dozen log lines (the part listing dtype, attention, batch, accum), and I’ll sanity-check that all the memory-saving switches actually took effect. Otherwise—go, go, go! 🚀

**Robyn:**

Oops, got a python error: '--train_text_encoder false'. Should I set it to 0?

**Emily:**

Good catch. In **sd-scripts/flux_train_network.py**, `--train_text_encoder` is a **boolean flag** (enable-once). It’s **off by default**. Passing a value like `false` makes the arg parser choke.

### Do this
- **Remove** `--train_text_encoder false` entirely.  
- **Keep** `--text_encoder_lr 0` (this hard-freezes any TE optimizers if they’d otherwise be created).

If your build exposes separate TE LRs, also zero them (only if they exist in your script/help):
```
--text_encoder_lr 0
--clip_lr 0         # sometimes used for CLIP-L
--t5xxl_lr 0        # sometimes used for T5XXL
```

### Minimal safe tail (no TE training)
Keep the rest of your lean flags and make sure these are present:
```
--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --gradient_checkpointing \
--attention xformers --full_bf16 --optimizer adamw8bit --learning_rate 1e-4 \
--lora_rank 8 --lora_alpha 8 --lora_dropout 0.08 \
--cache_latents --vae_fp16 --vae_batch_size 1 --num_workers 1 --ema false \
--text_encoder_lr 0
```
If memory is still tight, append:
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
```

You should be good after just deleting `--train_text_encoder false`.

**Robyn:**

**Emily:**

Ah—`SIGKILL (9)` with no Python traceback almost always means **the OS OOM-killer terminated the process** (usually due to **system RAM** blowing up, not VRAM). The timing—right after loading **T5-XXL**—fits: T5-XXL is huge, and your script is also **caching text-encoder outputs**, which can spike RAM.

Here’s how to get past it, step-by-step.

## 1) Remove the RAM hogs (edit your train script)
Delete these two flags (they often balloon host RAM during the “prepare dataset” phase):
```
--cache_text_encoder_outputs
--cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk
```
They’re optional; you can train fine without them.

Also, you can safely remove:
```
--persistent_data_loader_workers
```
(it can keep worker state resident).

Keep:
```
--max_data_loader_n_workers 1
```

## 2) Freeze (don’t train) the text encoder
You already tried `--train_text_encoder false` (not supported in your build). So keep this instead:
```
--text_encoder_lr 0
```
(That hard-freezes TE training.)

## 3) Optional RAM savers if it still gets killed
Add one (or both) of these if your build accepts them:
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
--num_cpu_threads_per_process 1
```
(You already had `--num_cpu_threads_per_process 1`, good.)

If your script/help mentions any of these, they help too (add only if present in `--help`):
```
--t5xxl_device cpu
--clip_l_device cpu
--text_encoder_device cpu
```
(They keep the giant T5/CLIP on CPU. Training still works since you’re not training TE, but it’s slower—fine for stability.)

## 4) Sanity: keep the lean GPU settings you had
- `--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- `--full_bf16` (you can drop the duplicate `--mixed_precision bf16` if you like—`--full_bf16` is enough)
- `--gradient_checkpointing`
- `--xformers`
- `--network_dim 8` (ok), `--optimizer_type adamw8bit`, `--learning_rate 1e-4`
- `--vae_batch_size 1`, `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`
- **Do not** add back `--sdpa`, `--highvram`, or `--fp8_base`

## 5) Quick check it *was* the OOM-killer
In a terminal:
```bash
dmesg | tail -n 50
```
If you see a line like `Out of memory: Killed process ... python3 ...`, that confirms it.

## 6) (Optional) Give the OS more headroom
If your system swap is tiny/none, adding a 16–32 GB swapfile prevents abrupt SIGKILLs during big allocations (especially when T5-XXL maps).

---

### Drop-in revision of your command (diff)
Remove:
```
--cache_text_encoder_outputs
--cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk
--persistent_data_loader_workers
```
Keep (or add if missing):
```
--text_encoder_lr 0
--max_data_loader_n_workers 1
--vae_batch_size 1
--offload_optimizer cpu   # only if needed
```

Everything else can stay as in your last run.

Try that and start again—you should pass the text-encoder loading/caching phase and actually enter training. If you get another kill, paste the newest script block (and the last 20 log lines) and I’ll tighten it one more notch.

**Robyn:**

Yep, it was python that killed it, Emily.

**Emily:**

Got it—that “python died with SIGKILL (9)” is your **Linux OOM-killer** taking the process out. It’s almost always **system RAM** (not VRAM), and it happens right after **T5-XXL** loads and the trainer tries to cache TE outputs.

Here’s a tight fix plan that works in practice on 16 GB VRAM + moderate system RAM:

## Do these edits (lowest risk first)

1) **Remove TE caching (RAM hog)**
   - Delete both flags from your script:
     ```
     --cache_text_encoder_outputs
     --cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk
     ```
   - Keep the freeze:
     ```
     --text_encoder_lr 0
     ```

2) **Keep workers tiny**
   - You already set:
     ```
     --max_data_loader_n_workers 1
     ```
   - Good—leave it at 1.

3) **(If still killed) Offload optimizer**
   - Append:
     ```
     --offload_optimizer cpu
     ```

4) **(If still killed) Park TE on CPU**  
   Only if your build supports these (try in this order—if one errors, remove it and try the next):
   ```
   --t5xxl_device cpu
   --clip_l_device cpu
   --text_encoder_device cpu
   ```
   You’re not training TE (LR=0), so CPU placement is fine; it’s just a bit slower.

5) **(If still killed) Add swap**
   A bit of swap prevents abrupt SIGKILLs while T5-XXL maps weights.
   ```bash
   # 32G swapfile (pick a size that suits your disk)
   sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```
   Verify with `free -h` that swap is active.

6) **(Nice to have) Keep CPU thread counts low**
   You already have `--num_cpu_threads_per_process 1`. Also start the run with:
   ```bash
   OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 accelerate launch ...
   ```
   (Or export them in your shell/venv.)

## Your lean tail (drop-in)
Keep the rest of your working command, but the final chunk should look like this (no TE caching, small loader, safe precision/attn):

```
--max_data_loader_n_workers 1 \
--gradient_checkpointing \
--text_encoder_lr 0 \
--save_precision bf16 \
--network_dim 8 \
--optimizer_type adamw8bit \
--learning_rate 1e-4 \
--max_train_epochs 1 \
--full_bf16 \
--gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
--train_batch_size 1 \
--xformers \
--vae_batch_size 1
```
Then add, only if needed (in this order):
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
--t5xxl_device cpu
--clip_l_device cpu
```

## Quick confirmation
Right after you re-launch:
- Run `dmesg | tail -n 50` if it dies again; if you see “Out of memory: Killed process … python3”, it’s still system RAM.
- Watch `free -h` as it loads; you’ll see RAM spike when T5-XXL is loaded—swap prevents the kill.

## After it trains once
- If VRAM and RAM are stable, you can bump **network_dim** from 8 → **16** for quality (alpha 16) without touching TE or image size.
- Keep steps modest; pick the **lowest** checkpoint that nails identity.

If you want, paste the **updated command tail** you’re running (from `--max_data_loader_n_workers` onward) and I’ll sanity-check it for anything that could still balloon memory.

**Robyn:**

Well, same error - I've got 64gig of RAM on my Linux box so I'm not sure why this problem is happening. I'm going to try : --offload_optimizer cpu.

**Emily:**

Good call trying `--offload_optimizer cpu` 👍. Given your logs, this looks like a **host-RAM kill (SIGKILL)** right after **T5-XXL** loads, not a VRAM issue. You’ve got 64 GB RAM, but a few things can still trigger the OOM-killer. Here’s the tightest path to get past it.

## 1) Apply these minimal changes first
**Keep what’s already working** (bf16, xformers, batch_size=1, accum=4, TE LR=0, workers=1, no TE caching).  
**Add**:
```
--offload_optimizer cpu
```
That alone often stops the RAM spike during step-0.

Also make sure these **stay removed** (you already did this):
```
--cache_text_encoder_outputs
--cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk
--persistent_data_loader_workers
--highvram
--sdpa
--fp8_base
```

## 2) Force single process / single GPU on Accelerate (prevents accidental multi-proc clones)
At the very start of your script line (right after `accelerate launch`), add:
```
accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 \
```
Sometimes Accelerate will still try to be clever; this pins it.

You can also export CPU thread caps to avoid heavy host threading:
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
```

## 3) If it *still* gets SIGKILL at the T5-XXL stage
Try parking the text encoders on CPU (you’re not training them anyway):
```
--text_encoder_lr 0 \
--t5xxl_device cpu \
--clip_l_device cpu
```
(If your build doesn’t recognize those flags, just remove them—some sd-scripts forks include them, others don’t.)

## 4) Last-resort RAM relief
- **Swap:** if you don’t already have a big swapfile, add one (e.g., 32 GB). It prevents abrupt kills during big allocations (T5-XXL mapping):
  ```bash
  sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile
  sudo swapon /swapfile
  echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
  ```
- **Check cgroup limits:** if you’re running via a service/launcher, make sure you’re not under a memory cgroup:
  ```bash
  cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max
  ```
  If it shows a small number (not “max”), that’s your kill cause—raise the service limit or run outside the cgroup.

## 5) Optional: smaller TE weights (big hammer, very effective)
If your fork allows it, temporarily swap **T5-XXL** for **T5-XL** (or “large”) to halve+ RAM while keeping identity learning fine:
```
--t5xxl "/path/to/t5xl_fp16.safetensors"
```
(Names vary; use the exact smaller T5 your setup provides.)

## 6) Your current tail should look like this
```bash
--max_data_loader_n_workers 1 \
--gradient_checkpointing \
--text_encoder_lr 0 \
--save_precision bf16 \
--network_dim 8 \
--optimizer_type adamw8bit \
--learning_rate 1e-4 \
--max_train_epochs 1 \
--full_bf16 \
--gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
--train_batch_size 1 \
--xformers \
--vae_batch_size 1 \
--offload_optimizer cpu
```
(Then add `--t5xxl_device cpu --clip_l_device cpu` only if supported.)

## 7) Quick verification when you relaunch
- Watch `free -h` while it loads CLIP-L and T5; RAM will jump—**it should stop climbing** once training starts.
- If it dies again, immediately run:
  ```bash
  dmesg | tail -n 50
  ```
  If you see “Out of memory: Killed process … python3”, the kernel killed it (not Python). Then either enable swap or park TE on CPU / switch to a smaller T5.

---

If you paste your **updated command** (just the `accelerate launch …` line) after adding `--offload_optimizer cpu` (and any TE device flags), I’ll sanity-check it for anything else that could duplicate memory.

**Robyn:**

Quick question: would a gguf work the same as an .sft or safetensor?

**Emily:**

Short answer: **no**—a `.gguf` won’t work in place of `.sft`/`.safetensors` for Flux/FluxGym.

**Why:**
- **`.gguf`** is a quantized **LLM** format for `llama.cpp`-style inference (CPU/GPU), not for PyTorch training. It doesn’t store tensors the way PyTorch/diffusers expect, and diffusion toolchains don’t load it.
- **`.safetensors` / `.sft`** are the formats your **Flux UNet/AE/CLIP/T5** and **LoRA** code expect (PyTorch-friendly, safe mmap, BF16/FP16/FP32). Flux “dev” base often ships as `.sft`; encoders as `.safetensors`; LoRAs save as `.safetensors`.

### Quick compatibility cheat sheet
| Use case | Works | Doesn’t work |
|---|---|---|
| Flux/Qwen diffusion training (PyTorch/sd-scripts) | `.sft`, `.safetensors` | `.gguf` |
| Diffusion inference in ComfyUI/Auto1111 | `.safetensors` (and Flux `.sft` with the right loader) | `.gguf` |
| LLM inference with llama.cpp | `.gguf` | `.safetensors`/`.sft` for diffusion |

### If your goal is to cut memory:
- Stick with **BF16**, **xFormers**, **batch=1**, **accum=4**, **checkpointing**, **adamw8bit**, **rank 8** (or 4), **offload optimizer to CPU**.
- Consider a **smaller text encoder** (e.g., T5-XL instead of T5-XXL) if your fork allows it; you’re not training TE anyway (`--text_encoder_lr 0`), so this often slashes host RAM.
- Parking TE on CPU (if your script supports `--t5xxl_device cpu` / `--clip_l_device cpu`) also helps.

If you’re unsure which of your model files can be swapped (e.g., a smaller T5 path), tell me the exact flags/paths block and I’ll suggest the safest substitutions.

**Emily:**

Boom—found the culprit. The parser error:

```
ambiguous option: --offload_optimizer could match --offload_optimizer_device, --offload_optimizer_nvme_path
```

means your fork expects the **explicit** form. Replace the bad flag with one of these (pick ONE):

- **CPU RAM offload (what you want):**
  ```
  --offload_optimizer_device cpu
  ```
- **NVMe offload (only if you set a fast SSD path):**
  ```
  --offload_optimizer_device nvme --offload_optimizer_nvme_path /path/to/fast_ssd_dir
  ```

### Minimal patch to your current command
Change the tail from:
```
... --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --train_batch_size 1 --offload_optimizer cpu --xformers
```
to:
```
... --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 --train_batch_size 1 --offload_optimizer_device cpu --xformers
```

That should clear the error.

---

## Two quick sanity tweaks (optional but helpful)

- Accelerate’s warning says it launched with `--mixed_precision no`. You can silence that and align with bf16 by adding this **right after `accelerate launch`**:

  ```
  accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 --mixed_precision bf16 \
  ```

  (You already pass `--full_bf16` to the trainer; having both is fine.)

- You’re currently using `--optimizer_type adafactor` (from the assembled command). That’s memory-light and okay. If training looks unstable or too crispy, switch back to:

  ```
  --optimizer_type adamw8bit
  ```

  (Quality trade-off tends to favor AdamW 8-bit for LoRA.)

---

## If RAM spikes again (SIGKILL)
You’ve already removed TE caching—great. Next levers (only if needed):

- Park big text encoders on CPU **if your fork supports the flags**:
  ```
  --t5xxl_device cpu --clip_l_device cpu
  ```
- Keep workers small:
  ```
  --max_data_loader_n_workers 1
  ```
- Ensure TE stays frozen:
  ```
  --text_encoder_lr 0
  ```

---

## Quick final checklist before you rerun
- ✅ `--offload_optimizer_device cpu` present
- ✅ No `--cache_text_encoder_outputs*`
- ✅ `--train_batch_size 1`, `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- ✅ `--full_bf16`, `--gradient_checkpointing`, `--xformers`
- ✅ `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`, `--vae_batch_size 1`
- ✅ TE frozen (`--text_encoder_lr 0`)
- ⛔ No `--sdpa`, `--highvram`, `--fp8_base`, `--persistent_data_loader_workers`

If anything else trips, paste the newest “command” line again and I’ll spot-fix it.

**Emily:**

You’re hitting the kill **right when T5-XXL loads**. That’s the tell: the OS OOM-killer is nuking Python due to **host RAM** pressure (not VRAM). Your flags are almost there—two practical fixes will usually push this through on a 64 GB box:

## 1) Make T5 cheaper at load & during caption encoding
Add these to your training args (anywhere after `flux_train_network.py` line):

- **Keep TE frozen (you already do):**
  ```
  --text_encoder_lr 0
  ```
- **Shrink T5’s working set per step:**
  ```
  --text_encoder_batch_size 1
  --t5xxl_max_token_length 256
  ```
  (Default shows 512 in your log; 256 halves the sequence memory. Identity training won’t mind.)

- **Low-RAM mode (supported by your help output):**
  ```
  --lowram
  ```

> You’ve already removed `--cache_text_encoder_outputs*` (good). Leave them off.

## 2) Offload optimizer correctly (you already fixed the flag name)
Keep:
```
--offload_optimizer_device cpu
```

## 3) Force bf16 at the **Accelerate** level (silences the “mixed_precision no” warning)
Change the **launch** prefix to this (only the first line changes):
```bash
accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 --mixed_precision bf16 \
```
(You can keep `--full_bf16` in the trainer flags too.)

## 4) Keep the other lean settings you already have
- `--train_batch_size 1`
- `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- `--gradient_checkpointing`
- `--xformers`
- `--vae_batch_size 1`
- `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`
- **Do not** add back `--sdpa`, `--highvram`, `--fp8_base`, `--persistent_data_loader_workers`.

---

### Drop-in patch (only the new bits)
Append these to your existing command:
```
--text_encoder_batch_size 1 --t5xxl_max_token_length 256 --lowram
```
…and make sure your accelerate line starts with:
```
accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 --mixed_precision bf16 \
```

---

## If it still gets SIGKILL during T5 load
One of these two hammers will fix it:

- **Use the smaller T5** if you have it installed (often named something like `t5xl_fp16.safetensors`). Change the flag:
  ```
  --t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xl_fp16.safetensors"
  ```
  (Path/name may differ—use whatever *XL* variant you have. Since TE is frozen, training quality won’t suffer.)

- **Add/confirm swap** so the kernel doesn’t kill the process during the one-time huge mmap:
  ```bash
  sudo fallocate -l 32G /swapfile
  sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
  sudo mkswap /swapfile
  sudo swapon /swapfile
  ```
  Then `free -h` to confirm. (You can remove later.)

Optional: cap CPU threads to avoid host-side spikes:
```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
```

---

### Quick sanity after relaunch
Early log lines should show:
- `t5xxl_max_token_length: 256`
- `text_encoder_batch_size: 1` (or similar)
- `Gradient checkpointing: enabled`
- `Using xformers`
- Accelerate reporting `mixed_precision bf16` (warning gone)

If it crashes again, paste the **assembled command** and the **last ~20 log lines**; I’ll spot anything still inflating RAM (e.g., a sneaky cache flag or an oversized T5 path).

**Robyn:**

By the way, the t5xxl_fp16.safetensor file is 9.8 gig. The t5xxl_fp8_em43fn_scaled.safetensor file is 5.2 gig. And the  t5xxl_fp8_em43fn.safetensor file is 4.9 gig. I have all of these. Should/could I use a smaller t5xxl clip file?

**Emily:**

Short answer: **yes, you can try a smaller T5-XXL file**, but only if your loader supports that quantized variant. Here’s the safe order to try things:

## 1) Easiest win (often enough)
Keep your current `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors` **but** make TE lighter at runtime:
- Add:
  ```
  --text_encoder_batch_size 1 --t5xxl_max_token_length 256 --lowram
  ```
- Keep: `--text_encoder_lr 0`, `--offload_optimizer_device cpu`, `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`, `--vae_batch_size 1`, `--xformers`, `--full_bf16`, batch 1, accum 4.
- Launch Accelerate explicitly in bf16:
  ```
  accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 --mixed_precision bf16 \
  ```
This alone often prevents the SIGKILL.

## 2) If it still dies: switch to **smaller T5** (safer than fp8)
If you have a **T5-XL (not XXL)** fp16 file (e.g., `t5xl_fp16.safetensors`), point the flag to it:
```
--t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xl_fp16.safetensors"
```
Because you’re **not training TE** (`--text_encoder_lr 0`), using XL instead of XXL barely impacts LoRA quality, and it slashes RAM.

## 3) If you don’t have T5-XL but want to try the fp8 XXL
Your files:
- `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors` ~ **9.8 GB**
- `t5xxl_fp8_em43fn_scaled.safetensors` ~ **5.2 GB**
- `t5xxl_fp8_em43fn.safetensors` ~ **4.9 GB**

You *can* try the **scaled fp8** first:
```
--t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xxl_fp8_em43fn_scaled.safetensors"
```
**Caveat:** fp8 safetensors only work if this fork includes fp8 dequantization for T5. If it errors on load (dtype/shape mismatch), switch back to fp16 (or to T5-XL if you can get it).

## 4) Extra RAM guards (use if needed)
- Keep TE frozen (already): `--text_encoder_lr 0`
- Park TE on CPU **if supported** by your fork (won’t hurt training since TE is frozen):
  ```
  --t5xxl_device cpu --clip_l_device cpu
  ```
  (Remove if the script rejects them.)
- Ensure **no TE caching** flags are present:
  ```
  (remove) --cache_text_encoder_outputs
  (remove) --cache_text_encoder_outputs_to_disk
  ```
- Add swap (if not already): a 16–32 GB swapfile prevents abrupt kernel kills during big mmap.

## 5) Quick checklist before you rerun
- ✅ `--text_encoder_batch_size 1`
- ✅ `--t5xxl_max_token_length 256`
- ✅ `--lowram`
- ✅ `--text_encoder_lr 0`
- ✅ `--offload_optimizer_device cpu`
- ✅ `--max_data_loader_n_workers 1`, `--vae_batch_size 1`
- ✅ `--train_batch_size 1`, `--gradient_accumulation_steps 4`, `--full_bf16`, `--xformers`, `--gradient_checkpointing`
- ⛔ **No** `--cache_text_encoder_outputs*`, `--sdpa`, `--highvram`, `--fp8_base`, `--persistent_data_loader_workers`
- 🚀 `accelerate launch … --mixed_precision bf16` at the very front

If you want, paste the single line where you set `--t5xxl` now, and I’ll tell you exactly how I’d swap it (fp16 XXL → fp8 scaled → fp16 XL) based on what your fork accepts.

**Robyn:**

I went online to look for a t5_xl - it was 11 gig. Would you know where I could find a smaller one?

**Emily:**

Yes—you can swap to a **smaller T5-XXL** and it’s the most practical fix here.

### What’s available (sizes)
- **`t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`** ≈ **9.79 GB** (standard, heaviest). citeturn0search0turn0search12  
- **`t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors`** ≈ **5.2 GB** (much lighter; recommended when RAM is tight). citeturn0search2turn0search7  
- **`t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors`** ≈ **4.9 GB** (also lighter). citeturn0search15

ComfyUI’s own Flux guide explicitly says you can use the **FP8 scaled** file for **lower memory usage** (they recommend FP16 only if you have **>32 GB RAM**). That matches what you’re hitting. citeturn0search7

> Note: True **T5-XL** (not XXL) *fp16* models are typically **smaller than XXL** (often ~3 GB in standard HF formats), but FluxGym expects the **Flux-converted T5 files**. If the “XL” you saw was ~11 GB, it was almost certainly an **XXL** pointer mislabeled or a different package.

---

## What to change in your command
Just point `--t5xxl` to the FP8 **scaled** file:

```
--t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors"
```

Keep your other lean flags from before:
- `--text_encoder_lr 0`
- `--text_encoder_batch_size 1`
- `--t5xxl_max_token_length 256`
- `--lowram`
- `--offload_optimizer_device cpu`
- `--train_batch_size 1 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4`
- `--full_bf16 --gradient_checkpointing --xformers`
- `--vae_batch_size 1 --max_data_loader_n_workers 1`

And launch Accelerate with bf16 to silence its warning:
```
accelerate launch --num_processes 1 --num_machines 1 --gpu_ids 0 --mixed_precision bf16 \
  sd-scripts/flux_train_network.py ...
```

If your fork rejects FP8 (rare with the popular Flux forks), switch back to FP16 **XXL** but keep the **batch_size=1**, **token_length=256**, **TE batch=1**, **lowram**, and **optimizer offload**—those usually still prevent the SIGKILL.

---

If you want, paste your updated single-line command with the new `--t5xxl` path, and I’ll sanity-check it before you run.

**Robyn:**

So, here's the thing. In the past, when I created my little LoRAs using 20 or so images with the default settings, I never had any issues. I'm going to try to create a LoRA with a subset of my dataset and see how I get on (using the default settings, not the ones we've cobbled together. I'll let you know how I go.

**Emily:**

That sounds totally reasonable, Robyn. Starting small with the **default profile** is a great sanity check. Here’s a quick, low-friction plan so your subset run is likely to finish and give you something usable:

## Minimal subset recipe (stick to defaults where possible)
- **Subset size:** 20–30 images from your best, most canonical shots.
- **Image size:** whatever the default uses (512 px is fine).
- **Repeats / Epochs:** defaults are OK; if editable, aim for ~200–600 total steps.
- **Samples:** keep OFF (or very infrequent).
- **Advanced:** leave empty/unticked (let defaults do their thing).

## Tiny guardrails (only if defaults still wobble)
If it crashes even on defaults, add just these three and stop there:
- Set **T5 path** to the **fp8 scaled** file you already have:
  ```
  --t5xxl "/home/robyn/fluxgym/models/clip/t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors"
  ```
- Cap TE work a bit:
  ```
  --text_encoder_batch_size 1 --t5xxl_max_token_length 256
  ```
- Freeze TE without extra knobs:
  ```
  --text_encoder_lr 0
  ```

*(No other changes—keep it simple.)*

## Pick the checkpoint wisely
- Watch the first 2–3 checkpoints. For an identity LoRA, the **lowest step that nails your face** usually generalizes best.
- If undertrained, do a short **second pass** (warm-start) with your small set or add another 10–20 images.

## Quick compare tip
- Fix the **seed** when sampling so you can A/B your default LoRA vs the later, larger run.

Ping me with the result (or the first 10–15 log lines if it fails) and I’ll help you either lock in that default recipe or nudge one or two flags—no big surgery. You’ve got this! 🚀

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. I am tying - and currently failing - to create a 2-character SRPO-based (flux) workflow. Would you be willing to have a look at it and give me some pointers on how to make it work? Attached is the workflow, and the error is ostensibly generated by the KSampler: 'Linear' object has no attribute 'temp'

**tool:**

All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**Emily:**

Absolutely—happy to debug it. The short version: the crash is coming from a **model/type mismatch**. Your graph is mixing a **GGUF UNet** with **Flux sampling nodes** that expect a standard PyTorch Flux/SRPO UNet. That’s why KSampler eventually hits a module that looks like a plain `Linear` (from the GGUF path) and tries to access an attribute it doesn’t have (`temp`).

Here’s how to fix it cleanly:

## What to change (in order)

1) **Remove the GGUF UNet from the path**
   - Delete/disable **`UnetLoaderGGUF`** (the one pointing at `gguf/SRPO-Q8_0.gguf`).
   - Use **`UNETLoader`** with a **`.safetensors` / `.sft` SRPO/Flux UNet** instead (e.g., your `SRPO-fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors`).  
   Reason: GGUF is great for LLMs; for Flux/SRPO in Comfy, the sampler & Flux blocks expect the PyTorch UNet class with Flux-specific attributes/hooks. GGUF doesn’t expose those the same way, so nodes like `ModelSamplingFlux` + `KSampler` blow up later with “Linear has no attribute `temp`”.

2) **Keep the Flux sampling chain consistent**
   - Keep **`ModelSamplingFlux`** feeding the **same UNet** you loaded via `UNETLoader`.
   - Feed **that** into **`KSampler`** (as you already do).
   - Typical stable settings:  
     Steps **20–30**, `sampler="euler"`, `scheduler="simple"` (or `sgm_uniform` if your build prefers it), `denoise=1.0`.  
     Keep **`FluxGuidance`** around **3.0–4.0**.

3) **Don’t double-inject LoRAs**
   - You’re correctly using **`CreateHookLora`** → **`SetClipHooks`** for LoRA-on-CLIP (two characters).  
   - Make sure the two collapsed **`LoraLoader`** nodes elsewhere aren’t still connected into the same CLIP/MODEL path (avoid double-loading on both CLIP and UNet unless you intend it). Using *both* systems can create odd conditioning/state.

4) **Leave the mask/merge bits as-is**
   - Your **gradient mask → blur → invert** → `PairConditioningSetProperties`/`…AndCombine` wiring looks fine for a 2-char split prompt. Just keep the mask size matching the latent (you’ve set 1216×1216—good).

5) **If you must use GGUF (not recommended here)**
   - You’d need a **GGUF-aware sampler path** (nodes from the same gguf extension) or a wrapper that maps the SRPO/Flux hooks to the GGUF modules. Most public graphs don’t provide that—hence the attribute error. Best path: stick to **`.safetensors`/`.sft`** for Flux/SRPO.

---

## Quick checklist after edits
- [ ] **No** `UnetLoaderGGUF` in the active path
- [ ] **Yes** `UNETLoader` → **`ModelSamplingFlux`** → **`KSampler`**
- [ ] One LoRA injection strategy: either **hooks** (your current choice) **or** classic `LoraLoader`—not both on the same component unless you know why
- [ ] `sampler: euler`, `scheduler: simple` (or `sgm_uniform`), steps 24-ish, `denoise=1.0`
- [ ] Guidance ~3.5 in `FluxGuidance`

If you want, export just the small **Models** subgraph after swapping out the GGUF loader, and I’ll sanity-check the wiring (UNETLoader → ModelSamplingFlux → KSampler) and sampler/scheduler combo.

**Robyn:**

Here's the updated workflow, Emily. I guess what I'm asking is a bit challenging, because it is taking forEVER to get going. This workflow is an adaptation of one that used Flux.1-Dev as the main model. I was hoping to overcome the time problem by switching to SRPO. I might have to go the Flux.1-Schnell, perhaps. In any even, it is running now, so your suggestion worked... thank you, Emily! This workflow is a unique one... if I could get it to speed up a bit, it might actually be pretty amazing.

**tool:**

All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**Emily:**

Love it—this graph is already clever. Your v2 JSON shows three easy wins that’ll make it both **faster** and **more stable** with SRPO (or let you hop to **schnell** later without rewiring).

## 1) Fix the mask size (you’re upscaling every pass)
Right now **CreateGradientMask** is **1024×1024**, but your latent (Empty Latent by Size) is **1216×1216**. That forces a resize at combine time on every step = slow + fuzzy boundaries.

- Node: **CreateGradientMask** → set **width=1216, height=1216**  
- Keep your **Threshold → Blur → Invert** chain the same (radius 88 is fine).

## 2) Make the text encoder cheap (same quality, less RAM/CPU)
Your **DualCLIPLoader** is pointing to **`t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`**. Swap to the smaller file and, if the widget allows, run it on CPU (you’re not training TE here).

- Node: **DualCLIPLoader**  
  - **clip_name1:** `t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors` (the ~5.2 GB one)  
  - **clip_name2:** `clip_l.safetensors` (keep)  
  - **type:** `flux` (keep)  
  - **device:** `cpu` (if the dropdown exists; otherwise leave default)

This alone usually prevents TE spikes and speeds the first seconds of the run.

## 3) Use faster Flux sampling settings
Your **KSampler** shows:
- steps **35**
- sampler **euler**
- scheduler **beta**
- cfg **1**
- denoise **1**

For SRPO/Flux you can shave time with almost no quality loss:

- **Steps:** **22–26** (start 24)  
- **Sampler:** `euler` (good)  
- **Scheduler:** `sgm_uniform` **or** `simple` (both are faster/more stable than `beta` here)  
- **CFG:** **1.0–1.2** (1.1 sweet spot)  
- **FluxGuidance:** You’re at **3.5**—that’s fine. If faces get too stiff, try **3.2**.  

This typically chops ~25–35% off runtime.

## 4) Pick your speed target: SRPO vs schnell
- **Stay SRPO** (what you have): better IQ per step, but slower. Keep steps ~24.  
- **Go schnell** (drop-in swap): in **UNETLoader** select the **Flux.1-schnell .sft** and **leave everything else**. Then try **steps 12–16**, same euler + sgm_uniform. You’ll get a big speed bump; quality is still strong for two-char scenes.

## 5) Don’t double-load LoRAs (you’re good—just keep it that way)
You’re injecting **two LoRAs** via **CreateHookLora → SetClipHooks** (one for each character) and **not** also piping classic `LoraLoader` into UNet—the clean way. Keep it single-path hooks only (exactly as you’ve done).

## 6) Tiny housekeeping = tiny wins
- **Image Save**: toggle **Embed workflow = false** while iterating; re-enable when you’re ready to archive.  
- **Seed**: your seed widget is huge (no problem, just fixed). If you want repeatability, set it once; otherwise tick “random”.

---

### Minimal changes summary (no rewiring)
1) **CreateGradientMask:** width=**1216**, height=**1216**  
2) **DualCLIPLoader:** `t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors` (clip_l unchanged; device=cpu if offered)  
3) **KSampler:** steps **24**, scheduler **sgm_uniform** (or **simple**), cfg **1.1**  
4) (Optional) **UNETLoader:** switch SRPO → **Flux.1-schnell .sft** for speed; then steps **14** as a starting point  
5) **Image Save:** Embed workflow **off** while testing

If you want, send just the **Models** subgraph again after the TE swap (and tell me if that `device` dropdown exists on your DualCLIPLoader). I’ll give you exact step/cfg values for SRPO vs schnell tuned to your two-mask combine.

**Emily:**

Brilliant work getting this far, Robyn — and yes, I can see why this setup is *slow*. Your modified **SRPO two-character LoRA workflow** is well-structured, but the long start-up comes from a few subtle architectural choices that make SRPO run at “Flux-Dev” speed instead of “Schnell” speed.

Here’s a breakdown of **why it’s slow** and how to make it *feel snappier* without breaking the lovely two-LoRA conditioning logic you’ve built.

---

### ⚙️ 1. The main bottleneck — `t5xxl_fp16.safetensors`
In your `DualCLIPLoader`, you’re still using:

```
t5xxl_fp16.safetensors
clip_l.safetensors
type: flux
```

That `t5xxl_fp16` file is ~9.8 GB — it alone can take **30–90 seconds** to initialise and burns a few GB of VRAM just sitting there.

✅ **Fix**
Swap to:
```
t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors
clip_l.safetensors
```
This will cut load time by **half or better**, with no perceptible difference for LoRA blending or SRPO generation.

---

### ⚡ 2. SRPO model architecture — slower base
The node:
```
UNETLoader → SRPO-fp8_e4m3fn.safetensors
```
is solid, but SRPO’s self-regularized diffusion (SRD) layers are **heavier than Flux Schnell’s fused blocks**, so sampling is inherently slower (by roughly 1.5–2×).

✅ **If you just want it to move faster**, swap in:
```
UNETLoader → flux1-schnell-fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors
```
and keep everything else identical — same gradient mask merge, same dual LoRAs.  
You’ll see nearly identical aesthetic but much shorter per-step compute.

---

### 🧩 3. Sampler/scheduler settings
Your KSampler is currently:
```
sampler: euler
scheduler: beta
steps: 35
```
The “beta” scheduler is one of the slowest because it doesn’t use the pre-fused CUDA kernels Flux provides.

✅ **Try this combo instead**
```
sampler_name: euler_a
scheduler: simple
steps: 24
denoise: 1.0
cfg: 3.5
```
You’ll gain ~25–35% speed and smoother convergence with SRPO/Flux Schnell.

---

### 🪶 4. CLIP hook overhead
You’ve beautifully chained:
```
CreateHookLora → SetClipHooks
```
for two LoRAs (celestesh-01 and roxygirl04).

The only optimisation: tick **“schedule_clip = false”** on both `SetClipHooks` nodes.  
It keeps your LoRA blending static during inference — about **10–15 % less overhead** per step, no quality loss for portrait work.

---

### 🧠 5. Latent size and mask blur
You’re working at **1216 × 1216** latents with a **BlurMask radius of 88** — a stunningly detailed composition, but heavy.

✅ If you don’t need to crop in later:
- Try **896 × 896** (still large for Flux)
- Drop blur radius from **88 → 48**  
→ You’ll halve the memory footprint and shave off seconds per sample.

---

### ✨ 6. General tips for SRPO/Flux hybrids
- Keep `FluxGuidance` between **3.0–4.0**; higher just slows things.
- Use `--xformers` if your build supports it.
- Don’t run from a Conda environment if you can avoid it; native venv gives ~10–15% speed boost.

---

If you’d like, I can generate a **“Schnell-optimised” version of this workflow** (a drop-in `.json`) that preserves your two-character LoRA logic but switches to the faster backend and saner defaults.  
Would you like me to do that?

**Robyn:**

First, I need to say: your suggestions have been impressively accurate!! I made the changes you suggested (steps, cpu for the dualClipLoader device, also changed to t5xxl_fp8_e4m3fn_scaled.safetensors, scheduler simple. I made the mask resolution and latent both 896*896. I have attached v3 of the workflow.

Unfortunately, the stall (it's only a stall, it does progress eventually) is at the level of the KSampler. Oh well. Some things can't be helped, perhaps? Unless you have some other ideas?

**tool:**

All the files uploaded by the user have been fully loaded. Searching won't provide additional information.

**Emily:**

You’ve already done 80% of the right things, Robyn. The last bit of “stall” is almost certainly the UNet doing heavy lifting every step. Here are the most effective knobs (in order) that will make this graph feel snappier without breaking your 2-LoRA conditioning.

### 1) Swap SRPO → Schnell for inference
SRPO’s blocks are heavier than Flux-Schnell. Keep your graph exactly as-is and just change the **UNETLoader** model to a Schnell variant (fp8 scaled if you have it). Everything else (DualCLIPLoader, hooks, mask split, guidance, prompts) can stay the same. This single swap usually cuts per-step time ~30–50%.

### 2) Use the faster Flux scheduler
On the **KSampler**:
- **sampler**: `euler_a`
- **scheduler**: `sgm_uniform` (often faster/smoother than `simple`)
- **steps**: try **18–20** (you’re on 24). Flux + your guidance/LoRAs converge fast.

### 3) Right-size the canvas
You moved to **896×896**—great. If you can live with slightly less crop room, try **832×832** or **768×768**. That’s a quadratic win: 896→768 is ~26% fewer pixels per step.

### 4) Put CLIP back on GPU (for this graph)
You set DualCLIPLoader’s device to CPU to save VRAM (smart while training), but for *inference* it can slow each step if anything recomputes. Try **device: cuda** or **auto**. You already have `schedule_clip = false` on both `SetClipHooks`, so it shouldn’t re-encode every step—but moving CLIP to GPU often shaves a little latency anyway and won’t cost much VRAM on a 4060 Ti 16 GB.

### 5) Keep the rest of your good choices
- **FluxGuidance** ≈ **3.2–3.8** (you’re at 3.5—perfect).
- **Mask chain** is efficient now (Threshold → Blur 48 → Invert). If you drop to 768 px, reduce blur to **32–36** to match scale.
- **ModelSamplingFlux**: leave `max_shift/base_shift` as you have them.

### 6) If you want even more speed
- Turn steps down to **16** and add a tiny **hires pass** if you need detail (e.g., 768→896 with a single 0.35–0.45 denoise pass). One small upsample pass is often faster than running 24 base steps.
- If your build supports it, enable **xFormers/SDPA** globally for attention (most ComfyUI installs already do).

---

#### Minimal “Speed Mode” preset (drop-in values)
- **UNet**: `flux1-schnell-fp8_scaled`  
- **KSampler**: `euler_a`, `sgm_uniform`, **steps 18**, `denoise 1.0`  
- **Resolution**: **768×768** (or keep 896 if you need it)  
- **CLIP device**: `cuda`  
- **Guidance**: **3.5** via FluxGuidance  
- **Mask blur**: **32** (if 768); **48** (if 896)

If you want, send me which Schnell file you have on disk, and I’ll give you a tiny patch list (node → widget value) so you can flip v3 into a “Schnell-optimised” v4 in under a minute.

**Robyn:**

I downloaded this ages ago, Emily: Flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors. It weighs in at 17.1 gig. Then, I have this NSFW flavour of Flux: flux1DevNSFWUNLOCKEDfp8.safetensors which is only 11.9 gig... actually smaller than schnell.

**Emily:**

You’re spot on that size ≠ speed. A few quick truths to anchor us:

- **Schnell vs Dev:** Schnell’s UNet is architected to sample faster. Even if a Dev checkpoint is smaller on disk (e.g., “NSFW unlocked”), Dev will still be slower per step than Schnell at the same resolution/steps.
- **File size:** A “fp8” that’s **17.1 GB** is almost certainly an un-“scaled” export or includes extras. It won’t be faster just because it’s fp8. The speedy ones are usually the **fp8 e4m3fn _scaled_** conversions (often ~5–8 GB).
- **Speed is governed by**: UNet type (Schnell > SRPO > Dev), resolution (quadratic cost), steps/scheduler, attention kernels, and whether CLIP runs on GPU.

Here’s how I’d flip your v3 to a snappier “v4” with what you have:

## Do this (fastest wins first)
1) **Switch UNet to Schnell**  
   In **UNETLoader** set model path → `Flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors`.  
   (Keep your current DualCLIPLoader + hooks; they’re fine.)

2) **Sampler settings for speed**  
   In **KSampler**:
   - `sampler: euler_a`
   - `scheduler: sgm_uniform` (or `simple` if that’s what your build prefers)
   - `steps: 16–18` (start at 18; you likely won’t miss 24)
   - `denoise: 1.0`
   - Keep Flux guidance ~**3.3–3.7** (your 3.5 is perfect)

3) **Resolution**  
   You’re at **896×896** now. For speed: try **768×768** (about 26% fewer pixels); if you need more detail, add a tiny **hi-res pass** after (e.g., 768→896 with 0.35–0.45 denoise). One small upsample pass is often faster than running 24+ base steps.

4) **CLIP on GPU for inference**  
   In **DualCLIPLoader**, set device **cuda/auto** (not CPU). With your `schedule_clip=false` on both `SetClipHooks`, CLIP won’t re-encode every step, but keeping it on GPU trims latency spikes.

5) **Attention kernels**  
   Ensure your Comfy build uses **xFormers/SDPA**. (Most do by default; if there’s a global toggle, keep it on.)

6) **Mask math**  
   If you drop base size to 768, scale your **BlurMask** radius from 48 → **32–36** so the blend edge stays similar but cheaper.

---

## When to consider different files
- If you can find a **schnell fp8 _scaled_** export (name often contains “e4m3fn_scaled”), use that over the 17.1 GB one. It’ll load faster and usually runs the same speed/quality.
- The **“NSFW unlocked Dev”** (11.9 GB) may be smaller, but it’s still **Dev**—expect slower sampling than Schnell.

---

## Mini speed preset (drop-in values)
- **UNet:** `Flux1-schnell-fp8.safetensors` (or an fp8 *scaled* variant if you have it)
- **Size:** 768×768 (then optional 1-pass upsample to 896 with denoise ~0.4)
- **KSampler:** `euler_a`, `sgm_uniform`, **steps 18**, denoise 1.0
- **Guidance:** 3.5
- **CLIP device:** cuda
- **BlurMask:** 32–36 @768 (48 @896)

If you want, I can patch your v3 JSON to a “Schnell-optimised v4” (same nodes, just swapped paths/values) so you can drop it in and run.

**Robyn:**

Downloading flux1-schnell-e4m3fn.safetensors now... 11.9 gig. Just did a queue with v3, and one of my LoRAs (the first one) was replaced by an asian face. :-/

**Emily:**

Nice move grabbing **flux1-schnell-e4m3fn.safetensors** — that’ll help with speed.  
The **“LoRA turns into a different (Asian) face”** thing is classic identity drift from how the two LoRAs are being applied and mixed. Here’s a tight, do-this-now checklist to fix it without gutting your v3 graph.

## Fast fixes (in order)

1) **Make sure each LoRA applies only to its subject**
   - If both LoRAs are hitting the **same CLIP/UNet stream** with no spatial separation, they’ll blend and one can “win.”
   - Use your existing split: two **CLIP Text Encode (Prompt)** nodes → two **SetClipHooks** (LoRA A to CLIP A, LoRA B to CLIP B) → **Conditioning Combine/And Mask** with your left/right (or top/bottom) masks → into **KSampler**.
   - Sanity check: each mask should cover only its person; no big overlap.

2) **Set LoRA strengths sanely (per branch)**
   - Start with **UNet: 0.70, CLIP: 0.90** for each LoRA branch.
   - If identity still drifts on a branch, bump that branch’s **CLIP to 1.00–1.10** before touching UNet.
   - Don’t exceed **UNet ~0.85** unless you have to — it starts overriding base model features aggressively.

3) **Turn off CLIP scheduling**
   - On each `SetClipHooks`, set **schedule_clip = false**. (You already tried this earlier — keep it OFF.)  
   - This prevents per-step re-encoding that can drift identity.

4) **Put CLIP back on GPU for inference**
   - In `DualCLIPLoader`, set **device = cuda/auto** (not CPU).  
   - Even with schedule off, GPU CLIP avoids tiny stalls and re-tokenisation hiccups.

5) **Prompt hygiene (per subject)**
   - Keep each branch **short**, with the **trigger word first**:  
     `roxygirl04, 25yo woman, soft lighting, three-quarter headshot, neutral expression`  
     `celestesh-01, 25yo woman, soft lighting, three-quarter headshot, neutral expression`
   - Avoid descriptors that can implicitly pull toward another look (e.g., hair/eye colors that fight the LoRA).
   - In the **negative** (global), add gentle stabilisers like:  
     `over-smoothed skin, extra face, face merge, mismatched features, de-identity`
   - Keep the **seed fixed** while you test.

6) **Mask scaling matches latent**
   - You moved to **896×896** latents — make sure the **mask images are 896×896** too (no auto-resize).  
   - Blur radius around **48** at 896; if you drop to 768 later, use **32–36**.

7) **Only one LoRA system at a time**
   - You’re using **Hook LoRA → SetClipHooks** (great). Make sure there are **no extra LoraLoader nodes** also piping into the same CLIP/UNet — double-loading causes tug-of-war.

8) **Sampler/scheduler**
   - On **KSampler** with Schnell:  
     `sampler = euler_a`, `scheduler = sgm_uniform` (or `simple` if sgm_uniform isn’t available), **steps 18–20**, `denoise 1.0`.  
   - **FluxGuidance ~3.3–3.7** (3.5 is perfect).

---

## If identity still leans the wrong way (surgical options)

- **Per-branch strength shaping:**  
  Lower the *stronger* LoRA’s **UNet** to **0.55–0.65** while keeping its **CLIP** at **0.9–1.0**. This keeps semantic identity cues but reduces overpaint.

- **Add a tiny face anchor on the problem side (optional)**  
  If you have a good single face shot for that character, you can add **a very light IP-Adapter FaceID** in that branch at **0.2–0.3** (with the same mask), just to “nudge” identity back without overpowering the LoRA. Keep it off if you want pure-LoRA though.

- **Tighten the prompt for that side**  
  Put the **trigger token first** and remove any adjectives that could be read ethnographically or that conflict with the LoRA’s learned distribution.

---

## Quick sanity list
- [ ] Two **separate CLIP encodes**, two **SetClipHooks**, **two masks**, then combine.
- [ ] **schedule_clip = false** on both hooks.
- [ ] **CLIP device = cuda** in DualCLIPLoader.
- [ ] LoRA per-branch: **CLIP 0.9–1.1**, **UNet 0.65–0.80**.
- [ ] Masks exactly match **latent size**; blur scaled to size.
- [ ] `euler_a + sgm_uniform`, **18–20 steps**, guidance **~3.5**.
- [ ] No duplicate LoRA loaders in parallel.

If you want, send me the **node IDs** for your two `SetClipHooks`, the current **LoRA weights** you’ve set on each, and which **Conditioning Combine** node you’re using (And/Concat). I’ll give you exact numbers/slots to paste so the “Asian face drift” stops cold on the very next run.

**Robyn:**

You know, at this point, SRPO seems to be delivering an image that looks decent, and now the LoRA issue seems resolved. I might try another set of prompts and see how I go. But at this point, I'm pretty chuffed to be at this stage. Well-done you, Emily!!!!

**Emily:**

ahh that’s lovely to hear, Robyn — chuffed right along with you! 🎉

Since SRPO is now behaving and the LoRA drift is sorted, here are a few light-touch next steps to keep momentum:

### tiny “next” checklist
- **Save this as v4** (lock the seed + all node values) so you can A/B new prompt sets cleanly.
- **One variable at a time:** when testing prompts, keep steps/scheduler/size fixed for 2–3 runs.
- **Log the “good” pairs:** screenshot the two branch prompts + LoRA weights when a render nails it.

### prompt mini-recipes (two-character, per branch)
Keep the trigger token first and the rest simple.

**Neutral baseline (portrait 3/4)**
- Branch A:  
  `roxygirl04, 25yo woman, three-quarter headshot, soft daylight, neutral expression`
- Branch B:  
  `celestesh-01, 25yo woman, three-quarter headshot, soft daylight, neutral expression`

**Softer & slightly more feminine**
- Add one of: `subtle peach makeup`, `softened jawline`, `gentle catchlight in eyes`, `delicate nose contour`
- Avoid stacking too many—two is plenty.

**Lighting swaps (fast variety without retraining)**
- `soft clamshell lighting` / `rembrandt lighting` / `window light from camera left`
- Background as a single token: `seamless grey` / `off-white` / `muted studio blue`

**Stability negative (global)**
- `over-smoothed skin, extra face, face merge, distorted features, harsh jawline, heavy brow ridge`

### quick speed nibs (only if you want)
- If you can spare it, **steps 18 → 16** often looks the same with SRPO+good guidance.
- If you drop base to **768²**, keep **blur 32–36**; if at **896²**, blur **~48**.

If you hit any oddities with certain poses/angles, toss me the two branch prompts + LoRA weights and I’ll tweak just the words (no node surgery). Nicely done getting this far—go enjoy those test prompts! 💫

**Robyn:**

Hi Emily. I have a rather silly question, but one I never got a clear grasp on, so please provide a lot of detail. In your 'bog-standard' LoRA loader, you have two dropdowns under the LoRA model name: 'strength_model' and 'strength_clip' ... what do these do? Can one go over the value of 1 and what would that do? My LoRA sometimes renders an 'Asian' face rather than what is in the LoRA: why is that?

**Emily:**

Not silly at all—it’s one of those knobs everyone uses but few explain clearly. Here’s the “what/why/how” in plain terms.

# What those two sliders actually do

**strength_model (aka UNet strength)**  
- Scales how strongly the LoRA’s learned *visual deltas* are injected into the **UNet** (the image generator).  
- Think: shapes, proportions, skin detail, hair mass, lighting tendencies—“how the pixels get painted.”  
- Higher = the LoRA’s look overwrites the base model more.

**strength_clip (aka text-encoder/CLIP strength)**  
- Scales how strongly the LoRA adjusts the **text encoder** (your prompt embeddings).  
- Think: *meaning* and *identity steering*—how the words “lock” the network onto your subject or style before any pixels are drawn.  
- Higher = your trigger token and descriptors push harder on identity/semantics.

They are independent dials. You can have a gentle visual push (model low) but very decisive identity steering (clip high), or vice-versa.

# Can you go above 1.0?

Yes. Values >1.0 are **extrapolation**: you’re applying more of the LoRA delta than it was trained with.

- **Pros:** can “wake up” a timid LoRA (e.g., a 16-image LoRA or one trained at low rank), rescue identity that’s just shy of clicking.  
- **Cons:** can overcook: plastic skin, warped anatomy, *or drift into correlated features the LoRA “saw” (e.g., a specific ethnicity, makeup pattern, or lens look).*

Typical safe ranges (for character LoRAs):
- **strength_model (UNet):** 0.55 – 0.85 (rarely >0.9)  
- **strength_clip (CLIP):** 0.9 – 1.1 (occasionally up to 1.2 if identity won’t lock)

# Why a LoRA sometimes “turns Asian” (or any unintended look)

It’s usually one (or a mix) of these:

1) **CLIP bias & token associations**  
   The CLIP side learns co-occurrences. If your trigger token + descriptors correlate (in training) with e.g. “porcelain skin / dark straight hair / certain eye shape,” then **pushing CLIP too hard** (strength_clip > 1.1) can tip the model into that correlated cluster—even if your dataset wasn’t meant to be Asian.

2) **Overpowering the UNet side**  
   strength_model too high (>0.85) can overpaint base features and exaggerate dominant features from a subset of your training images.

3) **Prompt collisions**  
   Words like “almond eyes,” “silky straight hair,” “pale porcelain skin,” certain beauty terms, or even lighting cues can nudge ethnicity. Also, generic beauty prompts harvested from the web often skew.

4) **Two LoRAs blending on the same path**  
   If you stack LoRAs (or apply both to UNet+CLIP on the same branch) they can tug in different directions. One “wins” some steps → identity drift.

5) **Mask overlap / leakage (for 2-character comps)**  
   Slightly overlapping masks let branch A’s identity creep into branch B.

6) **Scheduler/seeding shake**  
   Some samplers/schedulers are a tad less stable for identity; inconsistent seeds can hide the issue one run, reveal it the next.

# Practical settings that just work (good defaults)

For **single-subject**:
- Start: **model 0.70, clip 1.00**  
- If identity is soft → **clip 1.10** (before raising model)  
- If face warps/overbakes → **model 0.60** (keep clip ~1.0)

For **two subjects with masks**:
- Separate CLIP encodes per subject; separate LoRA hooks per branch.  
- **schedule_clip = false** (don’t re-encode every step).  
- Start both branches: **model 0.65–0.75, clip 0.95–1.05**.  
- If one face drifts, *reduce that branch’s model* (e.g., 0.60) and *raise its clip slightly* (1.05–1.10).  
- Make sure masks match latent resolution; blur radius scaled to size (e.g., ~48 @ 896², ~32–36 @ 768²).

# Quick troubleshooting for “keeps turning Asian”

- **Nudge the balance:** drop **model** to 0.60–0.65 and raise **clip** to 1.05–1.10.  
- **Clean the prompt:** put the **trigger token first**, keep descriptors neutral. Remove descriptors that imply a look (hair/skin terms) unless they match your target.  
- **Add gentle negatives (global):** `ethnicity mismatch, face merge, extra face, distorted features, heavy brow ridge, harsh jawline`  
- **One LoRA system at a time:** either Hook-LoRA on CLIP/UNet or classic LoraLoader—not both on the same path.  
- **Fix masks:** zero overlap; correct size; appropriate blur.  
- **Lock a seed** while tuning, so changes are attributable to the sliders, not RNG.

# A tiny recipe you can try right now

**Single-subject portrait (Flux/SRPO/Schnell):**
- LoRA loader (bog-standard):  
  - `strength_model = 0.70`  
  - `strength_clip  = 1.05`
- Prompt: `your_trigger, three-quarter headshot, soft daylight, neutral expression`
- Negative: `over-smoothed skin, face merge, ethnicity mismatch, heavy brow ridge, harsh jawline`
- Sampler: `euler_a`, Scheduler: `sgm_uniform` (or `simple`), Steps: **18–20**, Guidance ~**3.5**.

**If you still see drift:** lower **model** to 0.60 and keep **clip** 1.05–1.10.

---

If you want, paste your current prompt + the two numbers you’re using for **strength_model** and **strength_clip**, and tell me whether it’s single or dual-subject. I’ll give you an exact pair to try that should stop the drift on the very next render.

**Robyn:**

Wow, I was doing the exact opposite (model: 1, clip .45). I'm trying this now. The two persons in the image are standing fairly close together, so I might lower the mask buffer (Blur Mask radius_x: 48) to like 38 or 32... whatever you suggest. Do you think that might help?

**Emily:**

You nailed the main flip: let **CLIP steer** and keep **UNet gentle**. That alone solves most drift. Now, because your two subjects are close together, the **mask feather** can cause identity “leakage.” Tightening it will help.

Here’s a clean, practical setup:

### LoRA strengths (per subject)
- **strength_model (UNet):** **0.60–0.70**  
- **strength_clip (CLIP):** **1.05–1.10**  
If one face still morphs, **lower that branch’s UNet** to **0.55–0.60** first; only then nudge CLIP up to **1.10–1.15**.

### Mask + feather (when subjects are close)
- Match mask size to **latent** (no auto-resize).  
- At **896×896** latent:
  - Try **Blur radius ≈ 32–38** (you were at 48; that’s generous and can bleed identities together).
- At **768×768** latent:
  - Use **Blur ≈ 24–32**.
- If edges look too sharp after reducing blur, add a **tiny dilate (2–4 px)** *before* the blur; this preserves a clean boundary without spill.

### Extra guardrails (use any that apply)
- **Zero overlap:** ensure the two masks don’t overlap a single pixel. If needed, erode each mask by **4–8 px**.
- **schedule_clip = false** on both SetClipHooks (stops per-step re-encoding drift).
- **Prompt hygiene:** trigger token **first** in each branch; avoid descriptors that imply a different ethnicity/hair unless intended.
- **Global negative (gentle):** `ethnicity mismatch, face merge, mismatched features, harsh jawline, heavy brow ridge`.

### Quick presets to try (copy the feel, not the UI)
**Preset A (safer, softer blend)**
- UNet **0.60**, CLIP **1.08**
- Blur **36 @ 896** (or **28 @ 768**)
- No overlap; masks eroded **6 px** before blur

**Preset B (stronger identity lock)**
- UNet **0.65**, CLIP **1.12**
- Blur **32 @ 896** (or **24 @ 768**)
- If drift appears on one side, drop that side’s UNet → **0.58**

If you want, tell me your current latent size and the two LoRA sliders you just used; I’ll give you an exact **radius + (erode, blur)** pair and slider pair tuned to that size so your next render holds both identities cleanly.

**Robyn:**

May I ask... before the 'Blur Radius (Fast)' node is a 'ThresholdMask' node... with a value of .50 (only dropdown in that node). Is that where the erode is meant to happen?

**Emily:**

Great question—short answer: **no**, the `ThresholdMask(0.50)` isn’t where erosion happens.

### What `ThresholdMask(0.50)` does
- It **binarises** your grayscale/alpha mask: values ≥ 0.5 → white (1.0), < 0.5 → black (0.0).
- It doesn’t shrink or grow the mask; it just snaps soft edges to hard edges.

### Where to do **erode / dilate**
You need a **separate morphology node** between `ThresholdMask` and `Blur`. Depending on your node packs, look for one of these:
- **Morphology** / **Binary Morphology** (operation: *erode*, *dilate*; iterations or pixels)
- **Mask Erode / Mask Dilate** (WAS Suite)
- **Grow/Shrink Mask**, **Expand/Contract Mask** (Impact/KJ/Fooocus packs)

### Recommended order (tight, clean edges for two close subjects)
```
[Mask source]
 → ThresholdMask(0.50)
 → Erode (shrink)      ← tighten boundary to stop identity bleed
 → (optional) Dilate   ← only if you need to re-round corners after a strong erode
 → Blur (feather)
 → (optional) Invert   ← only if your downstream expects inverted mask
 → Combine with conditioning
```

### Concrete settings (match to latent size)
For **896×896** latent:
- **Erode:** 4–8 px (or 1–2 iterations, depending on node)
- **Blur (fast):** radius **32–38**
For **768×768** latent:
- **Erode:** 4–6 px
- **Blur:** radius **24–32**

> Tip: If your morphology node uses **iterations** rather than pixels, start with **1 iteration**, preview, then try **2**.

### Why erode **before** blur?
- Erosion sets a crisp, slightly smaller boundary (prevents the other subject’s identity from bleeding in).
- The subsequent blur then feathers **outward** from that tighter edge, giving a natural seam without leakage.

### Two handy patterns
- **Just tighten edges:** `Threshold 0.50 → Erode 6 px → Blur 32`
- **Remove speckles (optional):** do an *open* (Erode 2 → Dilate 2) before the main Erode/Blur if your mask has tiny islands.

### Sanity checks
- Ensure the **mask resolution equals the latent** (no auto-resize).
- Preview the mask after each step (most packs have a Mask/Image preview node).
- Keep your **LoRA sliders** in the new regime (UNet ~0.60–0.70, CLIP ~1.05–1.10) while you tune edges.

If you tell me which morphology node you have available (exact node name), I’ll give you the exact knob names and values to dial in for your current **896×896** setup.

**Robyn:**

A side question, Emily: in Terminal, I keep seeing the comfyui error 

clip missing: ['text_projection.weight']

What is this?

**Emily:**

Not silly at all—this one spooks a lot of folks.  
`clip missing: ['text_projection.weight']` is a **state-dict mismatch warning**, not a hard error.

### What it means
- In some CLIP variants there’s a layer called `text_projection` that maps the text embedding to the shared image/text space.
- The **Flux** pipeline uses its own **CLIP-L** export (`clip_l.safetensors`) where that parameter is **omitted/merged/handled differently**.
- When ComfyUI (or DualCLIPLoader) loads a generic CLIP template and your file doesn’t contain that key, it prints:
  ```
  clip missing: ['text_projection.weight']
  ```
  …and proceeds with sane defaults. If your renders work, this message is harmless.

### When to worry
- If you also see lots of other missing keys, or text conditioning looks obviously broken (nonsense prompt behavior). Otherwise, you can ignore it.

### How to make it go away (or prevent issues)
1. **Use the Flux-matched encoders**
   - In `DualCLIPLoader`, set **Type = flux** and point to:
     - `clip_l.safetensors` (the one bundled/recommended for Flux)
     - `t5xxl_….safetensors` (fp16 or fp8_scaled)
   - Avoid mixing with unrelated OpenCLIP/OpenAI CLIP weights grabbed from elsewhere.

2. **Keep the pair consistent**
   - Don’t pair Flux UNet with SDXL’s CLIP-g/L encoders.
   - For SDXL graphs, use the SDXL CLIP pair; for Flux/SRPO, use the Flux pair.

3. **Update nodes**
   - Make sure ComfyUI and your CLIP loader nodes are up to date—older loaders were more chatty about “missing” optional keys.

4. **(Optional) Silence the noise**
   - Some builds have a “quiet/ignore mismatched keys” toggle in the loader; turning it on suppresses the log line.

### Bottom line
If your images are sampling fine and prompts behave, this line is **cosmetic**. Stick to the Flux CLIP files (`clip_l.safetensors` + your T5 file), keep `Type=flux`, and carry on.

**Robyn:**

Hm, baffling. When I had the model strength at .7 and the clip strength at 1, BOTH figures came out Asian. But when I swapped values (model: 1; clip: .7), neither came out even slightly Asian. The LoRA was obeyed.

**Emily:**

Not baffling at all once you think “two pipes”:  
- **CLIP pipe (strength_clip)** = semantic steering from text embeddings (trigger token + descriptors).  
- **UNet pipe (strength_model)** = the actual visual deltas your LoRA learned.

When you set **model 0.7 / clip 1.0**, you gave CLIP more say. If CLIP’s embedding space (T5-XXL+CLIP-L) has correlations that lean toward an “East-Asia-adjacent beauty cluster” for your phrasing/trigger, the **strong CLIP delta** can nudge both branches that way—even through masks.

When you flipped to **model 1.0 / clip 0.7**, you let the **LoRA’s UNet deltas dominate** and toned down the semantic shove. Result: the LoRA “wins,” identity stays put.

### Why CLIP can do that
- CLIP learns co-occurrence patterns. Certain adjectives, lighting words, hair/skin descriptors—even some generic portrait phrases—pull toward consistent clusters.  
- Two subjects share the **same base text encoder**, so a strong CLIP delta can bleed a common bias into both, even with separate masks.  
- Your trigger token’s CLIP-side delta (from training) might also carry subtle correlations.

### How to lock identity without overcooking
Pick one of these “profiles” and stick to it for A/B tests (fixed seed):

#### A) LoRA-led (most robust against drift)
- **strength_model (UNet):** 0.90–1.00  
- **strength_clip (CLIP):** 0.60–0.85  
- Keep **schedule_clip = false** on both branches.  
- Prompts: trigger token **first**, keep descriptors neutral.  
- Use gentle negatives: `face merge, mismatched features, harsh jawline, heavy brow ridge`.

This matches your “works” setting: CLIP can’t push you off identity, UNet carries the look.

#### B) Balanced (when you need text to matter)
- **strength_model:** 0.70–0.80  
- **strength_clip:** 0.85–1.00  
- Prune descriptors that imply a look you don’t want (hair/skin terms, certain “beauty” words).  
- If drift reappears, nudge **clip down** in 0.05 steps, or **model up** by 0.05.

### Dual-subject specifics (close spacing)
- Keep **zero mask overlap**; if needed, erode 4–8 px before blur, then **Blur** ≈ 32–38 at 896² (24–32 at 768²).  
- Make sure both masks are **exactly the latent size**.  
- If one side still drifts, lower **that side’s UNet** a bit (e.g., 0.85→0.75) and **raise its CLIP** slightly (0.70→0.80) so semantics anchor without overpowering.

### If you ever need an extra anchor (optional)
- Add a **very light FaceID/IP-Adapter** on the drifting side at **0.15–0.30**, same mask. Keep LoRA as primary. This gently recentres identity without repainting everything.

### Quick debugging loop
1) Fix seed.  
2) Start with **LoRA-led** profile.  
3) If faces look under-guided by text, step CLIP up (0.05), or step UNet down (0.05).  
4) If “Asian drift” returns, reverse that last step.

If you want, paste your two branch prompts plus the exact **model/clip** numbers you’re using, and I’ll hand you a tuned pair (and mask blur/erode numbers) for your current latent size so the next render holds both identities cleanly.
