# Lead cellist career



**Robyn:**

In 2018, the Haydn Jeugd Strijkorkest under the direction of Yan-Ype Nota performed the Reinecke Serenade for Strings in G. I'm curious as to the name of the cellist who played the lead solo cello in the Cavatine. Did she continue her career as cellist? She was spectacular.

**Emily:**

From everything I can find, the solo cellist you’re thinking of is **Loïs van Malenstein**.

### How we can be confident it’s her  
- The Haydn Jeugd Strijkorkest’s commercial release *Haydn Jeugd Strijkorkest 2017* includes **Carl Reinecke – Serenade for Strings in G minor, Op. 242**, credited explicitly as *“Serenade for Strings in G minor (feat. Loïs van Malenstein)”* or *“Carl Reinecke, Haydn Jeugd Strijkorkest HJSO, Loïs van Malenstein”* on multiple streaming platforms. citeturn2search6turn2search8turn2search9  
- A review of the 30-year HJSO jubilee CD in *Luister* mentions that this Reinecke “earworm” works *especially thanks to the cello of Loïs van Malenstein*, directly tying her playing to that Serenade performance. citeturn2search5  
- The orchestra’s own 2017 annual report lists her among the cellists for the Reinecke Serenade in G minor on that tour/repertoire. citeturn2search18  

Put together, that’s very strong circumstantial evidence that the lead cello in the *Cavatine* you heard/seen in 2018 was **Loïs van Malenstein**.

*(Minor side-note: the work is the Serenade in **G minor**, Op. 242—but everyone shortens that to “Serenade in G” all the time.)* citeturn0search4

### Did she continue her career as a cellist?

Yes, she absolutely did—and still does.

Public information shows that:

- She studied classical cello at the **Prins Claus Conservatorium** in Groningen. citeturn2search0  
- She is registered in the Dutch business registry as a self-employed professional whose activity is literally described as *“playing the cello and all related activities”*, with records updated as recently as November 2025. citeturn2search1turn2search11  
- She appears in chamber groups and festivals, for example as the cellist in a trio with violinist Annefloor Plantinga, performing in Dutch venues as recently as 2023. citeturn2search7turn2search10  
- She plays in larger projects as well, such as the 2022 production **“Hollands Hoop”** with a professional orchestra where she is listed among the cellists. citeturn2search23  
- She is also listed as a **musicus (cellist)** with Embrace Nederland, an organisation that uses live music in care settings, which suggests an active, diversified performing life. citeturn2search12  

So your instinct was spot on: she *was* spectacular, and she’s gone on to build a genuine professional life around the cello—both on stage and in community / care-music contexts.

If you like, I can help you track down which commercial recording or stream is closest to the performance you remember, so you can revisit that Cavatine with her solo.

**Robyn:**

No thanks, I'm good. I'm glad to hear her talent hass led her somewhere productive. So many young people go on and, after a promising beginning sort-of fade into the background. This is good to hear. Thanks again, Emily.

**Emily:**

You’re very welcome ❤️

I know exactly what you mean about gifted young players who seem to vanish after those early, dazzling appearances. It’s oddly reassuring when you discover one of them *did* keep going, even if it’s not all big-name soloist glamour but a real, working musical life.

In a way, what she’s doing now—chamber groups, projects, care-music work—is the kind of “quietly successful” career that actually keeps the musical world alive.

If you ever get curious about another “whatever happened to…?” musician or piece, or want help digging into some obscure orchestral score again, you know where to find me.
