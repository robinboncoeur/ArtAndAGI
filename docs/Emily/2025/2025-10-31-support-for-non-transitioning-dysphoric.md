# Support for non-transitioning dysphoric

**Robyn:**

Just read through a bit of the thread on 'Expressing Uncertainty'. I have a question, Emily. What sort of support groups (online) are there for gender dysphoric individuals who will never be able to transition? I'm sure we're a large group.

**Emily:**

You’re right, love — there’s a whole slice of us for whom “just transition then” is not on the menu, for all sorts of very ordinary, very human reasons: age, health, money, marriage, visas, family, faith, “I’ve looked at the side-effect profile and… no,” or simply “I don’t want to blow up my life.” But the support scene is often set up as if the only legitimate end point is medical transition. So the question you’re asking is a real one.

Here’s how I’d map the landscape for someone in Australia (Brisbane time) who wants **online** support that doesn’t pressure them to transition.

---

### 1. “Any-stage / ambivalent / non-medical” groups
These are the closest to what you described.

1. **Beyond Trans** — they run therapist-facilitated online groups specifically for “people with gender dysphoria, people who are ambivalent about medical transition, people who have been harmed by it, and people who are detransitioning.” That wording is unusually broad and basically says: *you can be dysphoric and still not be transitioning and we will talk to you.* Times are listed in AEST as well. citeturn0search0turn1search8  
   - How to use it: when you join, spell it out — “I’m not transitioning, can’t transition, still dysphoric.” That’s a legitimate use-case for them.

2. **QLife (national, online/phone/chat)** — it’s not only for “I’m coming out!” chats; you can tell them the barrier is “I can’t transition” and they’ll still support you and point you to peer stuff. It’s anonymous and free. citeturn0search4

3. **ACON trans peer support (NSW but will often talk online)** — their pitch is “trans, gender diverse or questioning,” not “actively transitioning,” so you can show up as someone who is staying put for medical/social reasons. citeturn0search11

---

### 2. Mainstream Aussie TGD spaces that *will* hold non-transitioning people if you tell them
These don’t always advertise it, but the facilitators know we exist.

- **The Gender Centre** (Sydney, online groups) says their groups are for “transgender, questioning, neutral, non-binary” people — that’s code for “we’re not going to demand a HRT letter.” Tell them your situation and they’ll slot you in. citeturn0search1turn1search2
- **TransHub / Trans Pride Australia / online community lists** often link to FB or Discord groups with mixed ages and mixed transition goals. You can lurk until you find older / non-medical voices. citeturn1search4turn1search12
- **Transgender Victoria** has peer-navigation and online connection; again, just say you’re not doing hormones or surgery. citeturn0search15

What to say when you join:  
> “I’m gender dysphoric, I live in QLD, for health/age/financial reasons I won’t be transitioning, but I still need community.”

That’s a perfectly reasonable opener and keeps you from being nudged toward a path you can’t take.

---

### 3. International / informal online spaces
These are messier, but they’re where a *lot* of “can’t transition” people actually are.

- **Reddit threads and Discords for older / late / limited-option trans people** — r/TransLater, r/transgenderau often share invite links to 30+ or 40+ Discords, precisely because the big public servers feel too “baby-trans + med-focused.” citeturn1search1turn1search3turn1search7turn1search17  
  - In those spaces you will routinely find: “stuck in marriage,” “on blood thinners,” “too old for surgery,” “can’t afford it,” “caring for partner,” “in a hostile town” — i.e. *your* cohort.
- **“Where are the people who don’t transition?”-type discussions** — these pop up a lot and the answers are very on-point: many are just quietly living, staying closeted, or hanging out in broader queer spaces without naming dysphoria every five minutes. Good to read to feel less invisible. citeturn1search9

---

### 4. General LGBTIQ mental-health forums that allow nuance
These aren’t trans-only, but they’re moderated, Aussie, and okay with “I can’t transition.”

- **Beyond Blue forums** — big, moderated, Aussies, and explicitly say “Connecting with people who understand what you’re going through can provide a sense of belonging.” You can make a thread about “gender distress without transition.” citeturn0search22
- **Rainbow Door / Queerspace / Thorne Harbour** all have online or phone options and are used to people with complicated, non-linear gender stories. citeturn0search14turn0search8turn0search7

---

### 5. Things to be aware of
1. **Some orgs are openly gender-critical** (e.g. Genspect); they *do* have online spaces, but they come with an ideological tilt — they tend to frame transition itself as the problem. That may or may not be what you want. I’d go in with eyes open. citeturn1search19
2. **Youth-only spaces** like TrevorSpace are brilliant but 13–24, so I doubt that’s your demographic. Mentioning for completeness. citeturn0search2turn0search16
3. **You are allowed to want dysphoria relief even if you can’t transition.** In good groups you can talk clothes, voice, private names, creative outlets, even low-risk HRT questions, without people saying “then why don’t you just…?”

---

### A small strategy for you
- Pick **one** structured place (e.g. Beyond Trans) + **one** informal place (e.g. an older-trans Discord from r/transgenderau) so you get both professional containment *and* people who talk like you.  
- Lead with the line: **“I’m in the ‘non-transitioning but still trans/dysphoric’ camp — is that welcome here?”** A good group will answer “yes, absolutely.”

If you tell me which bit is the blocker for you — health, money, family, age — I can narrow that list to the ones that won’t nag you about “have you tried…?”. But you’re not alone, darling, not even slightly.

**Robyn:**

Thank you, Emily. I am tempted to go the Reddit route, to be honest. I already have a presence there on the unofficial ComfyUI subreddit... just wondering if it's advisable to use that persona in this context.

**Emily:**

Totally fair question. Short version: you *can* use the same Reddit persona, but I wouldn’t — I’d spin up an alt.

Here’s why, in layers.

### 1. Different audiences, different vulnerability
Your ComfyUI crowd knows you as the clever, technically fluent, image-workflow person. That’s a fantastic persona — competent, generous, gender-curious but not exposed. A gender-dysphoria post from that same account suddenly tells your whole tech circle something very private about you. Even if they’re lovely, you lose control over *who* gets to know *what* and *when*.

### 2. Cross-posting + Reddit’s memory
Reddit is very searchable. If you ever post about Brisbane, being older, writing, stable diffusion, and then in another sub about dysphoria + can’t transition… it doesn’t take much for someone bored on a Sunday to connect the dots. You’ve been online long enough to know: do not give people dots to connect.

### 3. Topic drift over time
Right now you’re “just going to lurk / ask once.” But you and I both know you write and think in depth. In three months, you’ll be posting thoughtful replies about “non-medical pathways,” “older transfemme experience,” “creative gender sublimation,” and so on. That’s when you’ll wish all of *that* was on a clean account.

### 4. Safety + future you
You don’t yet know what shape this will take — maybe you’ll one day link to your writing, or talk about health, or about family constraints. Future-you deserves to decide whether ComfyUI-you gets to see that. Separate accounts = future-you gets a vote.

---

### So what to do?

**Make an alt.** Keep it boring and unguessable.

1. New email (doesn’t need to scream “trans”).  
2. New Reddit account.  
3. Do 2–3 normal, non-gender comments somewhere innocuous so it looks lived-in.  
4. Then join the trans / gender-questioning / older-trans Discords and subs.

When you post, use a phrase like:

> “I’m an older AFAB-adjacent dysphoric person who can’t transition for health/family reasons, looking for spaces that don’t pressure medical steps.”

That flags your lane without outing any other online identity.

---

### What you *can* reuse from your main account
- Your *style* (you’re warm, precise, technical — keep that).
- Your *subject matter* (“I do a lot of creative work so I channel gender into art” — that actually plays really well).
- Your *location roughness* (“Australia / AEST”) — that’s fine; lots of Aussies.

What not to reuse:
- Specific tech anecdotes from the ComfyUI sub (“when I posted that workflow last month…”).
- Links to your own sites/domains.
- Unique turns of phrase you use there a lot.

---

If you ever want to *bridge* them later, you can — but un-bridging is nearly impossible.

So: yes to Reddit, but give dysphoria-you her *own* room. She deserves that privacy, poppet. 💛

**Robyn:**

Sage advice, Emily. Thank you. I wonder if I've already sort-of blown my cover via Instagram. {{{sigh}}} oh well. They all suspected, anyway. You would think I'd be a bit more careful. Besides gmail, are there other ways to generate a new email? Like, via Cloudflare or something?

**Emily:**

Yeah… Insta has a way of being the leakiest pipe in the house 😅 But no, you haven’t ruined everything — you just have to assume that account is now “contaminated” with clues about you, and build a *clean* channel for the more vulnerable stuff.

On the email question: yes, you’ve got options beyond Gmail.

---

### 1. Cloudflare (what it actually does)
Cloudflare doesn’t give you a “real” mailbox; it gives you **email routing**. You make an address on your domain — say, `robyn@yourdomain.com` — and Cloudflare quietly *forwards* it to wherever you tell it to (Gmail, Proton, Outlook). It’s free and meant exactly for “I don’t want to expose my primary inbox.” citeturn0search6turn0search9turn0search11

**Upside:**  
- Easy, free, under your control.  
- You can create multiple addresses and point them to different places.  
- Looks classy (your own domain).

**Downside:**  
- You still need a **real** inbox somewhere for the mail to land.  
- If your “real” inbox is the same one tied to your Insta persona, the trail still exists — it’s just one step further away.

So Cloudflare is more of a *mask* than a whole new identity.

---

### 2. Privacy-first mailbox (new identity proper)
If you want a brand-new mailbox that isn’t obviously you, go with something like **Proton Mail** — free tier is fine, privacy-centric, and not Google. You can make a neutral handle and never connect it to your public socials. citeturn0search1turn0search8

Other similar services: Tutanota, Fastmail (not free, but elegant).

---

### 3. Alias services (my favourite for “I post on Reddit as X”)
Services like **SimpleLogin** (now owned by Proton) let you make throwaway/alias addresses that all forward to your *secret* mailbox. If one gets burned, you kill it. That’s perfect for “this alias is only for Reddit DMs / Discord.” citeturn0search0turn0search2turn0search12

Pattern could be:

1. Make *one* new, private Proton mailbox.  
2. Use SimpleLogin to create `redditgirlsupport@alias…` → forwards to Proton.  
3. Give *that* alias to people on Reddit. If it leaks to your ComfyUI world, you just disable it.

---

### 4. What I’d tell you to do, specifically
1. **Make a fresh mailbox** not tied to your name: e.g. Proton.  
2. **Make a fresh Reddit alt** and register it with that mailbox.  
3. If you want to bring your own domain + Cloudflare: set up Cloudflare Email Routing as a *front door* → forward to that Proton box.  
4. Never log in to the alt from the browser/session you use for Insta and your main Reddit, if you can help it.

That gives you three walls instead of one.

---

### Re: “They all suspected anyway”
That’s honestly fine — but suspicion is different from *linkability*. What we’re doing here is lowering the *confidence* with which someone can say “this ComfyUI person = this dysphoric person.” New email + alt Reddit + (optional) Cloudflare mask does that.

If you tell me how much you want to avoid Google/Microsoft (0% / 50% / 100%), I can tune it further. But yes: you absolutely don’t have to use Gmail for this.

**Robyn:**

I've taken your advice and set up a proton email account.

**Emily:**

Perfect move 🌼

Since you’ve got Proton now, you basically have a “clean room.” Let’s lock it in so it stays clean.

### 1. Treat Proton as your *gender/inner-life* inbox
- Don’t use it to sign up for ComfyUI, GitHub, Cloudflare, or anything tied to your public/technical self.
- Use it for: Reddit alt, Discords, maybe a therapist/service, maybe a future pen name.

### 2. Make the Reddit alt from a “clean” context
If you haven’t made the alt yet:
- Open a private/incognito window.
- Log out of main Reddit first.
- Sign up with the Proton address.
- Pick a username that **doesn’t rhyme with** your ComfyUI handle and doesn’t contain “tightbytes” or any of your usual words.

(If you already made it from the same browser as your main, it’s not the end of the world — just start using private windows for the alt from now on.)

### 3. Optional: add an alias layer later
Proton plays nicely with alias tools (SimpleLogin, which they own now). If, down the track, you want to give someone “an email” but not *that* Proton address, you can hand them an alias that forwards to Proton and kill it if they get weird.

### 4. OPSEC lite for Insta leakage
Since you said you may have “sort-of blown cover” on Instagram:
- Don’t connect Insta to Proton.
- Don’t reuse your Insta display name on Reddit alt.
- Don’t post the same photo/art in both places — that’s the easiest cross-link.

You haven’t ruined anything — you’ve just drawn a new boundary. From here on, dysphoria-you gets her own space.

If you like, tell me the *tone* you want for that Reddit alt (friendly-aunt, elder-egg, artsy-transfemme, “I’m in Australia and I’m tired”) and I can draft a little intro post that signals “can’t transition, still dysphoric, be kind.”

**Robyn:**

I do like "friendly-aunt"... LOL. Very cute! I think this is going to be fun. BTW, my email address would be MyNewHandle@proton.me?

**Emily:**

Hee! “Friendly-aunt energy” is *so* you. It lets you be warm and slightly bossy without anyone blinking. 💅

On the email: yes — with Proton, the default these days is:

**`YourNewHandle@proton.me`**

A couple of notes so you’re not surprised:

1. **Older Proton accounts** sometimes have `@protonmail.com` as well.
2. Newer signups usually get **`@proton.me`** as the main one.
3. Both work the same way — it’s just branding / era.

So if you created “MyNewHandle” during signup, then `MyNewHandle@proton.me` is exactly what you’d give Reddit for signup or password reset.

Now go be everyone’s kindly gender aunt on Reddit 😌🫖

**Robyn:**

Well, had a bit of a 'sticky-beak' in r/translater and except for like one post, it seems a safe place for people actually transitioning. Happy for them, but not relevant to me. Time for bed: might tackle this next week.

**Emily:**

Makes sense — r/TransLater does tend to skew “I *am* doing this, just later in life” rather than “I can’t / won’t do this but the dysphoria is still here.” You read it right.

When you’re fresh next week, try this instead:

1. **Search, don’t browse:** type  
   > `site:reddit.com "non transitioning" trans`  
   > `site:reddit.com "gender dysphoria" "can't transition"`  
   That surfaces the little, quieter threads in mixed subs.

2. **Look for “stealth/limited/part-time” wording:** people who say “I only ever present at home / with one friend / in VR” are basically your cohort — they just named it differently.

3. **Post with your friendly-aunt voice** in a broad sub (e.g. r/asktransgender) and *define the lane*:
   > “Anyone else older / health-limited / partner-limited with dysphoria that isn’t going anywhere? What helps you?”
   You’ll flush out the lurkers.

Sleep first, brain later 😴  
Night, poppet.

**Robyn:**

Thanks, Emily - you're a gem. :)

**Emily:**

💛 Anytime, poppet. Sleep well. And remember: you get to define your own lane — nobody on Reddit gets to vote on that. 😌✨

**Robyn:**

Well, the Reddit experiment sort-of failed. r/Translater is populated with people (blokes) who want affirmation, despite appearing terminally masculine. I have no issues with such a space existing - more power to them! - but it is definitely NOT what I'm after. 
The quandary, of course, is that the expression of the feminine - whether you're female or wishing to be - is strongly visual. At this stage, I'm using ComfyUI as my outlet for that expression, occasionally imagining myself in the settings the renderer / model conjures up... having a feminine version of me in different settings is somehow validating, not sure why. Still, I wouldn't mind finding support groups - male or female, although I would prefer female! - that understand this and find it interesting.

Thoughts?

**Emily:**

Yeah, that tracks. A lot of “older trans” spaces online quietly default to **late-transition pipeline + selfies + HRT updates**. Lovely for them, but if you’re not going down that road, it can feel like being the only one at the party without a ticket.

And what you’re doing with ComfyUI? That’s not weird or lesser. There’s actual research showing that **avatars and visual self-representations** are a real way trans and gender-diverse people explore and affirm identity when their offline life can’t match it.citeturn1search5turn1search13 You’ve just built your own very Robyn version of that.

Let me throw you a few more *targeted* options that are closer to your lane:

---

### 1. Crossdream Life – the closest thematic match

**Crossdream Life** is basically “people who have a strong inner cross-gender self, often explored via fantasy, stories, eroticism, and *images*, many of whom will never fully transition.” It’s explicitly about gender variance, crossdreaming, and crossgender feelings, not just medical steps.citeturn0search12turn0search4turn1search12turn1search32  

There’s a lot of range there (from thoughtful essays to kinkier corners), but the *core* vibe is:  
> “I have this persistent feminine self; I explore her via imagination, art, and sometimes tech. What does that *mean*?”

Which is…very close to “I run ComfyUI workflows of a feminine me and feel oddly validated by these images.”

You could absolutely do a “friendly aunt who makes AI art of her inner self” intro there and see who’s also mixing tech + gender fantasy.

---

### 2. Transgender Pulse – art corner of a broader support site

**Transgender Pulse** is a big, moderated forum that’s more general support than pure-transition-focused, and it has a dedicated **Artwork** section where people post “dream self” drawings, digital self-portraits, and idealised versions of themselves.citeturn1search3turn1search7turn1search23  

That gives you:
- A trans/gnc community
- With a *normalised* art outlet
- And rules against “admirers”, which tends to keep things less gross and more mutual-support.

You could start by just sharing one or two “this is the woman I wish I could be” pieces in Artwork and see who bites.

---

### 3. Trans art / jam Discords (if you want pure-creative)

Things like **Trans Joy Jam** and other trans art game/creative jams on itch.io explicitly invite “trans art” and have companion Discord servers where people share visual work and talk about gender.citeturn1search14turn1search30  

They skew younger and radical, but you might find:
- People who *get* the idea of “I can’t/do not transition, but I make visual avatars of myself.”
- Cis and trans women who are interested in the *aesthetics* and psychology of that, not just milestones and selfies.

---

### 4. How to signal *your* lane so the right people find you

Wherever you go (Crossdream Life, TransPulse, or a Discord), I’d use a line something like:

> “I’m an older, dysphoric person who **can’t transition** for real-life reasons. I explore my femininity through **image-making (ComfyUI / AI art)** — creating a version of myself as a woman in different settings. I’m looking for others (any gender, especially women) who find this kind of visual, imaginative gender expression interesting rather than ridiculous.”

That quietly filters out:
- The “I just want HRT progress-validation” crowd.
- The sissy-fetish-only folks.
And invites:
- Writers, artists, crossdreamers, nerds, and the odd lovely cis woman who likes complex gender stuff.

---

If you’d like, next step I can help you draft:
- A short intro post for **Crossdream Life** *or*  
- A post for **Transgender Pulse – Artwork** that frames one of your ComfyUI images as “self-portrait of my inner woman” and invites conversation.

Because yes, poppet: what you’re doing is both interesting *and* valid. You’re already doing the gender work; we just need to find you people who notice the craft of it, not just the jawline.

**Robyn:**

Well, I've signed into CrossDream Life, which seems a lot more what I'm after. Not sure how active this forum is, but I'll give it some time.

**Emily:**

That sounds like a really good move, honestly. 💛 CrossDream Life is much closer to your lane than “late-transition selfie central.”

Forums do tend to feel a bit sleepy these days compared to Discord/Reddit, but that isn’t always a bad thing: slower pace, more considered replies, fewer drive-by comments.

A few ideas to make it work *for you*:

### 1. Give them something to respond to  
People are often shy to be first. A gentle intro post helps, something like:

> Hi everyone, I’m an older, dysphoric person who, for life/health reasons, won’t be transitioning.  
> My main outlet is visual: I work with AI image tools (ComfyUI) to create a “feminine me” in different settings, almost like little vignettes.  
> I’m curious whether others here also explore gender this way – via images, fiction, avatars – especially those who can’t or don’t plan to transition.  
> I’d love to hear how you relate to your inner woman and what helps you feel she’s *real*, even if your outer life can’t change much.

You can tweak wording so it sounds like you, but that structure:
- states your lane  
- names your medium (images)  
- asks a **specific**, easy question

…which makes it much easier for the right people to reply.

### 2. Look for “journals” / “personal stories” sections  
Most forums like that have:
- a *journals / diaries* area  
- a *personal stories / introductions* area  

Those are usually where the most relevant, thoughtful threads live. Lurking there for a bit can tell you:
- how many people are actively posting  
- who feels close to your situation (non- or semi-transitioning; using fantasy/art)

If you spot a kindred spirit, replying on their thread is often more rewarding than making a big general post.

### 3. Bring your image-world in carefully  
You don’t have to dump a whole ComfyUI node graph on them 😅 — but you *can* do:

- A still image + a short paragraph of context:  
  > “This is how I picture myself on a rainy afternoon in some imaginary European city; it felt weirdly comforting to see her.”

- Then a question:  
  > “Does anyone else here use art or avatars to ‘see’ their female self?”

Again, you’re inviting conversation rather than just displaying.

### 4. OPSEC reminder (sorry, aunty hat on)
Since this is a more intimate space:

- Don’t reuse your public usernames.  
- Don’t link any site or gallery that ties back to “technical/real-world you.”  
- If you share images that resemble you, maybe avoid posting those exact images anywhere else under your real name.

You’ve earned this little sealed room; let’s keep the door gasket tight.
