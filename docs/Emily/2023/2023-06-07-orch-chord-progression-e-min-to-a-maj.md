**Emily:**

A good orchestral chord progression from E minor to A major could be as follows:

1. E minor (Em): E - G - B
2. E minor with added 7th (Em7): E - G - B - D
3. G major (G): G - B - D
4. G major with added 7th (G7): G - B - D - F
5. C major (C): C - E - G
6. A minor (Am): A - C - E
7. A major (A): A - C# - E

This progression takes you from the somber E minor tonality to the brighter A major tonality. The added 7th chords (Em7 and G7) add some tension and color to the progression. Keep in mind that this is just one example, and you can experiment with variations and additional chords to create your desired orchestral sound.

A common and effective chord progression to transition from E minor to A major in an orchestral setting is:

E minor - G major - C major - A major

This progression maintains a smooth and natural tonal movement while providing a sense of resolution and uplift when reaching the A major chord. Here's a breakdown of the progression:

1. E minor: The starting chord sets the tonal foundation and establishes the melancholic mood associated with E minor.

2. G major: Transitioning to the G major chord introduces a sense of brightness and serves as a stepping stone to the next chord.

3. C major: Moving to the C major chord continues the upward movement and prepares the listener for the final resolution to A major.

4. A major: The A major chord represents a joyful and triumphant resolution, creating a significant shift in tonality from the initial E minor.
