**An Easing Of Tone: looking at Scene 31**

[Q]  
Hi Emily. I'm just looking at Scene 31. Charli (now officially seen as 'she') and Celeste are at Wardrobe. The scene is written in omniscient POV... I'd rather see it in Celeste's, to be honest. I'm going to revise the scene a bit - it's about Charli's hair, which she isn't really managing properly. Be back in a bit with the full text to convert from omniscient to Celeste's POV, if you're happy to do that.

[A]
Absolutely — send it through when you’re ready and I’ll convert it cleanly into **Celeste’s POV**.

While you’re revising, here are a few “guardrails” that tend to make this particular conversion (omniscient → Celeste) land with the exact *easing-of-tone* you’re after, without going soft or losing Wardrobe’s standards:

### What we’ll keep, even as the tone eases

* **Wardrobe stays structured.** Warmth doesn’t mean “anything goes.” It means the same expectations, delivered with steadier hands.
* **Celeste stays the decisive centre.** She can be gentler while still being unmistakably in charge of the frame.
* **Charli stays ‘she’ socially.** Not as a debate—just as the room’s settled reality.

### What changes when we move into Celeste’s head

Omniscient often explains motives (“Charli wasn’t managing her hair because…”) whereas Celeste POV *notices* and *chooses an approach*.

So we’ll swap:

* **Explanation** → **observation + inference**
* **Global truth** → **Celeste’s judgment**
* **Narrator softness** → **earned warmth (competence-based)**

### Hair scene specifics that work beautifully in Celeste POV

This is an easy place to show *care as policy*.

Celeste can clock hair in three overlapping ways:

1. **Presentation:** hair affects silhouette, period read, and the atelier’s “standard”.
2. **Function:** hair affects work (pins slipping, sweating under caps, stray strands in stitches).
3. **Belonging:** hair care is one of those quietly intimate “you’re one of us” rituals—*but only once Charli meets it with compliance, not fuss.*

Celeste’s tone can be:

* “I’m not scolding you. I’m correcting the system.”
* “This isn’t vanity. It’s competence.”
* “You don’t get to be fragile about this. You get to learn it.”

### Quick checklist to help your revision before you paste it

If your current draft contains lines like these (typical omniscient markers), I’ll naturally reshape them:

* “Charli felt…” → Celeste sees a micro-signal and interprets it.
* “They all thought…” → Celeste notices a room shift (silence, glances, the way Mara doesn’t look up).
* “It was clear that…” → Celeste decides what’s clear and what she’ll do about it.

### When you send it, I’ll deliver:

* A full **Celeste POV rewrite** (keeping your events and dialogue intact unless smoothing is needed).
* Light **line-level tightening** where omniscient scaffolding is visible.
* A version that **eases the tone** without turning it sentimental.

Drop the text whenever you’re back. If you’ve got a particular *beat* you want to preserve (e.g., “Celeste corrects gently but unmistakably” vs “Celeste is dryly amused” vs “Celeste quietly protective”), I’ll pick it up from the writing itself and carry it through.

## Two Questions

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116an.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Two questions, here, Emily:
1) most of the scenes are written in past tense, with the exception of one in Charli's POV (special situation)... was there a reason you chose present tense when the original was in past tense?
2) I'm not real clear on what transpired between Celeste and Charli at this point:

“I corrected Tilly because she was two inches too close,” I say, matter-of-fact. “That was the rule. But the reason I felt it so sharply is… I’m not neutral.”
Charli’s shoulders go very still, as if her body has decided not to move until it knows the terms.
I finish the tie, tug it gently to check it will hold, and let my hand rest at the back of her neck for exactly one second—contact as brief and deliberate as a signature at the bottom of a contract.
Then I step away.
“I saw you,” I say—quietly. Not romantic. Not dramatic. Like a verdict.

What was Celeste saying? She had emotions for Charli? Not clear to me.

---

[A]
### 1) Why present tense?

No deep reason beyond **muscle memory from the conversion pass**: I slipped into present because your draft already has that *“this is happening right now in the room”* immediacy (the brush, the metronome sound, the micro-pauses). Present tense can make a “small ritual / boundary / consent” scene feel clinically immediate.

But: if the surrounding scenes are mostly **past tense**, then yes—**you should keep it past** for continuity unless you’re doing a deliberate “special situation” like Charli’s first-person pivot. Celeste’s voice doesn’t *need* present to carry authority.

If you want, I can flip the whole scene back to past tense in one clean pass (it’s mostly mechanical: *I say → I said, I stand → I stood,* etc., with a few rhythm tweaks so it doesn’t feel like a downgrade in intensity).

---

### 2) What is Celeste actually saying in that passage?

You’re reading it correctly: **the current wording is too elliptical**. The intent is *not* “romance declaration” and also *not* “I’m sexually interested.” It’s more precise than that:

Celeste is telling Charli:

* **My enforcement wasn’t just policy reflex.**
  The policy was the justification; the *sting* came from personal stake.

* **I’m invested in your safety and your place here.**
  “Not neutral” means: *you matter to me in a way I’ve been refusing to show, because I won’t behave like an entitled person claiming you.*

* **I’m done pretending I don’t have a stake, but I’m still going to handle it cleanly.**
  She’s naming her bias without asking Charli to manage it.

And then the line **“I saw you.”** is meant as a verdict of recognition:

* *I see what you are (alignment, not entitlement).*
* *I see what you’ve been doing (earning safety through usefulness).*
* *I see you as mine to protect within Wardrobe’s system — not as property, but as “under my lead, under my standard, under my care.”*

That’s why it’s paired with the *one-second contact* and the “signature on a contract” image: Celeste is **formalising** something internally and culturally, not making it romantic.

But I agree with you: on the page, it can read like, “I have Feelings™” without telling the reader *what kind*.

---

## Two quick fixes (pick the flavour you want)

### Option A — Keep it strictly professional/structural (no romance read)

Replace the unclear part with language that makes the “stake” explicit as **protective leadership**:

> “I corrected Tilly because she was two inches too close,” I said, matter-of-fact. “That was the rule. But I felt it so sharply because I’m not neutral about you being safe here.”
> Charli’s shoulders went very still.
> I finished the tie, checked it would hold, and let my hand rest at the back of her neck for exactly one second—contact as brief and deliberate as a signature. Then I stepped away.
> “I see you,” I said quietly. “I see what you’re doing. And you don’t have to buy your place with strain.”

Now “I see you” is clearly about **recognition + belonging**, not romance.

### Option B — Allow a controlled emotional admission (still not gushy)

If you *do* want it to carry a personal edge—without turning into a love confession—make the stake explicit as **attachment + restraint**:

> “I corrected Tilly because she was two inches too close,” I said. “That was the rule. But I’m telling you the truth: I’m not neutral where you’re concerned.”
> Charli went still.
> I finished the tie and stepped back.
> “I’ve been pretending I don’t care,” I said, voice low and exact. “I do. I’m just not going to handle it like a person who gets entitled.”

That pins down “not neutral” as **care + disciplined boundaries**.

---

## Why Charli freezes there

That little stillness is Charli thinking: *What are the terms? Am I safe? Am I about to be claimed? Am I about to be made responsible for her feelings?*

So Celeste has to answer—cleanly—without burdening her. That’s why clarifying language helps.

---

If you tell me which reading you want (A: purely structural, B: personal but controlled), I’ll rewrite just that mini-section so the intent is unmistakable **and** then I can convert the entire scene back into past tense to match the rest of your manuscript.

## Hopeless Romantic

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260116ao.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Call me a *hopeless romantic* but, oh, I so like Option B better. Of course, poor Charli had best not get her hopes up yet... but yes, as Celeste is the one at the helm, she can safely (without anything underhanded) express to Charli she has feelings for her. Let's not forget that it was MORE than apparent Charlie (the boy) was instantly smitten with her. That was incontrovertible. The TERMS of their relationship she will manage because, she's the wiser one, the one in better control (as the episode with the anti-androgens proved). So, those terms will continue, going forth. To be honest, as the Scenes progress, I think it would be delightful to have her take the role of the suitor, only because she does hold the reins, so it only makes sense. And Charli, for her part, already smitten, will naturally fall into the role of the one being courted. Does that make sense to you, Emily?

---

It makes perfect sense — and it’s *clean*, narratively, because it doesn’t require Celeste to do anything slippery. She can be the suitor **openly**, with standards, with consent, with terms that protect Charli from the “am I being used / am I being tested / am I being claimed” panic.

The delicious part is: **Celeste courting doesn’t have to look like flowers.** In Wardrobe, courtship looks like *governance* and *care-as-structure*: she offers security, clarity, and inclusion — and Charli, already smitten (first as Charlie, then increasingly as Charli), gets to be the one who is chosen *without being hunted*.

So yes: Celeste as the suitor, Charli as the courted — while still keeping the power dynamic ethical — is exactly the right flavour for this arc.

### What “Celeste as suitor” looks like in your world (and why it works)

Celeste’s courting behaviours can be:

* **Named, not implied.** “I’m not neutral” becomes “I’m interested” *with boundaries intact*.
* **Offer-based, not take-based.** She offers terms, space, care, and time — Charli opts in, repeatedly.
* **Competence-coded.** Courtship is: “I will keep you safe in the system. I will make you legible. I will not let others mishandle you. I will not let *you* mishandle yourself.”
* **Slow heat.** She doesn’t “pounce.” She sets a steady pressure gradient: small bids, consistent follow-through.

Charli’s role stays believable because:

* She’s already emotionally primed (smitten, easily impressed by Celeste’s certainty).
* She’s soothed by **clarity**. The terms reduce her anxiety.
* She *likes* being led when the leadership is fair and predictable.

### The “terms” Celeste manages (so Charli doesn’t get hurt)

Celeste can make a quiet protocol for herself (and sometimes say it aloud):

1. **No ambiguity that forces Charli to guess.**
2. **No emotional labour required from Charli.** Celeste owns her feelings; Charli isn’t made responsible for them.
3. **No intimacy as leverage.** Care is not payment, and affection isn’t currency.
4. **Public boundaries stay firm.** Even if she’s courting, she doesn’t let the room become a theatre.

That’s why this can feel romantic without being messy. It’s romance as *stewardship*.

---

## Let’s implement Option B inside your scene (tight, unambiguous, still Wardrobe-clean)

Here’s a revised version of that key passage, in **past tense** (to match your larger manuscript), and with Celeste’s meaning unmistakable:

> “I corrected Tilly because she was two inches too close,” I said, matter-of-fact. “That was the rule.”
> Charli’s shoulders went very still.
> I finished the tie at her nape, checked it would hold, and let my hand rest there for exactly one second—contact as brief and deliberate as a signature. Then I stepped away.
>
> “But I’m telling you the truth,” I went on. “I’m not neutral where you’re concerned.”
>
> Her breath caught. She didn’t turn—like turning might make it real before she knew the terms.
>
> “I’ve been pretending I don’t care,” I said, voice low and exact. “I do. And I’m not going to handle it like a person who gets entitled.”
>
> I let the next line be clean, because clean was kinder than poetry.
>
> “I see you,” I said. “And you don’t have to earn care here.”

That keeps:

* the *contract-signature* metaphor
* the firmness
* the absence of manipulation
* the romantic charge (because she admits care and refuses entitlement)

…and it also answers your question “what was Celeste saying?” with no fog.

---

## How to make the ongoing “Celeste courts Charli” arc feel *delightful*

A few concrete moves you can sprinkle across later scenes:

* **The first “date” is a task.** Celeste creates a reason that’s real: sourcing, fittings, a museum visit, a supplier meeting. It’s legitimate… and also courtship.
* **She gives Charli a name that is a claim without being ownership.** Not “pet,” not “baby.” Something Wardrobe-fluent: “my girl” *only once it’s earned and welcomed*, or a French phrasing that is tender but not cutesy.
* **She escalates with permissions.** “May I?” becomes her signature. Charli learns she can say no and remain safe — which makes yes meaningful.
* **She makes Charli legible to others.** Not by announcing anything, but by adjusting culture: who stands where, who speaks first, who is “with” whom.
* **She courts in public by protecting standards, not by touching.** Everyone sees it, but it never becomes gossip because it never becomes sloppy.

Charli, being courted, gets to:

* glow quietly
* be a little stunned
* comply with happiness
* struggle not to hope too fast
  …and Celeste notices all of it, and manages it responsibly.

---

If you want, I’ll do two things next, in one go, no questions asked:

1. Convert the entire scene into **past tense**, preserving the intensity.
2. Thread this **Option B “not neutral”** moment through the rest so the emotional logic stays continuous (so it doesn’t feel like a sudden confession out of nowhere, but rather a controlled pivot).

Just say the word.
