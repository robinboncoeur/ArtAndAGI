# Notes 11-Jan-2026


## Scene 24

Got it. This is *very* close to publish-ready already — the power geometry is crisp, the “standards not sentiments” texture is there, and the ladder feels like something Mara would invent because it’s both clinical and weirdly kind (kind in the only way she does it: **by making competence attainable**).

Below is a tight, story-facing pass: what’s working, what I’d tweak, then a clean copy-edit you can lift as-is (or cannibalise).

---

## What’s already working (and why it reads “Second Rung”)

### 1) Mara’s authority is procedural, not performative

She doesn’t “promote” him. She changes the conditions and watches. That’s perfect for rung two.

### 2) The test is *real* and not melodramatic

“Someone speaks to you while you work. You keep your hands.”
It’s workplace-real (distraction tolerance), Wardrobe-real (precision under pressure), and thematically real (control of self under the gaze). Nice.

### 3) Sarah as “voice” is good casting

She’s not cruel enough to be a villain, but she *is* sharp enough to expose weak joints. That’s exactly what rung two needs: pressure that isn’t violent, just relentless.

### 4) Lauren’s coaching is correct: warm, firm, no rescue

She’s not shielding him from consequences; she’s teaching him how to meet them.

### 5) Celeste’s POV is present without “explaining”

You let Celeste’s internal reading of the room do the power work (especially near the end with the map/road line). That’s the right kind of dominance: quiet, directional.

---

## Tweaks I’d make (small, but they’ll sharpen the scene)

### A) Trim a few “authorial” sentences that slightly step out of Celeste

Lines like:

* “That was the most grown-up thing he’d said in the room.”
* “There it was: the beginning of a fantasy…”

They’re *good*, but they read a touch “omniscient narrator.” If you tilt them a hair more into Celeste’s voice, it stays anchored and feels more intimate.

### B) Make “keep your hands” mean two things (without spelling it)

Right now it mainly signals: don’t fidget / don’t self-soothe / don’t lose control.

A micro-beat from Celeste can make it also mean: **don’t make your body someone else’s problem** (no male-pattern discomfort management). You can do it in one line, and it will intensify the Wardrobe ethos without turning the scene into a lecture.

### C) The ledger entry is *almost* too neat

“rung two completed” is borderline “training module completed.” Mara’s ledger would be more like: *met standard / observed / repeat until boring*. She wouldn’t certify it like a scout badge — she’d log it like a defect test.

### D) The chalk “proof” beat is excellent — make it even quieter

The “putting the chalk down properly” moment is one of the best in the scene. I’d keep it, but remove any hint that the narrative is pointing at it. Let it sit like an unremarked victory — that’s more Mara, and it’s more satisfying.

### E) Repetition: keep it, but make it surgical

“Colleague” works as a stitch standard. You’ve done that well. I’d just make sure Sarah’s “edge returns” moment doesn’t feel like it violates the rule too much — better if she *nearly* slips, then corrects. That shows *she* is being trained too.

## Copy-edited Scene 17 (clean text, minimal but meaningful changes)

### Scene 17 — “Second Rung” (Celeste POV)

Mara didn’t announce the second rung like it was a milestone. She treated it like a seam finish.

“Today,” she said, “someone speaks to you while you work. You keep your hands.”

Charlie’s eyes flicked to the ledger as if the page might explain what that meant in muscle terms. His shoulders rose a fraction. Mara tapped the table once.

“No shoulders.”

He dropped them a little too fast — like a boy caught. Mara didn’t correct the speed. She corrected the premise.

“Not wrong,” she said. “Just unnecessary.”

Yesterday’s mock-up lay folded at the end of the cutting table — no longer the centre of attention, which was its own kind of relief. Today’s work was smaller and meaner in its simplicity: chalk lines, notch marks, grainline checks. Things you could do perfectly until a voice arrived and reminded you you were a person being witnessed.

Mara looked at Sarah.

“You wanted front-facing,” Mara said. “You’re the voice.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened. “Me.”

“Yes,” Mara replied, already moving on. “Not as punishment. As training. Speak like a colleague.”

Sarah tipped her chin, as if she’d never been asked to do anything in her life except tolerate it.

“Fine.”

Lauren set her tote down and pulled out a packet of labels — the kind used for tagging bolts and marking stock. Practical. Quiet. She didn’t insert herself into Mara’s authority. She simply made herself useful in a way that softened the air without changing the rules.

Charlie stood at the cutting table with chalk in hand, pattern pinned, his attention narrowed to the line. He’d learned, in three days, that the safest place for him was inside a task.

Mara’s finger hovered over the pattern piece.

“Waistline. Then the hip-spring marks. Clean.”

He nodded and began. The chalk whispered. The line appeared. Ordinary. Safe.

Sarah leaned against a shelf, arms folded.

“You look like you’re defusing a bomb,” she said.

Charlie’s chalk hesitated — a small white stutter in the line.

Mara’s voice landed without volume.

“Colleague.”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “Fine. You’re working like you’re defusing a bomb.”

Charlie’s fingers tightened. He tried to move the chalk again and the line wobbled — only a millimetre, but enough that he saw it. His breath sharpened, as if the room had narrowed.

Lauren stepped closer. Not to rescue or crowd. Her voice stayed low, meant for Charlie, not for an audience.

“Short answers,” she said. “Factual ones. Then back to the line.”

Charlie blinked at her. Lauren’s expression was warm but firm — a coach who refuses drama because she respects the athlete.

“You don’t have to be clever,” she added. “You just have to stay in the work.”

Mara didn’t look at either of them, which was how she approved things: by not interrupting them.

Sarah pushed off the shelf.

“All right,” she said, and this time her tone shifted — less spectator, more shop-floor. “Why are you marking that notch before the grainline?”

Charlie’s chalk paused again — then steadied, as if the question had given him somewhere rational to stand.

“Because the notch is a reference point,” he said quietly. “The grainline’s easier once the reference is anchored.”

He didn’t look up. He didn’t smile. He didn’t apologise for speaking. He answered, then kept drawing.

Lauren’s mouth twitched.

“That,” she murmured, not quite to anyone, “is the whole trick.”

Sarah watched his hand for a beat, her expression changing in small increments: annoyance, then reluctant interest.

“And if you mark it wrong?”

Charlie’s chalk moved.

“Then we’ll know,” he said. “Because it won’t match the block.”

Sarah’s lips parted — almost personal. Mara cut it clean.

“Colleague.”

Sarah exhaled through her nose.

“Right. If it doesn’t match the block, it doesn’t match the block.”

Charlie made the last waistline mark and set the chalk down properly — not clutched, not held like a weapon. Just placed. Then he reached for it again.

Mara stepped in.

“Again,” she said, sliding the next piece toward him. “Same task. Same voice.”

Charlie swallowed and nodded.

Sarah circled to the other side of the table, forcing him to exist at a different angle of attention.

“Does it bother you,” she asked — and the edge nearly returned — “that all this is… seen?”

His chalk faltered for one heartbeat.

Lauren’s instruction came back like it was written on the table.

*Short answers. Factual ones. Back to the line.*

“It used to,” he said. “Now it’s… data.”

Sarah’s brow lifted. “Data.”

Charlie drew.

“If I can’t do the work while someone talks,” he said, “I can’t do the work.”

Mara’s eyes flicked up once, then down again. A microscopic nod — the closest she came to approval.

Sarah’s mouth tightened, and for a moment I saw her deciding what kind of person she wanted to be in this room.

She chose — grudgingly — correct.

“All right,” she said. “Then I’ll give you something useful.”

Charlie didn’t look up. “Okay.”

Sarah pointed. “Your line’s drifting a hair at the side-back.”

Charlie stopped. Looked. Adjusted.

“Thank you,” he said, still not looking at her.

He corrected the drift and continued.

Lauren let out a breath that was almost laughter — private, pleased.

“See?” she said softly. “Learnable.”

Mara reached for the ledger and wrote while Charlie worked. Not as theatre. As record. When she was done she pushed the book toward him.

**R2 — EXPOSURE:** spoken to while working; hands maintained; answers factual; no retreat. **Repeat until boring.**

Charlie stared at the sentence as if it had weight. Then — without being prompted — he added his own note beneath it, smaller, neater:

**NOTES:** first question shook me. second question steadied me. answered and kept moving.

He underlined *kept moving* once.

Sarah glanced at the underline, then at Mara.

“That’s it?” she asked, half-challenging.

Mara didn’t bother looking up.

“That’s it,” she said. “Until it’s boring.”

Lauren slid a label across the table toward me. **STAYS BLOCK — RETURNING-TO-WORK**, it read in tidy print.

“We’re going to need a proper storage system for these,” Lauren said, conversational, warm. “You can’t build a business on paper scraps and hope.”

Mara made a sound that was almost agreement.

“A business,” Charlie repeated under his breath, as if the word had slipped in unnoticed.

I watched him — just for a second — watching the templates, the ledger, the labels. A new shape forming behind his eyes: not romance. Not rescue. Structure. Continuity. The kind of thing you could hold up with boring reliability.

I didn’t look like someone waiting to be held up. I looked like someone reading a map and deciding where the road would go.

Mara tapped the table once.

“Third rung next.”

Charlie blinked. “What’s third?”

Mara’s voice stayed flat.

“Someone says something stupid,” she replied. “You keep your hands.”

Sarah smiled without warmth.

“Oh,” she said. “I can help with that.”

Lauren’s smile was warmer, and sharper.

“Colleague,” she reminded Sarah — lightly, for her.

Sarah’s smile tightened.

“Colleague,” she echoed.

Charlie picked up his chalk again.

Not bravely.

Just… as if work was what you did next.

---

## Optional “one-line” upgrade if you want Celeste’s dominance to bite a touch more

Right after Mara’s first “keep your hands,” you can add:

> In Wardrobe, “hands” meant more than fingers. It meant: don’t make your nervous system everybody else’s problem.

That’s all it takes to make the rule feel like *women’s workplace culture enforced* rather than “a quirky training exercise.”

If you want, paste Scene 18 (or just its opening) and I’ll make sure rung three lands like a genuine escalation rather than a punchline — because “someone says something stupid” can be hilarious, but it can also be a *real* test of whether Charlie has stopped reflexively performing masculinity when provoked.
