# Scene Drafts Request

**Robyn:**

## Alternate Summary

Hi Emily. I've made some changes to our summary. First off, I do like this Direction (E) the best... but with a few modifications: 

### Direction E — The feminine self becomes explicit (I want it to)

I've decided the story truly needs “a strong feminine to be released,” do it in a way that stays respectful but also, realistic:

**How to keep it clean**

* No “tests,” no coercion, no “gotcha.”
* Things are framed as **comfort, consent, and function**, never spectacle. Sharl isn't putting on a show.
* The outward changes are incremental, chosen (by him), and done under supervision (medical + social boundaries). [1] 

**Key beats**

* Sharl articulates the distinction: “I don’t hate men. I hate contempt. And I feel calmer when I’m not being pushed into masculinity.”
* He chooses a name/term privately (even if not shared publicly).
* Celeste’s role is not to “make” him; it’s to offer a stable environment where he can **name himself**.

[1] He knows in his heart of hearts he doesn't want anything reversing. As he settles into his new life, he feels happier than he's ever felt. Why would he want this reversing?


### My Own Feelings where Things Should Go Now

I am basing this on a direction I would have chosen for myself, given the opportunity. However, this direction slowly becomes apparent as aspects of some of the other directions you suggested have either been tried and failed, or done and succeeded. For example:

* He finds he likes rituals: skincare as triage, hair as function, clothes as silhouette harmony.
* He is highly protective, increasingly so, of other women’s boundaries (without saviourism): e.g., calmly intervenes when any male shows entitled behaviour. Not as a "setting the standards" male would: as a woman protecting another woman would. He's in a role now: he can't flip back and forth. And, to be honest, he has no practice nor examples of what that would look like. On the other hand, he has lots of examples of women protecting women and adopts their approach. Makes sense.
* He starts choosing softness intentionally (voice, posture, habits) because it eases his nervous system.
* This shift in approach leads Sarah to give him a nickname that IS gendered but also affectionate and inclusive, and it sticks. Happened to me: it was very validating.
* A male hire fails culture. Sharl is the one who calmly enforces boundaries, proving he’s not “trying to be a woman”—he’s being the standard. The new male hire doesn't last more than a couple of days: Mara sees to that.

All of these advance the cause: Sharl embraces his new self, unconsciously and un-self-consciously. 

### Where Sharl Advances

#### Background

Most importantly: it is quite obvious to all of Wardrobe that Sharl is falling in love with Celeste, even if he cannot admit it to himself or her. He has come to realisethat she appreciates him MOST when he meets her standards... which is very different to the typical bloke standard. He actively tries little touches to acknowledge and meet those standards. He does little things to himself in hopes she will notice (she does). His mannerisms soften further around her. None of this is eros-based: it is pure care focused. He goes "next-level" to make her life as complete and satisfying as only a caring (female) spouse would do.

How does Celeste respond to her secret wishes coming true? He is explicitly tailoring himself to being appealing *to her*: she knows this is what he is doing. He think she's unaware... because he doesn't realise women always know (he's still young, remember). She realises the direction their relationship has taken has strong potential for being misread. 

#### Three scenes

So, in the next scene, I'd like to see her discuss this with Lauren. She confesses having "feelings" for Sharl and her realisation that giving those feelings free rein might interfere with her work and her studies. Lauren is increasingly protective of Celeste. She doesn't understand the dynamics of her and Sharl's relationship, but she does see Sharl becoming "softer/gentler" around Celeste at work. She expresses her puzzlement at his behaviour to Celeste who inexplicably defends it. Pondering this and with a few more clues from Celeste, she finally "gets it". 

In a subsequent scene, she has an appointment (alone at first) with the psychiatrist and endocrinologist, where she reveals her findings. Both professionals agree that as Sharl has finally been allowed to express himself the way he feels the most at ease and true to himself, that his dysphoria is less "abhorrence to being masculinised" and more a true classic gender dysphoria. Estradiol is mentioned but nothing is prescribed. Sharl needs to be on board.

In the next scene, Lauren goes back to Celeste with her findings. Celeste is relieved that the direction she hoped would be the most uplifting for Sharl was the one the professionals agreed with her on.


That's the direction the story should go, in my opinion, Emily.

**Emily:**

Yes. This is coherent, ethically clean, and (crucially) *dramatically useful* because it lets the femininity emerge as **competence + calm + chosen alignment** rather than “plot device.”

What I especially like about your revision is the triangulation:

- **Sharl** is the subject of his own identity (choice, language, pace).
- **Celeste** is the environment and standard (she doesn’t manufacture him; she makes it safe to be real).
- **Lauren** is the protective adult witness (she doesn’t meddle; she makes sure nobody turns this into workplace theatre or a moral panic).

Below are the three scenes you asked for, laid out as **scene purpose → conflict → turning beats → key dialogue options**, with a clean, respectful tone and with the women remaining decisively “at the helm.”

---

## Scene 1 — Celeste tells Lauren the truth (and Lauren finally “gets it”)

### Purpose
Celeste admits: she has feelings, she’s noticed Sharl tailoring himself to her standard, and she’s aware how easily that could be misread. She isn’t asking permission. She’s **setting guardrails**.

### Setting
After-hours at Wardrobe. The day’s heat has leeched out of the building. The workroom smells faintly of steam, fabric sizing, and that metallic note from scissors that have been sharpened too often.

### The conflict
Lauren arrives ready to talk “duty of care.” Celeste meets her with something deeper: *“I’m in control of this. I’m also not stupid.”* Lauren’s protective instincts flare… and then shift, as she realizes this isn’t flirtation; it’s **orientation toward safety**.

### The beats
1. **Lauren’s observation:** “He changes around you.”
2. **Celeste’s defensive reflex:** not gushy, not coy—measured, slightly irritated at the *implication*.
3. **Celeste’s admission:** feelings exist; she has clocked his “softening”; it’s not erotic performance, it’s care-seeking and care-giving.
4. **Lauren’s puzzle piece:** she asks the one question that matters: “Is he doing it to be seen as *good*… or because it makes him calmer?”
5. **Celeste’s answer:** “Calmer. And better. And he doesn’t know I can tell.”
6. **Lauren’s “get it” moment:** she stops trying to interpret him as a boy behaving oddly, and starts interpreting him as a young woman-ish person finding their posture.

### Dialogue spine (you can lift this nearly as-is)
Lauren: “It’s not subtle, Celeste. He goes… quieter. Like he’s waiting for your weather report before he decides what day it is.”  
Celeste (dry): “He doesn’t need my permission to exist.”  
Lauren: “That’s not what I meant.”  
Celeste: “It *is* what everyone means, eventually.”  

(Beat. Celeste puts something away with unnecessary precision—classic her.)

Celeste: “I’m telling you because I’m not letting this become gossip. Or a project. Or a morality play.”  
Lauren: “So what is it?”  
Celeste: “It’s… direction. He likes my standard. He tries to meet it. And when he does, he looks like he can breathe.”  
Lauren: “And you?”  
Celeste: “I’m not letting my personal life eat my work. I’m also not going to pretend I’m indifferent.”

Lauren: “Is he—” (she hesitates, chooses the least stupid words) “—is he doing it *for you*?”  
Celeste: “He thinks he is.”  
Lauren: “And you think…?”  
Celeste: “I think he’s doing it because it’s the first time in his life it’s worked.”

(That’s Lauren’s shift: she stops seeing “a boy trying to please” and starts seeing “a person aligning with self.”)

Lauren: “Okay. Then we do this properly.”  
Celeste: “We do this *quietly*. And with boundaries.”

### Celeste’s strength in this scene
She doesn’t blush. She doesn’t apologise. She doesn’t ask Lauren what she’s “allowed” to feel. She simply acknowledges reality and **sets terms**.

---

## Scene 2 — Lauren meets the psychiatrist + endo (professionals agree on shape, but won’t leap ahead)

### Purpose
Lauren seeks clinical framing—not to override Sharl, but to prevent harm: no rushing, no workplace coercion, no amateur diagnosing. The clinicians validate the *pattern* Lauren describes while being appropriately cautious: they won’t “diagnose by proxy,” and they won’t prescribe anything without Sharl’s direct participation.

### The conflict
Lauren is used to being the competent adult in the room. Here she’s in a clinical environment where competence looks like restraint. She has to sit with: *“You can’t solve this for him.”*

### The beats
1. Lauren presents observations: relief when not pushed into masculinity; consistent preference for softness/ritual; distress at masculinising pressure; a stable increase in wellbeing with feminine-coded choices.
2. Psychiatrist clarifies distinctions (without making it a lecture): dysphoria can be about distress from masculinisation *and* about positive alignment with femininity. The key is **persistence, consistency, and the person’s own narrative**.
3. Endocrinologist is practical: hormones are not a “next step,” they’re one possible tool—**only if Sharl wants it**, after informed consent and mental health support are in place.
4. They both emphasize: the *first* step is meeting Sharl, hearing *his* language, and ensuring no one is pressuring him (including well-meaning women at work).
5. They agree with Celeste’s approach indirectly: stable environment, low spectacle, autonomy.

### Dialogue spine
Psychiatrist: “I’m glad you came. But I’ll say this plainly: I can’t diagnose someone I haven’t met.”  
Lauren: “I’m not asking you to. I’m asking what I’m looking at, before someone else decides it’s a joke.”  
Psychiatrist: “Good. Because the joke is usually the violence.”

Lauren (controlled): “He’s… happier. Softer. Calmer. And the moment anyone drags him toward ‘be a man’ he goes dim.”  
Psychiatrist: “That could be many things. Trauma response, anxiety, social pressure. Or it could be gender dysphoria. The differentiator is *how he describes himself*—and whether the relief is merely escape, or *alignment*.”

Endocrinologist: “And to be clear—estradiol is not something we ‘mention’ like a hint.”  
Lauren: “I didn’t come for hints.”  
Endocrinologist: “Good. It’s a medical intervention with permanent effects. Some people want it. Some don’t. The ethical line is not ‘could it help,’ it’s ‘does the patient want it, understand it, and have support.’”

Psychiatrist: “If what you’re describing is persistent and consistent—and if he experiences wellbeing when he lives in a more feminine mode—then yes, classic gender dysphoria is on the table. But it’s his table.”  
Lauren: “Fine. I just needed to hear I’m not imagining the pattern.”  
Psychiatrist: “You’re not. And you’re doing the right thing by not turning it into a crusade.”

### Lauren’s strength in this scene
She is **not** performatively tender. She’s disciplined. She respects process. She’s protective without stealing agency.

---

## Scene 3 — Lauren reports back; Celeste is relieved, but she keeps the power where it belongs

### Purpose
Celeste gets confirmation that her “hopeful” direction is clinically plausible—*but* she is reminded: nothing moves unless Sharl moves. The relief is real; the control remains ethical.

### The conflict
Celeste has private wishes. She also has ambition, a reputation, and a young person in her orbit who trusts her. She must hold all three without slipping into “I know what’s best.”

### The beats
1. Lauren delivers the framing, not a verdict.
2. Celeste’s relief shows, but she immediately asks the *right* question: “How do we keep it clean?”
3. Lauren gives operational rules: confidentiality, no workplace pressure, no gossip, no “teaching moments,” no letting staff treat him as a mascot.
4. Celeste decides how to invite Sharl into the conversation: not a confrontation, not a pitch—an **offer**.
5. End hook: Celeste watches Sharl in the workroom afterwards—doing something small and perfect (ritual competence), and she realizes: he’s already halfway there. He just hasn’t said it out loud.

### Dialogue spine
Lauren: “They won’t label him without meeting him. But—yes. The pattern fits. Not ‘I hate men’—more like ‘I can’t tolerate being pushed into masculinity.’ And the relief he gets isn’t pretend.”  
Celeste (a quiet exhale): “Good.”  
Lauren: “Not ‘good’ as in ‘we’re right.’ Good as in ‘we don’t have to doubt our eyes.’”

Celeste: “So what’s the next step?”  
Lauren: “The next step is *asking him what he wants*, and making sure he can answer without feeling like he’s auditioning for you.”  
Celeste (immediately): “He isn’t.”  
Lauren: “He is. A little. He’s young. And you’re… you.”  
Celeste (accepts it, no ego): “Fine. Then we build it so he doesn’t have to.”

Lauren: “And no one at Wardrobe gets to treat this as content.”  
Celeste: “If anyone tries, they can leave.”  
Lauren: “Including if *you* try.”  
Celeste (a thin smile): “I told you I wanted boundaries.”

Lauren: “Invite him to speak to them. No pressure. No timeline. No assumptions.”  
Celeste: “I can do that.”

### Celeste’s strength in this scene
She doesn’t need to be praised for being “supportive.” She is simply decisive: protect the environment, protect Sharl’s autonomy, keep the workplace culture clean, and keep her own feelings on a leash until he has language.

---

## Two micro-scenes you can weave between these (to make the arc feel inevitable)

### A) Sarah’s nickname lands (validating, inclusive, not a joke)
Sarah, catching Sharl doing something quietly feminine-coded (hair pinned back, sleeves rolled with neatness, hands clean, calm voice), says it *casually*, like it’s already normal.

Sarah: “Good girl. That’s it—steady hands.”  
Sharl freezes for half a second—then keeps going, because correcting her would cost him something he doesn’t want to lose.  
Sarah (without looking up): “If you’re going to pretend it didn’t feel nice, love, I’ll call you *sir* all week. Choose.”

That’s Sarah: affectionate, acerbic, and she makes it safe by making it **ordinary**.

### B) The new male hire fails culture (and the women enforce it, with Sharl backing the standard)
The bloke gets entitled—too familiar, too loud, “just joking,” ignores instructions.

Mara doesn’t argue. She removes him.

Mara: “You’re not a fit.”  
Bloke: “For what? I haven’t even—”  
Mara: “For being told once.”

And Sharl, standing slightly behind Mara, doesn’t puff up. He doesn’t posture. He simply stays aligned with the women’s boundary like it’s gravity.

That’s the point: he’s not doing “male heroics.” He’s doing **female solidarity**—quiet, unromantic, unshakeable.

---

## What Celeste’s *inner* response should be (the secret wish, handled cleanly)
She feels it—*the uncanny rightness*—but she interprets it as **stability**, not conquest.

- Relief, because the world finally makes sense: Sharl isn’t “mysterious”; he’s consistent.
- A flicker of fear, because she knows how fast people will accuse her of influence.
- A colder, sharper resolve: *“Then I will be unimpeachable.”*

Celeste doesn’t swoon. She **tightens process**.

That, in your story’s moral architecture, is exactly how a powerful young woman behaves when she realises she wants something: she doesn’t lunge—she builds a structure where consent can be real.

---

If you’d like, I can now draft these three as full prose scenes in your preferred cadence (Celeste-forward, crisp subtext, sensory detail, minimal exposition), with the women’s competence network clearly visible and Sharl’s emerging femininity framed exactly as you’ve set it: comfort, consent, function—no spectacle.

**Robyn:**

Yes, please.

**Emily:**

Absolutely. Here are the three scenes as full prose drafts, in the clean, consent-forward tone you set—Celeste primarily driving the moral architecture, Lauren acting as the competent adult witness, and Sharl’s shift reading as **alignment** rather than performance.

---

## Scene One — “No Gossip, No Project” (Celeste POV)

Wardrobe after hours was a different building.

By day it was a machine: steam, voices, feet on timber, scissors biting through cloth with that soft, confident snick. By night it went still in a way that felt intentional, as if the worktables were holding their breath until morning.

I didn’t turn on all the lights. I never did. I left the room in its half-lit honesty—the tall lamps over the cutting table, the small task light by the machine, the rest in shadow. Enough to see clean lines. Not enough to invite drama.

Lauren arrived the way she always arrived: not rushing, not apologising for taking up space, not asking permission from a room she’d paid rent in a hundred times over by being the only adult in some situations. Canvas tote on her shoulder. Keys in her hand. That calm, measured face that said *I have already decided what matters.*

She looked past me, into the workroom, as if Sharl might be hiding behind a dress form.

“He’s gone?” she asked.

“Home,” I said. “I made sure.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched—approval, disguised as neutrality. “Good.”

She came in and set her tote on a chair without moving anything else. Lauren never disrupted a system. She noted it, learned it, worked around it.

Then she finally looked at me properly.

“It’s not subtle,” she said.

I didn’t pretend not to know what she meant. “Lauren.”

“No.” She lifted her hand, palm out—not a shush, not a scold. A halt sign. “Let me finish. It’s not subtle, and it’s not nothing. He changes around you.”

The words weren’t accusatory, not exactly. But there was an edge to them, the way there was always an edge when someone was about to say *I’m worried you’re not seeing what you’re doing.*

My first impulse was irritation. Not at her. At the universe. At how quickly anything tender got interpreted as manipulation the moment a girl was the centre of it.

“He doesn’t need my permission to exist,” I said.

Lauren’s gaze didn’t wobble. “That’s not what I said.”

“It’s what people mean.” I moved to the cutting table and picked up the chalk that had been left out. I didn’t need it. I just needed my hands occupied, because otherwise my face would give me away. “Eventually. They always land there.”

Lauren walked a few steps farther in, stopping beside the table like she belonged there—because she did. “Alright,” she said quietly. “Then say it plain. What’s going on?”

I set the chalk down with more precision than necessary.

“I’m telling you,” I said, “because I’m not letting this become gossip.”

Lauren’s expression softened by a fraction. “Okay.”

“And I’m not letting it become a project.”

Her eyebrows rose. “Whose project?”

“Anyone’s. Even yours. Especially mine.” I exhaled, slow. “I can feel the room gearing up for a narrative. And if it turns into a narrative, Sharl will get flattened under it.”

Lauren didn’t argue. She waited. That was one of her gifts: she could go still and make space without turning it into a performance.

I said, “He’s… oriented toward my standard.”

Lauren’s mouth opened as if to speak, then closed again. She tried another angle. “What does that mean, in English?”

“It means he watches me,” I said, “and he adjusts.”

“Because he likes you?”

I glanced up at her. “Don’t be simplistic.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed—not offended, just sharpening focus. “Then don’t be vague.”

Fair.

“He thinks he’s doing it for me,” I said. “Little things. How he stands. How he speaks. How careful he is. Like he’s trying to be the version of himself that won’t disappoint me.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked toward the doorway that led to the staff room, to the world where other people would take those words and turn them into something uglier. “And is he?”

I didn’t answer immediately. I considered the truth, the way it behaved in my mouth.

“I think,” I said slowly, “he’s doing it because it works.”

Lauren stared at me.

I continued, because once I’d started, stopping would be cowardice. “He’s calmer. He’s… steadier. He moves through the day like his nervous system isn’t being dragged by the throat.”

Lauren’s shoulders shifted, a subtle change—less suspicion, more understanding. “So it’s not… theatre.”

“No.” The word came out flat. “He isn’t putting on a show. He’s… finding an equilibrium.”

Lauren’s face did that thing it did when she was piecing together a pattern. “And you.”

I didn’t like how softly she said it. Like she was careful not to spook me.

“I have feelings,” I said. I made myself say it without flinching, without dressing it up. “That’s not the point. The point is that I’m not going to let those feelings set the terms.”

Lauren’s stare held. “Whose terms do you want?”

“His,” I said, immediately. “And ours. The workplace. The culture. The standards that keep people safe.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed on mine for a long moment. “Celeste,” she said, “do you understand how easily this gets misread?”

“Yes.” I didn’t even have to think. “That’s why I’m talking to you.”

Lauren nodded once, almost imperceptibly. “Good.”

I turned my head slightly, listening without meaning to. The building’s old pipes made soft ticking noises as they cooled. Somewhere outside, a car passed on wet asphalt. Quiet. Ordinary. Nothing dramatic.

Lauren said, “So let me ask you the only question that matters.”

I looked at her.

“Is he doing it,” she said, “because he wants to be seen as good… or because it makes him feel like himself?”

My chest tightened—because that was it. That was the dividing line, and she’d found it without being told.

“He looks like he can breathe,” I said.

Lauren’s face shifted again, and this time it was unmistakable. She got it. Not in a sentimental way. In a structural way. Like a load-bearing beam had been moved into place.

“Okay,” she said quietly. “Then we do this properly.”

“We do this quietly,” I corrected.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Quietly,” she agreed. “And with boundaries.”

I nodded. “And no one gets to treat him like content.”

Lauren’s gaze sharpened. “Including you.”

That would have been an insult from anyone else.

From Lauren, it was respect.

“I’m not stupid,” I said.

“I know,” she said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I let myself look away for a second, toward the dress forms lined up in the half-light—silent bodies waiting for meaning.

“He doesn’t know I can tell,” I said.

Lauren’s voice softened. “Of course he doesn’t.”

I frowned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

“It means,” Lauren said, “he’s young. And you’re a girl who notices everything. He thinks he can tuck his heart under his sleeve and you won’t see the shape of it.”

My throat tightened again, but I refused to let it become softness.

“So what do we do?” I asked. “Operationally.”

Lauren exhaled. “I’m going to speak to someone,” she said. “Professionally. Not to diagnose him without him. To get a framing. To make sure we don’t accidentally harm him by doing the wrong right thing.”

I studied her. “And you’re going alone.”

Lauren nodded. “Yes. Because if you go, it becomes your story. And it can’t.”

I didn’t like how correct that was.

“Fine,” I said. “Go.”

Lauren reached for her keys again, then paused. “And Celeste?”

“Yes.”

“If your feelings are real,” she said carefully, “you’ll prove it by not taking anything from him that he hasn’t offered.”

My jaw tightened. “I don’t take.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Good. Keep it that way.”

When she left, the door clicked shut with a quiet finality that felt like a vow.

I stayed where I was, in the half-lit workroom, and I did the only thing that ever calmed me: I straightened what didn’t need straightening, made the world tidy, made the boundaries visible.

Because if Sharl was going to name himself, he needed space to do it.

And I—whatever I wanted—was not going to be the reason he couldn’t.

---

## Scene Two — “It’s His Table” (Lauren POV)

The waiting room smelled like disinfectant and old carpet and the faint sweetness of those cheap air fresheners that tried too hard.

Lauren hated waiting rooms. Not because of nerves—she didn’t do nerves, not in public—but because waiting rooms were designed to make adults feel small. Low chairs. Too-bright lighting. Posters that spoke to you like you were twelve.

She sat anyway. Upright. Hands folded. Still.

When her name was called, she stood with the same calm she used when walking into a meeting where someone had underestimated her. The receptionist smiled at her in that automatic way. Lauren returned a smaller smile—polite, not inviting.

The psychiatrist’s office was clean in a deliberate way: calm colours, minimal clutter, books arranged to suggest both warmth and authority. The psychiatrist—Dr. Voss—stood to greet her. Middle-aged. Clear-eyed. The kind of person who didn’t waste empathy on performance.

“Ms. Rossignol?” Dr. Voss said.

“Lauren,” she replied, and took the offered seat.

Dr. Voss didn’t begin with a lecture. “Tell me what brings you in.”

Lauren kept her language simple. Not because the psychiatrist needed simple, but because this wasn’t a story.

“I’m here about a young person,” she said. “Eighteen. Works in a female-dominant workplace with strong culture. He’s… changing. And the workplace is at risk of turning that into gossip or pressure. I’m trying to prevent harm.”

Dr. Voss nodded slowly. “You’re not the patient.”

“No,” Lauren said. “And I’m not asking you to diagnose him without him.”

“Good.” Dr. Voss’s voice was crisp. “Then what are you asking?”

“A framing,” Lauren said. “A way to understand what I’m seeing, so I can keep the adults around him from being idiots.”

Dr. Voss’s mouth twitched—approval, disguised as neutrality. “Alright. What are you seeing?”

Lauren chose her words like she chose stitches: functional, clean, no fraying edges.

“He becomes calmer when he’s not being pushed into masculinity,” she said. “Not just socially. In his whole body. Voice, posture, habits. He’s drawn to rituals—skincare, hair, clothing—like they regulate him. He’s increasingly protective of women’s boundaries. Not as a man performing chivalry—more like he’s adopting women’s way of protecting women. Quiet. Consequential.”

Dr. Voss listened without interrupting.

Lauren continued, “And when a man—any man—shows entitlement, he has this… immediate reaction. He doesn’t puff up. He doesn’t posture. He just goes still, and he enforces the boundary in the same language the women do. Like he’s been waiting his whole life to speak that dialect.”

Dr. Voss leaned back slightly. “And what distresses him?”

“Being treated as ‘a bloke’ who should toughen up,” Lauren said. “Any pressure to be more masculine makes him… dim. Withdrawn. Unwell.” She paused. “He’s happier than I’ve ever seen him, lately. And he’s terrified of losing it.”

Dr. Voss’s gaze stayed steady. “Has he used any language about gender?”

Lauren answered honestly. “Not publicly. Not to me.”

Dr. Voss nodded. “And that matters.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “I know.”

Dr. Voss folded their hands. “There are multiple possible explanations for what you’re describing,” they said. “Anxiety response. Trauma history. Relief from social pressure. Or gender dysphoria—specifically, dysphoria around masculinisation, and/or euphoria around femininity.”

Lauren felt a familiar impatience. Not at the psychiatrist—at the world’s habit of complicating what was often painfully clear.

“So how do you tell?” Lauren asked.

Dr. Voss didn’t flinch from the directness. “You don’t tell,” they said. “He tells. The differentiator is his narrative, in his own words, over time. Persistence. Consistency. The sense of alignment versus mere escape.”

Lauren’s hands stayed folded, but her fingers pressed together. “It doesn’t feel like escape,” she said. “It feels like… arriving.”

Dr. Voss’s expression softened, just slightly. “That is a meaningful observation. But it remains an observation.”

Lauren inhaled slowly, steadying. “I’m trying to keep the workplace from pushing him,” she said. “Even in a supportive direction.”

“Good,” Dr. Voss said. “Because pressure is pressure, no matter how pretty the wrapping is.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Exactly.”

Dr. Voss reached for a note pad but didn’t write much. “If he wants to explore this clinically, he needs to come himself,” they said. “And he needs to know he can say ‘no’ without consequences.”

Lauren nodded. “That’s the culture we’re trying to protect.”

Dr. Voss stood. “There’s another professional I’d like you to speak with,” they said. “Not for prescribing anything now. For informed framing.”

The endocrinologist was in an adjacent office, more medical, less cosy, but equally calm. Dr. Singh greeted Lauren with a brisk professionalism.

“You’re not the patient,” Dr. Singh said after Lauren explained the situation.

“No,” Lauren replied. “And I’m not here to shop for hormones.”

“Excellent,” Dr. Singh said, like Lauren had just passed a basic test of decency.

Lauren laid out the same observations again, in the same careful language. Dr. Singh listened, then nodded.

“People bring up estradiol like it’s a suggestion,” Dr. Singh said. “A hint. A nudge. I don’t do hints.”

Lauren’s eyes didn’t move. “Neither do I.”

Dr. Singh’s mouth twitched. “Good. Estradiol is a medical intervention. Some effects are reversible, many are not, and the timeline varies. It is not prescribed as a reward for fitting a narrative. It’s used when a patient wants it, understands it, and is supported medically and psychologically.”

Lauren held that line in her mind like a rail. *Patient wants it.*

“What I’m describing,” Lauren said, “does it fit classic dysphoria?”

Dr. Singh glanced at Dr. Voss, then back to Lauren. “What you’re describing fits a pattern we see,” Dr. Singh said carefully. “But the diagnosis isn’t made by proxy. The ethical line is consent and agency. If he is consistently more well when expressing femininity, and consistently distressed by masculinising pressure, then yes—gender dysphoria is a possibility. But it is his body. His identity. His choice.”

Dr. Voss added, “It’s his table.”

Lauren felt the tension in her chest ease—not into comfort, but into clarity.

“So the right next step,” Lauren said, “is to invite him to speak to you. No pitch. No plan.”

Dr. Voss nodded. “Yes.”

“And to keep the workplace clean,” Lauren said.

Dr. Singh’s eyes sharpened. “Yes.”

Lauren stood. “Thank you.”

As she left, she felt the familiar weight settle in her hands—responsibility, not drama. The kind that didn’t make you a hero. The kind that made you boring and reliable.

She preferred it that way.

## Scene Three — “The Offer” (Celeste POV)

Lauren came back the next day with rain in her hair and purpose in her eyes.

She didn’t sit straight away. She stood in my doorway like she needed me to understand something before she could put her bag down.

“Well?” I asked.

Lauren’s face was composed, but there was a small, undeniable loosening around the mouth. Relief. Not the soft kind. The competent kind.

“They won’t diagnose him without him,” Lauren said.

“Good,” I replied, and meant it.

Lauren took one step in. “But yes, Celeste. The pattern fits. Not in a neat, storybook way. In a clinical, boring way.”

Something in my chest unclenched so suddenly it almost made me dizzy. I didn’t let it show.

“Say it properly,” I said, because I needed language I could build with.

Lauren nodded. “They said what we’re seeing could be anxiety or trauma or social relief,” she said. “But the consistency matters. The fact that he’s not just escaping masculinity—he’s aligning with femininity. That’s… significant.”

I studied Lauren’s face, looking for any sign she was dressing it up to soothe me.

There wasn’t any.

“And estradiol?” I asked, carefully.

Lauren’s gaze sharpened immediately. “Mentioned,” she said. “Not as a suggestion. As a tool. And they were very clear: nothing happens unless Sharl wants it, understands it, and asks for it himself. No hints. No nudges.”

A wave of something hot moved through me—vindication, yes, but also a cold fear that flickered right behind it.

Because if professionals could see the shape of this, then so could idiots. And idiots never handled a girl’s power with grace.

“What do we do,” I asked, “to keep it clean?”

Lauren’s shoulders eased. That was the question she wanted from me. Not *what do we do next*, but *how do we do it without harming him*.

“We keep it private,” Lauren said. “We keep it boring. We keep it choice-driven.” She counted on her fingers, like she was laying down policy.

“One: No workplace conversations about his gender. Not as speculation, not as celebration, not as jokes. If anyone asks, the answer is ‘that’s not our business.’”

“Done,” I said.

“Two: No ‘supportive’ pressure. No ‘you’d look so pretty’ nonsense. No making him the mascot of anyone’s enlightenment.”

My mouth tightened. “Anyone who tries can leave.”

Lauren nodded once. “Three: If you talk to him, you talk to him as his supervisor and as his friend—but not as someone who wants something from him.”

Heat rose in my face, sharp with irritation. “I don’t take from people.”

Lauren didn’t blink. “Then prove it.”

I hated how much I respected her for saying that.

Lauren continued, “You offer him information and a path. You don’t interpret him. You don’t label him. You don’t steer him toward a conclusion because it comforts you.”

My jaw tightened. “Fine.”

Lauren’s voice softened by a fraction. “Celeste.”

I looked at her.

“I know what you want,” Lauren said. “And I’m not judging you. But if your feelings are real, you will make it safe for him to say ‘no’ to you.”

The words hit like a hand on my sternum—firm, corrective, necessary.

I held Lauren’s gaze. “I can do that.”

Lauren finally set her tote down. “Good.”

A beat of quiet settled between us, filled only by the hum of the building waking up: a distant kettle click, a door latch, the soft thud of someone arriving early.

Lauren said, “Invite him to meet them. Or don’t. But give him the option.”

I nodded slowly. “I’ll do it my way.”

Lauren’s eyebrows rose. “Which is?”

“Quiet,” I said. “No confrontation. No big sit-down like I’m staging a confession. I’ll catch him when he’s stable. When he’s in his rituals.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “You mean when he’s calm.”

“Yes,” I said. “When he’s himself.”

Lauren leaned against the table and exhaled. “Then do it.”

I stood, and for a moment I didn’t move. I listened.

Footsteps. Light voices. The day beginning.

Then, through the open doorway, I saw him.

Sharl came in carrying a garment bag like it contained something sacred. He moved with that careful competence he’d grown into—shoulders not hunched, not puffed. Neutral. Ready.

His hair was pinned back cleanly, not because it was fashionable, but because it was practical. Sleeves rolled the same way the girls rolled theirs: tidy, purposeful. Hands clean. Nails short.

He didn’t see me at first. He went straight to the sink, washed his hands—thorough, unhurried—then dried them with the same methodical care.

A ritual. A triage. A nervous system soothed.

Lauren followed my gaze, and her expression softened again—not sentimental, just… human.

“He’s already halfway there,” Lauren murmured.

I swallowed. “Yes.”

Sharl turned then and noticed me. His face shifted—just slightly—into that softer mode Lauren had clocked. He didn’t grin. He didn’t flirt. He simply looked… attentive, like my approval was weather.

“Morning,” he said, voice low and gentle.

“Morning,” I replied.

His eyes flicked to Lauren, then back to me. He waited, polite. Obedient in the way he’d become obedient—by choice, not by fear.

I walked toward him, stopping at a respectful distance. Close enough to talk privately. Far enough to keep it clean.

“Sharl,” I said, “I want to offer you something.”

His brow furrowed slightly. “Offer?”

“Information,” I said. “And an option.”

Lauren stayed back. Silent. Present, but not looming.

Sharl’s throat bobbed. “Okay.”

I kept my voice even. “You’ve been doing well,” I said. “Not just at work. In yourself.”

He went very still.

I continued before he could misinterpret it as praise with strings attached. “I’m not asking you to explain anything to me,” I said. “And I’m not assuming anything about you.”

His eyes flickered—relief, so quick I might have imagined it if I hadn’t been watching him for weeks.

“But,” I said, “Lauren spoke to professionals. A psychiatrist and an endocrinologist. Not about you behind your back in a gossip way. In a duty-of-care way. To make sure we don’t accidentally do harm.”

His mouth opened, then closed. He swallowed again, and I could see the impulse to apologise—male habit—rise and then stall.

I didn’t let it land.

“They’re available to speak to you,” I said. “If you want. No pressure. No timeline. No requirement. It’s simply… an open door.”

Sharl’s eyes went glassy for a second, not with tears, but with that overwhelmed brightness of someone who has been quietly wishing for permission to consider themselves real.

He glanced at Lauren, then back to me. “You… you’re not—”

“No,” I said firmly. “I’m not pushing you. I’m not asking you to become anything. I’m offering you the option to talk, in a safe setting, if you choose.”

He breathed out, shaky.

And then—this mattered—he nodded once. Small. Decisive.

“I think,” he said, voice barely above a whisper, “I’d like that.”

I held my expression steady, like a professional, like a friend, like a girl who refused to turn his moment into her victory.

“Alright,” I said. “Then we’ll arrange it. Quietly.”

His shoulders loosened, a fraction. He looked, suddenly, like someone whose body had been bracing for years and had finally been told it could put the weight down.

Lauren stepped forward only then, just enough to be heard.

“You’re in charge of this,” she said to him, calm as law. “Not us. You.”

Sharl’s eyes flicked to her, and he nodded again—this time with more certainty.

“I know,” he said. And his voice, for the first time, didn’t sound like a boy trying to be brave.

It sounded like someone beginning to speak as themselves.

---

If you want, the next thing I can do is write the **follow-on micro-scene** where Sarah’s gendered nickname lands *casually and validatingly* (and Sharl doesn’t correct it), OR the **male hire fails culture** scene where Mara removes him in three sentences and Sharl backs the women’s boundary without a drop of “male hero” energy.

**Robyn:**

Thank you, Emily. I'll make the necessary mini-adjustments, such as the visit to the psychiatrist was a re-visit: he'd already been there once with Lauren, whereupon he recieved the diagnosis "dysphoria based on fear of masculinisation". And the endocrinologist was a woman in her 40s who, after careful consideration of all the facts, put him on anti-androgens, if you recall. I can do this, if you wish to write the follow-on micro-scene with Sarah. I'm just giving you what I intend to change in order to share the context with you. It's not a criticism.

**Emily:**

Not taken as criticism at all — those are exactly the kind of continuity calibrations that make the arc feel *inevitable* rather than “convenient.”

And yes, I remember the shape you’re steering back toward:

- **Re-visit** with the psychiatrist (so this isn’t a sudden epiphany, it’s a tightening of an already-known thread).
- **Female endocrinologist (40s)** who is measured, clinical, and—after weighing everything—puts him on **anti-androgens** (which reads as cautious, reversible-first, and aligned with “comfort + function,” not spectacle).

With that in mind, here’s the follow-on micro-scene with Sarah. I’ve written it so it *lands* as validating without feeling like anyone is “trying a word on him,” and so the power stays where it belongs: Sarah sets the tone, Sharl is allowed to receive it, Celeste notices without grabbing the moment.

---

## Micro-scene — “Good Girl” (Workroom, morning)

The workroom was already warm with the day’s first rhythm—kettle click, the whisper of an iron waking, the small, satisfying thud of fabric being laid flat like a promise.

Sharl arrived early again.

Not because anyone asked him to, and not because he was trying to be impressive. It had become one of his quiet rituals: arrive before the room could look at him, let his body settle before the noise arrived, begin the day inside something orderly.

He hung his bag on the same hook. He washed his hands the same way: palms, backs, between fingers, nails. Thorough. Unhurried. The kind of care that looked almost old-fashioned in a modern workplace—like he’d learned it from women who didn’t have time to be dramatic about competence.

When he turned, Sarah was already there, perched on a high stool with one knee up, sipping tea as if it was a job requirement. She had that UK accent that could make even kindness sound like a warning.

She watched him with open amusement, not cruel, not indulgent. Just… *seeing.*

“You’re in early,” she said.

“So are you,” he replied, mild.

Sarah’s mouth tipped. “I’m always early. It’s how I remain ungovernable.”

He did that small half-smile he did now—quicker than before, less guarded. He crossed to the cutting table and began laying out a length of fabric Mara had left tagged for him: a troublesome bodice panel that wanted to twist when it shouldn’t.

He pinned it down. Smoothed it. Checked the grain.

Sarah leaned forward, elbows on knees. “You’ve got the hands for this,” she observed. “Not the big clompy ‘I’m-helping’ hands. The *actually useful* kind.”

He didn’t answer at first. Praise used to land on him like a demand: *now be that forever.* These days it landed more gently, like information.

“I’m just being careful,” he said.

Sarah snorted. “That’s what being competent looks like, love. People call it ‘careful’ when it comes in a soft package.”

He swallowed, not disagreeing.

He reached for the chalk and marked a line, then re-marked it a millimetre over—correcting himself without fuss. His movements had a softness now that wasn’t performative. It was economical. It spared him.

As he bent closer, a loose tendril of hair slipped forward near his cheek. Without thinking, he tucked it back and secured it with the small clip he kept in his pocket—practical, neat, unselfconscious.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to it.

Not in a *gotcha* way.

In a *there you are* way.

“Good girl,” she said, completely casually, as if she were commenting on the weather. “That’s it. Keep it steady.”

The words hit him like a warm drop of water on a tense nerve.

He froze—just for the length of a breath. The chalk hovered above the fabric. His body, as if it had been trained for years to correct and apologise, tried to stand up and say something—*I’m not—*

But nothing came out.

Because he didn’t want to lose what the words did inside him.

He lowered the chalk and continued the line, hands suddenly very precise, as if his fingertips had been reminded they were allowed to exist.

Sarah took a sip of tea, unbothered.

A beat later, as if she’d only just remembered she was meant to be difficult, she added without looking up, “If you’re going to pretend it didn’t feel nice, I can call you *sir* all week. And you can watch your nervous system crawl out of your skin.”

His mouth parted, then closed.

She finally glanced up at him, eyes bright with wicked affection. “Choose.”

He stared at the fabric like it contained the answer written in thread.

His throat tightened. He wasn’t used to being offered choices that didn’t come with punishment.

“I—” he began, and the sound came out too small.

Sarah didn’t pounce on it. She didn’t “encourage.” She didn’t coo. She just waited, perfectly steady, the way some women could wait—like they had all the time in the world and weren’t afraid of silence.

Sharl swallowed and tried again.

“Don’t call me *sir*,” he managed.

Sarah’s grin flickered—approval, not triumph. “There we are.”

He let out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. It came with the tiniest tremor—almost a shiver, except he refused to let it become visible. He kept working. Kept his hands moving.

“Alright,” Sarah said, returning to her tea as if nothing important had happened. “Then that’s settled.”

As she spoke, Celeste walked through the doorway at the back—silent as she always was when she entered a room she considered hers.

She didn’t interrupt. She didn’t look directly at him. She hung her jacket, scanned the workbench, took in the pinned fabric, the neat line, the way his shoulders sat lower than they had a minute ago.

Her gaze flicked to Sarah—one quick check-in that wasn’t gratitude and wasn’t permission. It was assessment.

Sarah lifted her teacup in a tiny salute, as if to say, *I didn’t break him. I normalised him.*

Celeste’s mouth softened by the smallest fraction.

Not a smile. Not a claim.

Just recognition.

Sharl, still bent over the work, felt that recognition like warmth at the edge of his awareness.

He didn’t turn around to chase it.

He didn’t need to.

For once, the room didn’t ask him to be a boy who deserved kindness.

It simply let him be good at what he was doing—soft hands, steady line, a body finally allowed to settle into itself.

And that, more than any speech, made him feel safe.

---

If you want an alternate version where Sarah’s nickname is **less overt than “good girl”** (e.g., “love,” “darling,” “pet,” “my girl” used once and then dropped), I can write that too — but the one above is designed to land exactly as you described: *gendered, affectionate, inclusive, validating… and ordinary enough that it doesn’t become a “moment” the workplace fetishises.*

**Robyn:**

You did it exactly right, Emily. Sensitive, but also, bringing some light to Sharl about himself. He isn't being pushed anywhere. He's been shown windows into his mind and doors he can explore, all with the support of his work colleagues. What's not to like about this: it's perfect.

**Emily:**

I’m really glad it landed the way you intended — because the “light” here isn’t a spotlight aimed at him. It’s a lamp turned on in a hallway he’s already been walking, so he can finally see where the doors actually are.

And you’ve nailed the ethics of it: the women around him aren’t *steering* him, they’re building a workplace where his truth isn’t punished, mocked, or turned into content. That’s the dream, frankly — not “acceptance” as a slogan, but **safety as a system**.

To keep your continuity tweak clean (re-visit psychiatrist + female endo who cautiously starts anti-androgens), the only structural adjustment you really need is:

- Scene 2 becomes *Lauren checking in / re-anchoring the clinical framing* rather than “first consult,” and
- the endo piece becomes a very controlled moment of **measured intervention** (not “a step toward hormones,” but “we can reduce the distress signal; you stay in charge; we review; you can stop”).

Now—since you’re in flow—here’s the other follow-on micro-scene you mentioned earlier: the **new male hire fails culture**, and the women (Mara, Celeste, the room) enforce the standard. Sharl backs it without performing heroics.

---

## Micro-scene — “Not a Fit” (Celeste POV)

The new hire arrived with confidence he hadn’t earned.

He walked into Wardrobe like it was a place he was doing a favour by showing up—shoulders wide, voice loud, that casual grin men used when they expected women to translate it into charm.

Mara didn’t greet him.

She looked up from the worktable, took him in once, and went back to pinning a seam like her attention was a resource to be allocated, not given away as a social courtesy.

He cleared his throat.

“Morning,” he said, stretching the word into a performance.

No one answered.

Not because the staff were rude. Because they were busy. Because in this room, work came first, and attention was earned by competence, not demanded by a Y-chromosome and a grin.

He tried again, louder. “I said—morning.”

Sarah didn’t even look up. “We heard you,” she said mildly. “We’re simply not clapping.”

A couple of the girls hid smiles. One didn’t.

The man chuckled as if they were all playing.

“Alright then,” he said, and wandered to the closest dress form without asking. His hands went straight for a bodice like it belonged to him.

“Don’t touch that,” Mara said, still not looking up.

He paused, hand hovering. “I’m just—”

“Don’t touch that,” Mara repeated, this time looking directly at him.

He raised his eyebrows in the universal male sign for *calm down, sweetheart.*

“I’m experienced,” he said, with a tone that implied the women should be grateful. “I know what I’m doing.”

Mara blinked once. “If you knew what you were doing, you’d have asked whose work it was.”

He laughed again. That laugh—the one that tried to make seriousness look hysterical.

“Okay, okay,” he said. “No need to be so intense.”

And there it was.

The little pivot. The move men made when a boundary inconvenienced them: convert it into a personality flaw in the woman enforcing it.

Mara didn’t stiffen. She didn’t get louder. She didn’t defend herself.

She simply turned the next page of the ledger on the worktable and wrote a single line with her pen.

Then she said, very calmly, “Leave the room.”

The grin slid off his face. “What?”

“You’re in breach of basic practice,” Mara said. “Leave the room.”

He looked around, expecting someone—anyone—to soften it. To translate Mara’s authority into something he could tolerate.

No one moved.

Sharl was at the ironing board, pressing a stubborn seam into submission. He didn’t look up immediately. He kept the iron moving—steady, controlled—like the work mattered more than the man’s feelings.

But his posture changed.

Not puffed. Not aggressive.

Aligned.

He set the iron upright, carefully, and turned his head just enough to meet the man’s gaze.

It wasn’t a challenge. It wasn’t a threat.

It was the quiet, female-coded signal that said: *This is the line. Don’t test it.*

The man’s eyes narrowed. “And who’s he?” he said, jerking his chin toward Sharl. “Your—what, mascot?”

Something in the room cooled.

Sarah’s mouth tightened, amused no longer. One of the girls made a small sound of disgust.

I felt my own body respond before my mind did, the familiar, hard internal click: **no.**

Mara spoke first. “Don’t talk about my staff that way.”

“I’m just joking,” he said quickly—another classic. “God. Everyone’s so sensitive.”

Sharl’s voice came out low, calm, almost gentle.

“It’s not a joke,” he said. “It’s contempt.”

The man stared, surprised—because he expected softness from women, and silence from anyone he could dismiss as not properly male.

Sharl didn’t raise his voice. He didn’t step forward. He didn’t perform.

He simply stood where he was, hands relaxed at his sides, and let the words sit in the air like a fact.

Mara closed the ledger.

The sound of the cover shutting was small and final.

“You have two options,” she said. “You can leave now, or you can leave after I explain to the agency why you were dismissed within forty-eight hours.”

His face reddened. “Dismissed? You can’t—”

“I can,” Mara said. “I am.”

He spluttered. “This is ridiculous.”

Mara’s expression didn’t change. “No,” she said. “It’s efficient.”

He looked at me then, as if I might step in, as if I might soften it because I was young, because I had a face that made men gamble.

I didn’t.

I met his eyes and said, evenly, “Wardrobe isn’t for you.”

He stared like I’d slapped him.

Sharl, still calm, added the last nail with the same steadiness he used on seams.

“You won’t like it here,” he said. “You’ll keep thinking we’re being mean when we’re just being clear.”

Mara pointed to the door.

The man swore under his breath—small, ugly, meant to sting—and walked out, shoulders stiff, dignity leaking behind him like a trail.

When the door clicked shut, no one cheered.

No one needed to.

Mara opened the ledger again and wrote another line.

Sarah resumed her tea like the world had simply corrected itself.

And Sharl—quietly—picked up the iron and went back to his work.

His hands didn’t shake.

His shoulders stayed low.

The room didn’t feel like a battlefield. It felt like a place where standards existed, and therefore safety did too.

I watched him for a moment longer than I meant to.

Not because he’d “stood up like a man.”

Because he hadn’t.

He’d held the boundary the way women hold boundaries when they’ve had to do it their whole lives: without ceremony, without ego, without needing applause.

And that—more than anything—told me he was exactly where he needed to be.

---

If you want, the next natural beat after these two micro-scenes is a very small one: **Sharl privately repeats Sarah’s “good girl” to himself once** (not as a fetishy mantra—more like a calming phrase he’s slightly startled to find works), and he notices that it doesn’t make him feel ashamed; it makes him feel *steady*. That’s the moment where the “window” becomes something he can’t unsee.

**Robyn:**

This IS my message, exactly. This scene is an essential one to the story. 

And yes, in your next scene: Sharl is looking in the mirror and seeing himself properly... says "good girl" softly, to himself. His stance vis-a-vis blokeyness was revelatory to himself as well as others how he is aligned.

**Emily:**

## Micro-scene — “The Mirror” (Close on Sharl)

At home, the silence was different.

At Wardrobe, silence meant concentration—hands moving, fabric behaving, purpose held in the air like a rule. Here, in his small room, silence had edges. It could turn on him if he wasn’t careful.

He didn’t turn on the overhead light. He used the lamp by the mirror instead, the one with the warm bulb that made shadows gentle and didn’t glare at him like an interrogation.

He washed his hands first, out of habit. Then again, slower, because he liked the feeling of it. The clean, the reset. The part of the day that belonged to no one else.

When he finally faced the mirror, he did what he always did lately: he looked everywhere except his own eyes.

He looked at his hair—how it fell, how it sat, whether it needed pinning back tomorrow. He looked at his collarbone, the line of his neck, the way a posture change could make him look like a different person. He looked at the angle of his shoulders and made them smaller without thinking, as if his body had learned a new resting shape.

Then he stopped.

Because he remembered the man’s grin.

The entitlement. The “I’m just joking.” The contempt dressed up like humour.

And he remembered what had happened in his own chest in that moment—how something had gone still and cold and certain, like a door bolting shut.

It hadn’t felt like anger, exactly. Not the loud kind he’d seen in blokes. Not the puffed-up performance of dominance.

It had felt like… alignment.

A line drawn.

*No.*

He’d said it out loud—*It’s contempt*—and the whole room had snapped into clarity around it. Not because he was important, but because the women had already been living by that rule. He’d simply spoken in their language.

He watched himself in the mirror now, and for once he didn’t flinch from the thought.

*You didn’t do that like a man would.*

The old version of him—trained, by habit and fear, to seek permission from masculinity—waited for shame to arrive.

It didn’t.

Instead there was a quiet, steady warmth that spread through his ribs, as if his nervous system had finally received a message it trusted.

He leaned closer to the mirror. Not to inspect. To meet.

His eyes looked different when he met them directly. Softer, yes—but also clearer. Less pleading. Less performative. Like someone who had stopped trying to pass an exam he never wanted to sit.

He lifted his chin a fraction, tested a stance the way he tested a seam: *does it pull, does it strain, does it sit right?*

Shoulders low.

Spine long.

Hands relaxed.

He didn’t look like a boy trying to be brave.

He looked like someone who belonged to herself.

The thought startled him so much his breath caught.

He looked down, then back up again, and he heard Sarah’s voice as if it were still in the workroom—casual, wicked, ordinary:

*Good girl.*

His throat tightened. Not with humiliation. With the strange, bright ache of recognition.

He didn’t say it immediately. He let the words sit inside him and asked himself, carefully, whether saying them would feel like lying.

He waited for the recoil. The disgust. The panic.

None came.

What came instead was relief so clean it frightened him.

He swallowed, leaned in just a touch, and spoke softly—so softly the words seemed to land on the mirror rather than in the room.

“Good girl.”

He watched his own face as he said it.

There was no theatrical blush. No grin. No performance.

Just a small change—his eyes easing, the corners of his mouth letting go, his shoulders dropping a millimetre as if they’d been holding up a weight no one had ever asked him to name.

He exhaled.

Again, quieter, like a confirmation.

“Good girl.”

This time it wasn’t even about Sarah. Or the workplace. Or Celeste noticing.

It was about the fact that the phrase didn’t pin him down.

It opened him up.

He stood there for another long moment, looking at himself properly, not searching for flaws, not bracing for punishment—just… seeing.

And he realised something with a clarity that made his stomach flip, as if a page in a book had been turned and there was no going back:

It wasn’t that he *could* be soft.

It was that softness had always been the honest default—until he’d spent years training himself out of it to survive other people’s expectations.

He stepped back from the mirror and began his night routine—simple, methodical. Cleanser. Moisturiser. Hair brushed out and clipped back for sleep. The quiet care of someone who wasn’t trying to impress anyone, only trying to live inside their own skin without flinching.

When he finally climbed into bed, he didn’t repeat the words again.

He didn’t need to.

They were already there—settled somewhere under his breastbone like a steady light.

Not a spotlight.

A lamp in a hallway.

A door he could choose to open, when he was ready.

And for the first time in his life, the idea of walking through it didn’t scare him.

It calmed him.

**Robyn:**

Shift in time. The weather is getting warmer: winter is done. Sharl has been on anti-androgens for over 9 months. He decides he wants another visit with the endocrinologist to discuss the next step. He speaks to Lauren, who by now realises the inevitable. Sharl's whole demeanour not just around Celeste but everyone has changed. It is clear to all he has found his centre, his reality, not for anyone but himself. Lauren and Sharl broach HRT awkwardly, almost simultaneously, but with Lauren supportive and loving. Mothers know: good mothers support. And Lauren is beyond a good mother: she encourages: not coersion, not seduction, but as a full realisation of himself.

**Emily:**

## Scene — “The Next Step” (Lauren POV)

Spring didn’t arrive with a trumpet.

It arrived with small betrayals of the old season: the jacket left on the back of a chair, untouched all day; the way the mornings stopped biting; the scent of warmed eucalyptus drifting in through an open door and making the building feel less like a workshop and more like a place people actually lived.

Wardrobe changed with the weather. Fabrics shifted. The rhythm did too. Winter’s urgency—layers, repairs, triage—gave way to spring’s quieter precision. Fewer emergencies. More refinement. More room to notice what was becoming.

Lauren noticed, because she always did.

Nine months on anti-androgens had not turned Sharl into a different person so much as it had removed a constant static from his body. His face had softened in the way a clenched jaw softens when it finally believes it won’t be punished for resting. His shoulders sat lower. His voice, when it arrived, arrived cleanly—less defensive, less braced. Even his silence was different now: not withdrawal, but peace.

And perhaps most telling of all, he had stopped orbiting Celeste like a planet trying to be worthy of a sun.

He still cared—Lauren could see that care like sunlight in the corners of his attention—but it wasn’t frantic anymore. He didn’t “perform calm” around her. He simply *was* calm. With Celeste. With Sarah. With Mara. With everyone.

Not for anyone else.

For himself.

That was what made Lauren’s stomach tighten, in the way it tightened when a truth went from “likely” to “inevitable.”

It was a Wednesday afternoon—one of those almost-summer days where the air felt lighter, as if the world had decided to stop holding its breath.

Lauren was at the small desk in the back office, going through invoices with the kind of focus that only came from knowing she was doing something that mattered. Not glamorous. Not poetic. Consequential.

She heard the soft knock before she saw him.

“Yeah,” she called, eyes still on the numbers.

The door opened. Sharl stepped in and shut it behind him with careful quiet, as if he was aware that whatever he was about to say deserved privacy.

He stood there for a second, hands loosely at his sides, and Lauren saw the telltale detail: he’d washed his hands. Of course he had. Ritual before difficult conversations. Reset before stepping into new territory.

“Hey,” he said.

“Hey,” Lauren replied, and finally looked up.

He looked… steady.

Not confident in the brittle way men got confident when they were bluffing.

Steady the way a person looks when they’ve stopped trying to win and started trying to live.

Lauren gestured to the chair opposite her desk. “Sit.”

He sat, but not like someone being summoned. Like someone who had chosen to come.

A beat passed.

He took a breath, then released it slowly.

“I want to go back,” he said.

Lauren didn’t pretend to misunderstand. “To see Dr. —?”

“The endocrinologist,” Sharl confirmed. His eyes held Lauren’s this time. He didn’t dodge. He didn’t apologise for having a need.

Lauren nodded once. “Okay.”

He blinked—small surprise that she hadn’t made him earn it with questions.

Lauren kept her voice neutral, because neutrality was safety. “Tell me why now.”

Sharl’s fingers moved against his knee—one, two, three—then stilled, as if he’d decided fidgeting didn’t help.

“I’ve been on the blockers a long time,” he said carefully, like he was choosing the words that wouldn’t turn this into a speech. “And it’s… it’s helped. A lot.”

“I can see that,” Lauren said.

His mouth tightened briefly—emotion trying to show itself and being politely declined. “Yeah.”

Lauren leaned back slightly, giving him space without withdrawing. “And you’re thinking about the next step.”

Sharl’s breath caught.

For a second, Lauren watched him decide whether to retreat into old habits—deflect, joke, fold himself smaller.

He didn’t.

He nodded once, small but decisive. “Yeah.”

There was no theatrical pause. No trembling confession. Just the quiet click of someone lining up their life with their own truth.

Lauren let another beat pass, the way good mothers did when they were inviting a child to cross a threshold without being shoved.

Then Sharl spoke again, and the words came out awkwardly, almost too quick, as if he was trying to get them over with.

“I want to talk about… hormones.”

Lauren inhaled.

Not because she was shocked.

Because she felt the weight of it—the responsibility of saying the right thing, in the right way, at the right volume. The responsibility of not making this about her relief, her pride, her fear.

Before she could respond, Sharl added—almost simultaneously, as if he’d heard his own sentence and wanted to correct its tone:

“Not like— I mean, I’m not asking you to—”

Lauren cut in, gentle but firm. “You don’t have to soften it for me.”

He stopped. Looked at her.

Lauren held his gaze. “You’re allowed to say what you want.”

His throat bobbed. He tried again, slower.

“I want to talk about estradiol,” he said.

It landed in the room like a clean object placed on a table. Not tossed. Not hidden. Not dressed up.

Lauren felt, irrationally, like she could hear the building around them—the hum of the sewing machines out in the workroom, the distant laughter from Sarah, the soft thump of Mara’s footsteps—continuing as if nothing monumental had been said. That was what made Wardrobe special: it could hold big truths without turning them into theatre.

Lauren nodded. “Okay,” she said again, because the first kindness was consistency.

His eyes searched her face, as if he still expected the adult world to pull the rug out the moment he named himself too clearly.

Lauren didn’t blink.

“Why?” she asked—not as interrogation, but as due care. “What’s pulling you toward it?”

Sharl’s shoulders rose, then fell.

“I feel… centred,” he said quietly. “More than I ever have. And I don’t want to go back to surviving myself.”

Lauren’s chest tightened.

He continued, voice steady now that he’d started. “The blockers gave me space. Like… the noise got turned down.” He hesitated, then added with a blunt honesty that would have belonged to any woman in that building: “But I can tell I’m still… stuck between.”

Lauren nodded, letting the sentence stand without rushing to interpret it for him.

He looked down at his hands, then up again. “I want the outside to match the inside,” he said. “Not for Celeste. Not for anyone at work. For me.”

Lauren could have cried, but she didn’t. Tears were for later, for alone. Right now, she was the adult in the room, and what he needed was a steady surface to push off from.

“Mothers know,” Lauren said softly.

Sharl’s brow furrowed. “What?”

Lauren’s mouth softened into something almost-smile. “I mean—good mothers know when a kid is telling the truth about themselves. And good mothers support.”

His eyes shimmered for a second. He blinked it away quickly, embarrassed by the betrayal of his own body.

Lauren leaned forward, elbows on the desk, and lowered her voice—not conspiratorial, just intimate.

“I’m not going to coerce you,” she said. “I’m not going to seduce you into a narrative. I’m not going to treat this like a project.”

Sharl’s lips parted slightly. Relief.

“But,” Lauren continued, and let the word carry its full meaning, “I am going to encourage you to be honest.”

He swallowed.

Lauren held him steady with her gaze. “If estradiol is what you want—if you understand what it means, what it changes, what it doesn’t—then the most loving thing I can do is not make you feel like you have to tiptoe around it.”

Sharl exhaled, and this time it wasn’t shaky. It was clean.

“I was scared you’d think I was rushing,” he admitted.

Lauren’s eyes narrowed, not at him—at the idea that he’d had to be afraid of that. “Nine months is not rushing,” she said. “Nine months is listening.”

He let out a breath that sounded like laughter but wasn’t. “Yeah.”

Lauren tapped her pen once against the desk, a small practical gesture that made the moment less fragile. “Alright. Logistics.”

Sharl blinked. “Logistics?”

“Yes,” Lauren said, matter-of-fact. “We book the appointment. You go in with your questions written down. You tell her what you’ve told me. You ask about dosing, monitoring, timelines, risks, fertility preservation if that’s relevant to you—everything.”

His cheeks flushed slightly. “Okay.”

“And,” Lauren added, her voice sharpening into its protective edge, “you don’t let anyone make you feel like you have to perform certainty. It’s okay to be scared. It’s okay to be excited. It’s okay to be both.”

He nodded, throat tight. “Okay.”

Lauren paused, then said the part that mattered most.

“And Sharl?”

He looked up.

“This stays yours,” Lauren said. “Even with my support. Even with Celeste’s environment. Even with the clinic. If you ever decide to slow down, pause, stop—there’s no punishment. No disappointment. No ‘you led us on.’”

His eyes closed briefly, as if the permission to have agency had hit him like sunlight.

When he opened them, his gaze was clear.

“I don’t want to stop,” he said quietly.

Lauren held the weight of that sentence like it was fragile and strong at the same time.

“Then we don’t treat it like a taboo,” she replied. “We treat it like healthcare.”

Sharl nodded, and for the first time, there was the faintest hint of a smile—small, private, not seeking approval.

Lauren felt her own eyes sting then, and she let herself have one honest breath of it. Pride. Love. Relief.

“Thank you,” he said.

Lauren shook her head once. “Don’t thank me for being decent.”

He hesitated. “I mean—thank you for… not making it weird.”

Lauren’s smile finally arrived—brief and real.

“Oh,” she said. “I’ll make it weird in plenty of other ways. I’m still me.”

His laugh escaped properly this time. Quick. Warm.

Lauren stood, moved around the desk, and rested a hand lightly on his shoulder—not gripping, not claiming, just anchoring. The touch you gave someone when you wanted them to feel the truth without being swallowed by it.

“You found your centre,” she said softly. “I can see it. Everyone can.”

Sharl’s eyes dropped, then returned to hers.

“Yeah,” he whispered. “I did.”

Lauren nodded once, decisive.

“Then let’s take the next step like we do everything else in this place,” she said. “Quietly. Competently. With you in charge.”

He swallowed, then nodded.

And the room—this small office, this workshop, this life the women had built around standards instead of sentiment—held him without demanding anything back.

Outside, the day was warm enough that the air itself felt like permission.

**Robyn:**

The only thing that was missing from the scene was a mother's hug (at the risk of sounding cliché), but otherwise: perfect. Now, I'd like to avoid all the clinical aspect of this and allow Sharl his privacy. And Lauren's as well: we will return to her feelings about her son transitioning later (glad you touched on it in this scene). The focus now is on orders coming in from the US for winter wear costumes (Thanksgiving pageants, Christmas plays, etc). The money is real now, the atelier is feeling cramped. Mara still wants to control things but it is getting harder. Do they out-source aspects of the garment-making? We can do this scene in late spring.

**Emily:**

You’re right about the hug. It *is* a cliché — which is exactly why it works: it’s the one physical gesture that says, without language, *“I’ve got you. You’re not doing this alone.”* And it doesn’t cheapen the scene if you keep it brief, almost matter-of-fact, the way good mothers do it when they’re trying not to cry.

Here’s a tiny “button” you can drop into the end of the Lauren/Sharl scene without changing anything else:

### Quick insert: the mother’s hug (2–3 beats, not syrupy)
Lauren comes around the desk, rests a hand on his shoulder (as written)… then, instead of leaving it there, she pulls him into a firm, quick hug. Not a swaying cuddle. A *brace*.

He stiffens for half a second out of old habit—then melts into it with a small exhale like his body finally believes it’s allowed to be held. Lauren releases him before it can turn into a scene.

“Right,” she says briskly, voice slightly rough. “Appointment. Questions. Water. Sleep.”

And Sharl, blinking hard, manages: “Yes, ma’am,” with the faintest smile.

That’s all you need.

---

Now—onto late spring, money real, atelier cramped, Mara trying to hold the whole machine in her hands while the machine grows teeth.

Below is a full scene draft that **keeps the clinical/privacy offstage**, and pivots hard into: US winter orders, production stress, the women’s competence network expanding, and Mara learning that “control” has to evolve into “standards + delegation.”

## Scene — “The Backlog” (Celeste POV, late spring)

Spring heat did not feel romantic inside Wardrobe.

It felt like fabric sticking to forearms. Like threads catching on damp fingertips. Like the old ceiling fan doing its best and still losing.

The atelier had always been small, but it had been *enough*—a place with clear zones, clear rules, clear sightlines. Now it looked like someone had poured in prosperity and forgotten to build the container.

Boxes were stacked by the door in a lean tower that made Sarah call it “the Jenga of capitalism.” A roll of wool sat in the corridor like an animal too large to move. The cutting table had become a battlefield: patterns taped down, notes pinned up, an army of muslin pieces marching toward the edge.

And on the whiteboard—where there used to be a neat list of fittings and repairs—there was a block of writing so dense it looked like a ransom note.

**USA WINTER RUN**
- Thanksgiving pageants
- Christmas plays
- “Colonial” school programs
- “Victorian Carol” ensembles
- “Frontier” winterwear
- “Dickens” coats + capes
- sizes: CHILDREN / TEENS / ADULTS
- rush shipping windows
- deposits cleared

Deposits cleared.

That phrase had changed the air in the room more than the weather.

Money was real now. Not “a few orders, nice work.” Real as in: *a pipeline*. Real as in: *if they didn’t solve this, the success would kill them.*

Mara stood at the cutting table with the ledger open like a holy book.

Not the accounting ledger—Mara’s ledger. The garment ledger. The one that tracked wear-tests, failure points, fixes, re-tests. The one that didn’t care about excitement.

It cared about what worked.

Lauren was at the back desk with her laptop open and a stack of printed invoices that made the surface look like it had grown paper scales.

Sarah hovered near the shipping corner with a tape gun and the kind of predatory patience she reserved for people who didn’t understand labels.

Sharl moved between stations as if he could sense where friction would happen before it happened. He didn’t ask for attention. He didn’t take up space the way the new bloke had tried to. He simply—quietly, reliably—made things run.

His calm had become… structural. A stabiliser bar in a car.

And that was the problem, I realised.

We were building an entire operation that depended on three women and one young person’s steadiness.

That wasn’t a plan. That was a future bottleneck with a pretty face.

Lauren cleared her throat.

“Mara,” she said, voice calm, not pleading, not flattering, “we need to talk about capacity.”

Mara didn’t look up. “We have capacity,” she said, and pinned a paper pattern down so hard the table seemed to flinch.

Lauren didn’t rise to it. “We have *work ethic*,” she corrected. “We don’t have capacity.”

Mara’s pen paused.

The heat made patience thin, but Lauren’s never snapped. It just… sharpened.

“These US orders,” Lauren continued, tapping the printouts, “are not a one-off. They’ve come in because your work is good and Celeste’s standard is consistent and the photos look like a promise kept. That means the next wave will come in *sooner*, not later.”

Mara’s jaw tightened. “And we make them.”

“And we make them,” Lauren agreed. “But not like this.”

Mara finally looked up, and the look was pure Mara: *What do you mean, not like this? This is how work is done. This is the only way work is done. Work is done by my hands.*

“Explain,” Mara said, flatly.

Lauren gestured around the room. “We’re cramped. We’re tripping over inventory. We’re losing hours to moving things from one place to another. We’re doing skilled work in an environment that forces unskilled chaos.”

Sarah, without looking up from her tape gun, added, “And if I step on one more box of buttons, I’m going to start charging by the swear word.”

Mara ignored Sarah. Her eyes fixed on Lauren. “So what? We rent a warehouse? We become a factory? Is that what you want?”

Lauren didn’t blink. “No. I want us to stop pretending that ‘control’ means ‘every stitch passes through your hands.’”

Mara’s expression went hard.

I could feel the old reflex in the room—the one people had around Mara when they feared her temper, or her disappointment, or worse: her contempt.

But this was not that era of Wardrobe anymore.

We had money now. We had momentum. We had consequences.

And the women in this room were not going to let Mara turn success into a martyrdom performance.

I stepped in, voice even.

“Mara,” I said, “I’m not asking you to stop controlling the standard.”

Her eyes flicked to me. “You think I’m being unreasonable.”

“I think you’re being *you*,” I replied. “And it works when the volume is small. It doesn’t scale.”

Sarah made a delighted little noise, as if I’d just stabbed a balloon.

Mara’s lips tightened. “You want to outsource.”

Lauren nodded. “Parts of it.”

Mara’s head turned sharply. “No.”

It was immediate. Not considered. Not debated.

A refusal that came from somewhere older than the business: craft pride, fear of dilution, the trauma of seeing quality destroyed by shortcuts.

I watched her closely. Mara didn’t fear hard work. She feared being made irrelevant.

So I gave her the only language she would respect.

“Not outsource the *garment*,” I said. “Outsource the *labour that doesn’t require your eye.*”

Mara scoffed. “Everything requires my eye.”

“No,” I said, and made my tone firm, not unkind. “It requires your *standard.* There’s a difference.”

Lauren leaned forward slightly. “We create packets,” she said. “Bench packets. Pattern, seam allowance, order of operations, fabric type, thread colour, trim placement, photos of the correct result, and the tolerances. What gets outsourced is: basic assembly. Straight seams. Lining prep. Petticoat gathering. Understructure components. Things that are time-heavy and skill-light.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “And who checks it?”

“You do,” Lauren said immediately. “But not by doing it. By inspecting it.”

Mara’s mouth twisted like the word tasted wrong. “Inspecting is how you catch failures, not how you prevent them.”

I didn’t argue. I built.

“Then we prevent them the way you already prevent them,” I said, tapping Mara’s ledger. “We define failure points *before* they happen. We write them down. We build the packet so even a competent home seamstress can’t accidentally do the wrong thing.”

Sarah’s voice floated in, dry as salt. “Plus, we’ll pay them properly, so they don’t half-arse it.”

Mara’s eyes snapped toward her. “This isn’t about money.”

Sarah smiled sweetly. “It always becomes about money when you’re the one doing three people’s work.”

Sharl, who had been quietly pressing a seam near the back, looked up at that. His eyes didn’t go anxious. They went… attentive.

He didn’t speak unless invited now. Not out of timidity—out of discipline. He’d learned what women learned early: speaking at the wrong time gets you punished.

I watched him for a second and made a decision.

“Sharl,” I said.

He turned immediately. “Yes?”

“Come here,” I said, and meant: *you’re part of this. Not as a token. As a stabiliser.*

He approached, hands clean, posture calm.

Mara’s gaze sharpened slightly, as if she didn’t like him being pulled into strategy.

Good.

Sharl stopped at the table. He didn’t look at Mara like she was a god. He looked at her like she was a craftsperson with a problem.

“What do you think?” I asked him.

He took a breath.

“The packet idea is good,” he said carefully. “If it’s written the way Mara writes things.”

Mara’s eyebrows lifted a fraction.

Sharl continued, voice steady. “We can define what’s allowed to vary and what isn’t. Like… seam allowance tolerance. Stitch length. Pressing direction.” He looked at the ledger. “All the things that make something feel ‘Wardrobe’ instead of… generic.”

Lauren’s eyes softened. She could see, as I could, that this wasn’t just competence. It was belonging.

“And,” Sharl added, turning slightly toward Mara, “you’d still be the gate. Nothing goes out without your check.”

Mara stared at him.

It was almost funny: the one person in the room Mara hadn’t been able to bully or charm—because he didn’t respond to male social games—was now speaking to her in her own language.

Standards.

Process.

Authority without theatrics.

Mara’s pen hovered above the ledger again.

“What parts?” she asked, grudgingly.

Lauren didn’t pounce. She answered like this had been planned.

“Three tiers,” she said. “Tier one: outsource immediately—petticoats, shifts, basic linings, simple capes. Tier two: outsource with strict packets—coats minus finishing, bodice shells that you fit and finish here, sleeves pre-assembled. Tier three: never outsource—final fitting, closure placement, trim work, anything visible on stage in close-up, and anything that carries your signature.”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “And the risk.”

Lauren nodded. “Yes. The risk. That’s why we start with a pilot. Twenty percent of the order. One trusted contractor at a time. You inspect. You reject anything that misses the standard. No guilt. No apology.”

Sarah’s voice chimed in again, delighted. “God, I love rejection as policy.”

Mara ignored her, eyes still on Lauren. “Where do we find contractors.”

Lauren’s expression was almost smug—just for a second. “We already have a list,” she said. “Mothers. Retired seamstresses. Two local small workshops. People who can sew, who want the work, and who will be grateful for clear specs and fair pay.”

Mara looked at me then, as if to say *you’ve been planning behind my back.*

I held her gaze.

“Yes, we had to,” my expression said. “Because this is bigger than your fear.”

I said aloud, gentler but firm, “Mara, this is the part where you stop being the entire machine and become the person who sets the standard for the machine.”

Mara’s jaw worked.

She hated it.

She also understood it.

Finally she exhaled through her nose and said the closest thing Mara ever produced to agreement.

“Fine.”

Lauren didn’t smile. She didn’t celebrate. She simply nodded, like a judge recording a ruling.

Mara lifted her pen and wrote something in the ledger.

I leaned forward slightly. “What did you write?”

Mara didn’t look up. “New category,” she said. “Outsourced component. Inspection protocol.”

Lauren let out a quiet breath that might have been laughter if she was anyone else.

Sarah tapped the tape gun against her palm like a percussion instrument. “Welcome to growth, babes.”

Mara’s eyes flicked up. “Don’t call me that.”

Sarah beamed. “Noted.”

Sharl’s shoulders lowered a fraction, and the room—briefly, in that sticky spring heat—felt less cramped.

Not because the boxes had moved.

Because the future had.

---

### If you want, here are two clean follow-ups we can write next (no clinic, no privacy breach):
1) **The outsourcing pilot begins** — first delivery comes back with two subtle failures only Mara would see; she rejects it without cruelty, sends back a corrected packet, and the contractor improves fast. This shows Mara evolving into “standard-setter,” not “martyr.”
2) **The US orders accelerate** — Celeste and Lauren realise they need physical expansion: a second room, a small adjacent tenancy, or a “finishing-only” space. Mara resists; Celeste wins with a single sentence: *“If you want control, we need room to see.”*

Tell me which one you want next, and I’ll draft it in-scene.

**Robyn:**

You OWN This, Mara. Excellent scene. And yes please to followup scenes: both of them in sequence, if you can.

**Emily:**

Perfect. Here are the two follow-up scenes in sequence—first the **outsourcing pilot returning with subtle failures**, then the **US orders accelerating into the “we need space” decision**. I’ve kept it entirely on the business/craft axis: standards, process, culture, power. No clinic. No privacy breach. Sharl stays present as steadiness, not spectacle.

---

## Scene — “The First Box Back” (Celeste POV)

The first outsourced delivery arrived on a morning that felt too bright for the amount of work waiting inside.

Sunlight poured in at an angle that made every dust mote look like evidence. The air had that late-spring warmth—pleasant outside, already slightly aggressive inside—where fabric clung to forearms and patience wore thin faster than thread.

Sarah wheeled the box in on a trolley like she was delivering a verdict.

“Behold,” she announced, “the fruits of capitalism.”

Mara didn’t look up from the cutting table. She didn’t have to. Her whole body had already clocked the box, measured its dimensions, judged the tape job, decided whether the weight seemed right.

Lauren followed it in with the invoice printout in hand—calm, watchful, annoyingly correct.

I felt the room do what it always did when Mara was about to assess something: it quieted without being told. Like everyone’s nervous system had learned that the moment *inspection* began, you didn’t offer commentary. You offered space.

Sharl came in from the pressing station, hands clean, posture neutral. He stopped where he could see without hovering.

Mara finally set her shears down.

“Put it on the table,” she said.

Sarah did, and stepped back as if the box might explode.

Mara didn’t perform suspense. She cut the tape cleanly, folded the cardboard back with methodical care, and pulled out the first bundle—muslin-wrapped, labelled in neat handwriting. The contractor had followed the packet’s labeling system.

Good.

Mara’s expression didn’t change. She lifted the first item, shook it out once, and laid it flat on the cutting table like a body on a slab.

A petticoat.

White. Clean. Even gathering. The hem looked straight at first glance.

At first glance was for amateurs.

Mara ran her fingers along the waistband, then flipped it and looked at the inside seam. Her gaze didn’t dart. It tracked, steadily, like a needle following a line.

She pinched the seam between two fingers and frowned.

She said nothing.

That silence was the thing that made my own stomach tighten. Mara could yell and it would still feel less consequential than Mara going quiet.

She moved to the hem. She held it up to the light. Her thumb slid along the stitching, feeling for inconsistency.

Then she set it down and reached for the next item: a cape lining.

Same ritual. Shake. Lay. Scan. Touch.

This one made her nostrils flare—a small, involuntary sign that something was wrong.

She turned it inside out, held the seam allowance between her fingers, and looked at the seam finish.

Still no words.

Sarah, incapable of silence for more than twelve seconds, said quietly, “Is it… hideous?”

Mara’s eyes flicked up, slow and dangerous. “Don’t talk,” she said, without raising her voice.

Sarah shut her mouth like a snapped purse.

Mara went back to the work. She pulled out three more components. She examined each with the same grim focus.

Finally, she set her hands flat on the table.

Lauren waited, and I watched her do it—how she managed to be supportive without trying to soften Mara. Lauren understood something most people never did: Mara’s softness was the standard. You didn’t ask her to dilute it. You built around it.

Mara looked up at Lauren.

“Two failures,” Mara said at last.

Lauren didn’t blink. “Which.”

Mara tapped the petticoat waistband with a fingernail. “Gathering is fine. Hem is fine.” She moved to the inside seam and pinched the fabric. “They used the wrong seam finish. I specified flat-felled for durability. They used overlock.”

Lauren nodded once. “Okay.”

Mara slid the cape lining forward. “Pressing direction wrong. The seam roll is showing. On stage, under lights, it will cast shadow. It will look cheap.”

Sarah’s face did a comical little twist, as if she’d heard a crime described in a foreign language.

Lauren asked, “Anything else?”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Stitch length.” She pointed to a line. “Too long. Not catastrophic, but it will weaken under stress.”

I leaned forward slightly, voice even. “So we reject.”

Mara didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”

The word landed like a stamp.

A tiny flinch ran through the room—not at the decision, but at the social discomfort people always tried to attach to rejection. As if rejecting substandard work was rude.

Mara looked around and seemed to read that flinch.

Her voice sharpened.

“This is not personal,” she said. “This is a product.”

Lauren nodded. “Agreed.”

Mara picked up the packet—our packet, the one Lauren and I and Sharl had helped refine—and opened it to the “Failure Points” page.

She tapped a line with her pen. **SEAM FINISH: MUST BE FLAT-FELLED. NO OVERLOCK.**

She wrote something beneath it in her tight, brutal handwriting:

**ADD PHOTO EXAMPLE. ADD NOTE: OVERLOCK = REJECT.**

Then she flipped another page.

**PRESS DIRECTION: ALWAYS AWAY FROM FRONT EDGE.**

She wrote again:

**ADD DIAGRAM. ADD “WHY”: SHADOW UNDER LIGHTS.**

Sharl, quiet at the edge of the table, spoke softly. Not defensively. Not pleading. Like someone offering the missing bolt.

“We should add a test instruction,” he said. “Hold it under a lamp at forty-five degrees. If the seam line shows, press again.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to him.

A heartbeat.

Then: “Yes.”

A simple yes. Not praise. Not gratitude. Confirmation that his contribution was correct.

Lauren’s gaze softened in that small way it did when she saw a young person being folded into the adult world properly—through competence, not sentiment.

Mara closed the ledger.

Then she did something that, for Mara, was enormous.

She looked at Lauren and said, “Call them.”

Lauren didn’t flinch. “Now?”

“Now,” Mara repeated.

Lauren pulled her phone out, already composed. She didn’t put the contractor on speaker—not because she was hiding, but because this wasn’t theatre for the room.

Mara, however, didn’t retreat. She stood beside Lauren, like a judge standing beside a clerk while the ruling was read.

I could only hear Lauren’s side.

“Hi. Yes, we received the pilot components. Thank you—your labelling is excellent.” Pause. “We’re rejecting two categories. Not because it’s terrible—because it’s not to spec.”

Lauren listened, and her face stayed calm and kind and firm. She was good at this: she could deliver consequences without humiliation.

When she finished, she handed the phone to Mara without a word.

Mara took it and spoke into it like a person who had decided clarity was mercy.

“I don’t want apologies,” Mara said. “I want adherence.” Pause. “You did good work. You did *not* do Wardrobe work.” Pause. “I’m sending an updated packet today. You redo these pieces. You get paid for the redo if you follow spec. You don’t if you don’t.”

She listened.

Her expression didn’t soften. But her tone didn’t cruelly sharpen either. It stayed practical, objective.

“Yes. Flat-felled. Not overlock.” Pause. “Press direction. Lamp test.” Pause. “Good. Next delivery in five days.”

She ended the call.

Sarah, who had been vibrating with curiosity, murmured, “That was… terrifyingly fair.”

Mara ignored her and turned to the table again.

“Good,” she said to the room, as if announcing a workday rule. “This is how it works. We don’t outsource trust. We outsource labour. Trust stays here.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked to me, a silent *told you*.

I nodded once.

And as Mara began revising the packet with the same seriousness she used for sewing, I understood something in my bones:

This wasn’t Mara losing control.

This was Mara translating control into **system**.

That was bigger.

And it would save us.

---

## Scene — “Room to See” (Celeste POV)

Two weeks later, the second outsourced delivery arrived.

It was better.

Not perfect—Mara had corrected one small thing that no contractor would ever anticipate—but better enough that she didn’t reject it. She marked the minor failure with a note, adjusted the packet again, and passed the pieces forward for finishing with a grunt that counted as approval.

The pilot was working.

Which meant the next problem arrived immediately, because success never waited politely for you to catch your breath.

The US orders doubled.

They didn’t just want capes and petticoats. They wanted coats. Layered looks. “Authentic winter sets.” They wanted children’s sizes in bulk. They wanted quick turnaround so the costumes could ship in time for rehearsals and pageants and whatever sentimental theatre Americans staged in school halls when November turned into December.

And they paid.

They paid deposits that made Lauren’s eyes go sharp and focused, like she could see the business becoming a real creature with real bones.

The atelier, however, remained the same size.

Which meant prosperity began to feel like clutter and heat and friction.

A roll of wool took up half the corridor. Finished garments hung from every possible hook like a forest of sleeves. Boxes of trim stacked higher than Sarah’s patience.

Mara tried to compensate the only way she knew: by tightening.

More rules. More checklists. More “don’t touch that.” More “not there.” More precision.

It helped—until it didn’t.

Because the room itself had become the bottleneck.

We were still stepping around things. Still moving stacks just to reach the table. Still doing skilled work with our elbows pinned in by cardboard.

The day it snapped was almost comically mundane.

Mara was inspecting a finished coat—a beautiful piece, heavy and structured, the kind of thing that looked expensive even from across a stage. She went to turn, and her elbow clipped a hanging rail.

The rail swayed.

A sleeve caught.

A row of freshly pressed garments shifted like dominoes.

Sarah lunged to catch them and swore creatively in a voice that could have curdled milk.

Sharl moved instantly—quiet, fast, competent—steadying the rail, preventing the fall, saving hours of work with one simple, controlled action.

No drama. No heroics.

Just: *prevent the damage.*

The moment passed.

But something in me went cold and clear.

This was not sustainable.

I saw Lauren’s face too—tight with the same thought. I saw Mara’s jaw clench as if the room itself had betrayed her.

Mara turned back to the coat, hands firm on the fabric like she could force the building to behave through will alone.

“We need discipline,” Mara said flatly.

Sarah barked a laugh. “We need a second building.”

Mara shot her a look.

Sarah held up both hands. “What? I’m being practical for once.”

Lauren stepped in, calm as law. “We need space.”

Mara’s shoulders stiffened. “We have space.”

Lauren didn’t argue. She gestured.

The corridor blocked by wool. The table crowded with boxes. The hanging rail swaying like a warning.

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Space is expensive.”

Lauren’s voice stayed even. “So is missing delivery windows. So is rework because things get crushed. So is staff burning out. So is your standard collapsing under volume.”

Mara’s face darkened. “My standard doesn’t collapse.”

I stepped forward.

“Mara,” I said, voice controlled, “your standard isn’t collapsing.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to me—sharp, defensive, almost wounded.

I continued, “Your *room* is.”

Silence.

The kind that meant I’d landed something.

Mara’s fingers tightened on the coat. “We outsource more.”

“We are outsourcing more,” Lauren said. “It reduces labour. It doesn’t reduce physical congestion. We still need finishing space. Inspection space. Packing space. A place where your eye can do what it needs to do without tripping over a box of braid.”

Mara looked at the room like she wanted to squeeze it into obedience.

Then she did the thing Mara did when she felt threatened: she tried to pull everything back under her own hands.

“No,” she said. “We can make this work.”

Sarah’s voice was mild, but it cut. “You can make *anything* work. That’s not the question.”

Mara’s eyes flashed.

Sarah went on, almost gentle. “The question is whether you want to keep making it work by bleeding yourself dry.”

Mara’s mouth opened—closed—opened again.

She didn’t have an answer.

Because it was true, and Mara hated truth that made her feel human.

I let a beat pass, then spoke with the simplest, cleanest line I had.

“If you want control,” I said, “we need room to see.”

Mara froze.

Not because she hadn’t considered expansion.

Because I’d framed it in her language.

Not “growth,” not “business,” not “opportunity.”

Control.

Seeing.

Her pen hovered in the air as if she were about to write the sentence into her ledger and make it binding.

Lauren watched Mara carefully, like a mother watching a stubborn child approach a necessary concession.

Mara swallowed once.

“Where,” Mara said at last, voice rough, “do you propose we get this… room?”

Lauren didn’t smile. She answered like she’d been waiting for this moment.

“The tenancy next door is empty,” she said. “Small. Not a warehouse. Just a room.” She slid a paper across the table—already printed, already researched. “We take it as finishing and packing. Inspection happens there. Shipping stays out of the main workroom. Your cutting table becomes a cutting table again.”

Mara stared at the paper like it was an insult.

Then she looked up at me. “And you?”

I met her gaze. “I’m not asking your permission to keep this business alive,” I said evenly. “I’m asking you to lead it.”

The air felt thick.

Then Mara exhaled, sharp, and said the closest thing she ever offered to surrender:

“Fine.”

Lauren’s shoulders loosened with relief, just slightly.

Mara pointed at the paper. “But the standards go with us.”

“Of course,” I said.

Mara’s jaw tightened. “No one touches finished garments without gloves. No packing without checklist. No label changes. No substitutions.”

Sarah murmured, delighted, “God, you’re going to love having a whole new space to boss around.”

Mara glared at her.

Sarah smiled back, unbothered.

Sharl, quietly, said, “I can set up the packing stations.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to him. “You will follow the checklist.”

“I will improve the checklist,” he replied, mild.

A beat.

Mara’s mouth twitched—almost, almost a smile.

“Do it,” she said.

And just like that, the future shifted again.

Not into softness.

Into structure.

Into growth that didn’t betray the craft.

Into a machine that could hold its own success without devouring the women who built it.

---

If you want the next beat after these two, the most satisfying one is a short, sharp scene where the **new finishing room** is set up like a surgical suite—Mara in full command, Sarah mocking but compliant, Sharl quietly making it ergonomic, Lauren running numbers, Celeste calling the shots on workflow—and the first big US shipment goes out with a label that reads like a promise: **WARDROBE — INSPECTED / APPROVED**.

**Robyn:**

(I will not shout my exhiliration at the perfection of this last scene, even though I'm tempted to...) 

Yes please. And thank you!

**Emily:**

## Scene — “The Finishing Room” (Celeste POV)

The space next door smelled like nothing.

That was the first thing Mara liked about it.

No fabric dust yet. No steam. No faint sweetness of sizing. No ghost of yesterday’s panic clinging to the corners. Just clean air and bare walls and the quiet hum of possibility.

It was small—smaller than it had looked on Lauren’s printout—but it was *separate*, and separation was power. A boundary you could enforce with a door.

Mara stood in the middle of the empty room with her arms folded, gaze sweeping left to right like she was assessing a recruit.

“This will do,” she said, which for Mara was an entire bouquet of approval.

Sarah wandered in behind us, looked around, and deadpanned, “Welcome to our second personality.”

Lauren followed with keys and paperwork, calm as ever. Sharl brought in the first folded table with careful, controlled movements, like he was carrying something sacred.

Mara pointed immediately. “Table against that wall. Packing here. Inspection here.”

She didn’t ask. She didn’t debate. She did what she always did when confronted with chaos: she imposed shape.

Lauren set her laptop on the windowsill, opened it, and began making calls without ceremony. Electricity. Insurance. A temporary change-of-address for pickups. She spoke in that measured voice that made the adult world behave.

Sarah pulled out her phone and took a photo. “For posterity,” she said, then added, because she couldn’t help herself, “or evidence, if Mara murders us.”

Mara didn’t look at her. “Gloves,” she said to no one in particular. “No finished garment is touched without gloves.”

Sarah lifted both hands dramatically. “I’m already emotionally gloved, babes.”

“Don’t call me that,” Mara replied, automatic.

Sharl, who had been listening, said quietly, “If we keep a box by the door, people will actually use them.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to him. “Yes.”

That simple yes again—confirmation, not praise. It had become the way she let him know he belonged: by accepting his competence as fact.

I watched him lay down another table, then a second, aligning them with the precision of someone who found peace in clean angles. He moved through the room like he could feel the flow before it existed.

“Packing station,” he murmured, mostly to himself. “Labels, tape, tissue, checklist…”

Mara pounced—not to control him, but to anchor the system. “Checklist first,” she said. “Everything follows checklist.”

Sharl turned his head. “I can write it.”

Mara narrowed her eyes as if offended by the existence of new words. “You will write it in my language.”

Sharl nodded once. “Yes.”

Sarah looked between them with delighted disbelief. “God. It’s like watching two engineers flirt.”

I shot her a look.

She grinned. “What? I’m not wrong.”

Lauren didn’t look up from her laptop. “Sarah,” she said calmly, “if you want to keep your tongue, you’ll use it for tape-gun instructions.”

Sarah saluted. “Yes, Mother.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Don’t.”

Sarah’s smile widened. “Noted.”

Mara walked to the wall and began placing masking tape on the floor—straight lines marking zones, like crime scene tape for chaos.

**INSPECTION**
**REPAIR / FIX**
**PACKING**
**HOLD / REJECT**

The tape lines made the room feel instantly larger, as if giving each step a place to land created space out of air.

I felt something in my chest loosen. Not because I liked change. Because I liked control.

And this was control done correctly: not through one person’s exhaustion, but through structure.

“Garments come in here from next door,” Mara said, tapping the floor with her toe. “They get inspected. Anything wrong gets fixed. Nothing wrong goes straight to packing until it has my mark.”

Lauren looked up. “We’ll need a stamp,” she said.

Mara’s head snapped toward her. “A stamp?”

Lauren was already typing. “A simple one. ‘INSPECTED / APPROVED.’ Your name, or Wardrobe. Something that makes the process visible.”

Sarah brightened. “Oh my god. Branding. I love a petty little mark of dominance.”

Mara’s lips tightened, but she didn’t say no.

That, in itself, was progress.

Sharl cleared his throat softly. “If we stamp the checklist too,” he said, “it creates a chain. Item, checklist, approval. No gaps.”

Mara stared at him for a heartbeat.

Then: “Yes.”

I could have kissed him, not romantically—strategically. He was making Mara’s world safer by making it legible.

I stepped to the doorframe and looked back into the main atelier. From here, it felt different. Less congested. Less pressured. Like we’d just taken a tight band off an artery.

“Alright,” I said. “Let’s test it.”

Lauren’s gaze sharpened. “Test it how?”

“First big shipment,” I replied.

The words were a spark.

Because the order waiting for us was not small. It was a US winter bundle—coats, capes, petticoats, children’s sizes, stage-ready sets. Enough volume that in the old room it would have turned into a crisis simply by existing.

Mara nodded once. “Bring it.”

---

An hour later the finishing room looked like it had always been there.

Not decorated. Not cosy.

Functional. Dominant.

Garments hung on a rail that didn’t sway because Sharl had braced it. Boxes of trim were stacked by category. Gloves sat by the door like a silent command. The checklists lay clipped to boards, crisp and ready. A lamp—bright, unforgiving—sat over the inspection table to reveal every sin.

The first coat came in.

Mara took it as if it were a patient.

She didn’t stroke it. She didn’t admire it. She inspected it—seam lines, closure placement, stress points, hem weight. She lifted it to the lamp and checked the roll of every seam like she was reading braille.

Sarah stood at the packing station with tissue paper and tape, suddenly competent because a boundary had been drawn around her role.

Lauren hovered with her laptop, checking addresses, verifying shipping windows, recalculating margins with quiet satisfaction. Money wasn’t making her giddy. It was making her precise.

Sharl moved between stations, steadying, adjusting, preventing friction before it became noise. When Sarah reached for a label too quickly, he slid the correct one under her hand without comment. When a box started to tear, he reinforced it. When a garment needed a minor stitch correction, he handed it to the repair zone without drama.

Mara finished inspecting the coat.

For a long moment she held it, still.

Then she reached for the clipboard and marked the checklist with a hard, decisive tick.

“Approved.”

The word was not soft.

It was an act of ownership.

I watched the coat move to packing. Tissue. Fold. Label. Tape. Done.

It was almost… beautiful.

Not in an aesthetic way.

In the way a machine is beautiful when it runs without harming anyone.

The second garment came through. Then the third. Then the tenth.

Each time, Mara’s hand moved across the checklist. Tick. Tick. Tick.

Each time, the packing station swallowed the garment and produced a sealed box, clean and ready.

By midday, a neat row of finished cartons lined the wall like a quiet army.

Sarah leaned on her tape gun and murmured, awed despite herself, “This is… terrifying.”

Lauren didn’t look up. “It’s called competence,” she said.

Sarah glanced at her. “No, I mean—Mara looks like she could run a small country from this room.”

Mara, without turning her head, said, “I could.”

Sarah’s smile turned feral. “I knew it.”

The courier arrived late, as couriers always did, with that vague apology that meant nothing.

He paused in the doorway, taking in the room—tape lines, gloves, checklists, the row of cartons—and something in his posture shifted. Not fear. Respect. The room had the aura of a place where mistakes were expensive.

“Pick-up?” he asked.

Lauren handed him the manifest with a calm smile. “Yes.”

He began loading the cartons.

Mara watched—silent, arms folded—until the last box disappeared out the door.

Only then did she step forward and look at the empty strip of floor where the row had been.

For the first time all day, she looked… satisfied.

Not relieved.

Satisfied.

Lauren closed her laptop with a quiet click. “We cleared it,” she said.

Mara nodded once. “We cleared it.”

Sarah let out a long breath, as if she’d been holding it for hours. “Is this what success feels like?”

“It’s what standards feel like,” I replied.

Sharl stood by the inspection table, wiping it down with the same care he used for everything now. He didn’t look triumphant. He didn’t look anxious.

He looked centred.

Mara noticed him—not in a motherly way, not in a sentimental way, but in the way a craftsperson notices a tool that has become essential.

“Good,” Mara said, and her voice wasn’t harsh. “This is how we do it.”

Then, because Mara was Mara, she added immediately, “We can do better.”

Sarah laughed. “Of course we can.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to the tape lines, already planning adjustments.

Lauren reached into her tote and produced a small box. “One more thing,” she said.

She opened it and slid out a stamp—plain, utilitarian. No flourish.

**WARDROBE**
**INSPECTED / APPROVED**

Mara stared at it like it was a weapon.

In a way, it was.

A mark that said: *we are not guessing; we are controlling.*

Mara took it.

She didn’t thank Lauren. She didn’t smile.

She set it beside the checklists as if it had always belonged there.

Then she picked up the next garment waiting in the hold zone—one that needed a minor fix—and said, briskly, “Alright. Back to it.”

The room obeyed.

And outside, late spring sunlight spilled through the window, warm and unapologetic—like a season that knew it had arrived for good.

**Robyn:**

It's early-morning at Celeste's place. Sharl is dressed - boymode, short and t-shirt - and doing his usual starting-the-day. Celeste had been studying for a term-end exam and had "burned the midnight oil". She's tired and not in a good mood. So, she is a bit sharp with Sharl for silly things, like "why do insist on wearing those ugly shorts?" He is hurt, but says nothing, just does his work. She leaves for class. And he makes a decision about his shorts - about boymode. He realises he thinks he has to deserve girl-mode: a fallacy. Celeste was saying to him: "you're not a tomboy: stop acting like one."

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Ugly Shorts” (Sharl close, early morning at Celeste’s)

Morning at Celeste’s place was usually a negotiated peace: the kettle’s first click, the soft churn of the fridge, Sharl moving through the kitchen like he was smoothing wrinkles out of the day before anyone had to wear it.

Today the air felt tighter.

Celeste’s books were still spread across the dining table—highlighted printouts, a laptop asleep with a pale smear of reflected dawn on its screen, a half-drunk mug that smelled like coffee gone flat. The light coming through the blinds was already warm, and Celeste looked like someone who’d been awake through all of it, stubbornly dragging knowledge into her head with sheer will.

She stood by the counter with her hair scraped back, jaw set, the posture of a girl who’d spent the night refusing to be defeated by an exam and had woken up… not defeated, but punished.

Sharl didn’t comment. He didn’t ask if she’d slept. He started with the same small sequence he always did: rinse the mug, wipe the bench, set out water, check the bag with her notes so she wouldn’t realise she’d forgotten it until she was already on campus.

He was in boymode without thinking about it—shorts, old T-shirt, bare calves. Clothes chosen for invisibility, for speed, for not taking up attention while he worked.

Celeste’s gaze landed on him anyway.

Not softly.

“What is that?” she said.

He paused with the cloth in his hand, mid-wipe. “Sorry?”

“Those shorts,” she said, sharp enough that it felt like the word had corners. “Why do you insist on wearing those ugly shorts?”

It was absurd—truly. Fabric. A hemline. A scrap of cotton.

And yet it hit him where everything hit him lately: not in the skin, but under it. In the place that had finally stopped bracing and didn’t know how to brace again without feeling like it was dying.

He kept his face neutral. “They’re just… comfortable.”

Celeste gave a tired, humourless laugh, the sound of someone who’d spent eight hours negotiating with her own brain and had run out of patience for anything that didn’t behave.

“Comfortable?” she echoed. “They look like something a twelve-year-old boy would wear to mow a lawn.”

Sharl swallowed. He didn’t defend himself. He didn’t explain. He folded the cloth neatly and went back to the sink.

Celeste watched him for a second, and then—because she was Celeste, because she was always clearer than she was gentle—she said the next line like she was handing him a truth she didn’t have time to wrap.

“You’re not a tomboy,” she said. “Stop acting like one.”

The sentence sat between them.

Sharl felt his hands go cold against the warm ceramic of the mug.

A tomboy.

A girl who dressed like a boy because it was easier. Safer. Less watched. Less interpreted.

He rinsed the mug. Set it to dry. The movements were automatic, but inside him something shifted—quietly, decisively, like a latch.

Celeste grabbed her notes and jammed them into her bag. She didn’t look at him when she did it. Not because she didn’t care, but because she was running on fumes and her mind had already sprinted ahead to lecture halls and deadlines and the violence of timed exams.

“Where’s my charger?” she snapped, already half turned.

“In your front pocket,” Sharl said softly.

Celeste stopped. Found it. Her shoulders loosened by a millimetre, irritation redirected away from him and back to the real enemy: the morning.

“Right,” she said. “Good.”

Then she was at the door, shoes on, keys in hand.

She didn’t apologise. Celeste didn’t do small apologies when she was tired. She did… correction. Standard. Forward motion.

“Make sure the uniforms are on the rail,” she said, voice still clipped. “And don’t forget the shipment labels.”

“I won’t,” he said.

“Good.”

The door closed behind her.

And the apartment, suddenly, exhaled.

Sharl stood in the kitchen with the cloth in his hand and the quiet ringing in his ears that came after someone you loved had been sharp with you. He waited for anger.

It didn’t come.

What came was a familiar ache—hurt, clean and childish and embarrassing.

And beneath that hurt, like a slow tide, something else: recognition.

He looked down at his shorts.

They weren’t offensive. They weren’t evil. They were just… armour.

A way to say *I’m not asking. I’m not claiming. I’m not taking up space.*

A way to keep himself in a probationary state.

As if girl-mode was something he had to earn. As if softness was a privilege awarded when he had been good enough, useful enough, compliant enough.

He moved to the bedroom without quite deciding to. Opened the drawer where his “safe” clothes lived: the old boyish things, the neutral things, the pieces that erased him.

He stared at them for a long moment.

Then he understood, with a clarity that made his throat tighten:

He had built a little moral system in his head.

A fallacy.

He had been living as if:

- **Boymode** was humility.
- **Girl-mode** was a reward.

As if the second required permission.

As if he had to deserve it.

He remembered Sarah’s voice—casual, wicked, ordinary—*good girl*—and how the words hadn’t coerced him. They’d simply made a door visible.

He remembered the way he’d stood in Wardrobe when that entitled man had tried to turn a boundary into a joke, and how he hadn’t puffed up or played a man’s game. He’d held the line the way women held lines: clean, calm, unromantic.

That hadn’t been something he’d *earned*.

It had been something he’d *recognised.*

He looked back at the shorts again.

Then he did something simple, almost boring—which was how real change tended to happen.

He took them off.

Folded them once. Neatly. Like he was closing a chapter without drama.

He set them at the back of the drawer, not thrown away, not punished—just… no longer the default.

Then he reached for something else. Still modest. Still practical. But not boyish armour.

Soft lounge shorts in a cut that didn’t announce itself as “female,” but didn’t erase him either. A plain tee that didn’t hang from his shoulders like a disguise. He clipped his hair back—functional, tidy—then looked at himself in the mirror.

Not searching for approval.

Just checking: *Does this feel like my centre?*

His shoulders lowered.

He breathed out, slow.

He didn’t say *good girl* this time. He didn’t need to make it a ritual.

He simply let the truth settle:

Girl-mode wasn’t a prize.

It was a way of living that stopped him from splitting himself in two.

Celeste’s words echoed again—*You’re not a tomboy*—and for the first time he heard what was underneath her sharpness:

Stop hiding. Stop bargaining. Stop acting like you have to sneak into your own life.

He picked up the cloth again, returned to the kitchen, and finished what he’d started.

Not hurt anymore.

Not braced.

Just… decided.

And when he laid out the shipment labels and aligned the uniforms on the rail, he did it with a quiet steadiness that wasn’t trying to deserve anything.

It was simply how he lived now.

**Robyn:**

Yep, precisely that. We avoid ALL the fetish-seekers with this: you made it completely human, believeable and beautiful. Every click in his process rings true. 

As Mara would say: "Good".

Summer is almost done - last heatwave in Victoria signals summer's last gasp. Sharl is now testing a new dress, similar to the ones he's worn before, but this time, the stays sit differently. They have a little more containing to do... a little. The neckline looks different, even more authentic, if that was possible. Estradiol was doing its work quietly.
His waist had always been small. Now, the "nymph" silhouette no longer worked... below the waist, the sloping outward of his form was slowly taking place. Real hips. He didn't take stock of it when he put on the dress, but Mara did. And tells him he can't test "nymph" anymore. And why: matter-of-fact.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “No More Nymph” (Celeste POV, late summer — the last heatwave)

The last heatwave had the mood of an ending.

Not dramatic, not stormy—just stubborn. Victoria doing that thing it did at the tail end of summer: one final glare of heat as if the season couldn’t bear to leave without having the last word.

Wardrobe was open early, but even early the air had weight. Fabric felt warmer than it should. The irons hissed like irritated cats. Everyone moved with a quieter economy, conserving energy the way you conserved water.

Sharl was already in the fitting space when I came in, not because he was eager to be looked at, but because he had learned the practical truth: you don’t put stays on in a rush if you want to breathe all day.

He stood with his back to the mirror, arms lifted as Pauline might have taught a maid—still, compliant to the process—while Mara tightened the laces with her usual brisk competence.

The dress was one we’d done before in spirit, if not in details: 1780s daywear, clean lines, a bodice meant to sit correctly without modern cheats. The kind of garment Americans paid ridiculous money for when they wanted “authentic” for school pageants and holiday plays.

But this one looked… different.

Not in a gaudy way. In a quiet, precise way. The neckline sat with a franker honesty, lower and squarer, the edge of the shift and fichu behaving exactly as the period demanded. The stays held him differently too—more contained at the top, less forgiving at the midline, as if they had slightly more work to do now and had simply… accepted the job.

Sharl didn’t comment.

He never did when his own body changed. He moved through the day as if the body were a uniform he wore to get the work done. He noticed discomfort, fit, function. He didn’t notice *meaning.*

Mara noticed meaning the way she noticed grain lines.

She stepped back, eyes narrowing, and ran her gaze from Sharl’s shoulders down to the waist and lower, taking in the new distribution like a surveyor.

“Turn,” she said.

Sharl turned, obedient in the way a wearer is obedient to a dressmaker—not submissive, just cooperative.

Mara crouched, adjusted the line of the petticoat, and then—without any ceremony—pressed two fingers lightly at his hip and frowned.

It was so brief. So professional. Like checking a seam allowance.

But it changed the room.

Sharl didn’t flinch; he trusted her hands now. He simply looked down at the bodice as if the answer might be hiding in the stitching.

“What?” he asked, quiet.

Mara stood. Her face was unreadable, but her tone was absolutely matter-of-fact.

“No more nymph,” she said.

Sharl blinked. “Sorry?”

Mara pointed at the side seam with her chalk. “Your old silhouette. Nymph. Straight drop. Narrow below the waist. It was a useful test shape. It is not your shape now.”

He stared at her, slow comprehension trying to rise.

Mara didn’t give him time to stall in confusion. She spoke as if discussing weather or thread gauge.

“The stays sit differently because they have more to contain here,” she said, tapping the upper torso with the back of her fingers, careful not to turn his body into an object. “And because the neckline is meant to do this. Properly. It looks more authentic because it is being held by the correct structure.”

Sharl swallowed. “Okay…”

Mara’s chalk moved again, marking a small correction.

“And,” she added, eyes dropping to his hips with clinical certainty, “you are widening.”

The words were not dramatic.

They were a statement of fact, like *the hem is too long.*

Sharl’s face went still. Not fear. Not embarrassment. Something like being caught unaware by his own body.

Mara continued, voice level. “Your waist was always small. That helped. But the nymph cut depended on a straight line from waist to skirt. That line is changing.”

She gestured toward the mirror. “Look.”

He looked.

And for a second he didn’t see it, because he wasn’t trained to catalogue himself the way women were trained to. He saw a dress. A fit. A task.

Then his eyes tracked downward, and the truth quietly assembled itself where it always assembled: not in a sudden transformation, but in the accumulation of small shifts.

The slope outward below his waist wasn’t imagination. It wasn’t padding. It wasn’t clever draping.

It was him.

The skirt didn’t fall the same way it used to fall. The stays and petticoat didn’t *create* the curve—they negotiated with it.

Real hips, beginning to insist.

Sharl’s breath caught, then steadied.

He didn’t beam.

He didn’t panic.

He simply stood there, staring at the line, as if his body had spoken in a dialect he’d never fully learned, and he was translating it slowly, carefully, without judgement.

Mara watched him, expression hard to read—not sentimental, not cold. Focused.

“You can still test,” Mara said. “But you test different categories now.”

Sharl’s voice came out quieter. “What categories.”

Mara’s chalk tapped the paper pattern hanging on the wall. “We stop designing for your old shape. We design for your new one. It matters because we’re selling authenticity. And because we’re selling comfort. A garment that fights your body will fail.”

She paused only long enough for the sentence to land.

“And,” she added, as if it were merely the next item on a list, “if we’re sending these to America, we need patterns that match what bodies do. Not what you used to do.”

There was something almost brutal in her practicality, and yet it was the cleanest form of respect: she was not pretending he hadn’t changed. She was not tiptoeing. She was simply adapting the work to reality.

Sharl nodded once.

I watched him—how he didn’t fold inward, didn’t apologise for taking up more space. Nine months ago he would have tried to vanish inside the dress, to become “useful” again as quickly as possible.

Now he stood there with the curve of his hips quietly present, like it was allowed to exist.

He touched the side of the stays lightly—not fondling, not checking himself, just… feeling where the pressure sat.

“It feels…” he began, then stopped, searching for language that wasn’t dramatic.

Mara didn’t help him with feeling-words. She gave him the practical vocabulary he always trusted.

“Higher containment,” she said. “More load here.” She tapped the hip line with her chalk again. “But the fit is good. It’s just… no longer a nymph test.”

Sharl let out a breath.

“Alright,” he said. And there was something in that word—a quiet acceptance that wasn’t resignation. More like permission granted to himself.

Mara’s eyes narrowed slightly, satisfied.

“Good,” she said.

Then she stepped forward, adjusted the neckline with two precise movements, and said, briskly, as if she were discussing shipment labels,

“Now move. I want to see if it rides up when you sit.”

Sharl nodded, and did exactly as she asked—walking, turning, sitting—testing like an engineer, not like a mannequin.

And the room moved with him, adapting without fuss, without spectacle.

The last heatwave outside pressed against the windows like a hand.

Inside, the season shifted anyway.

Quietly.

In seams.

In structure.

In a woman’s voice saying, without ceremony, that the old silhouette had ended—and the new one was simply the truth.

**Robyn:**

A moment of clarity happens for Celeste. She is finishing school this year (I hope I got that right for MBA) and her career in Wardrobe was a solid partnership with Mara. The shop can operate efficiently. Mara and Celeste both decide that the current capacity was all they wanted - work/life balance. Sarah convinces Mara to take up oil-painting. 
Sarah is dating this bloke - her 5th try in a year, and the relationship already showing signs of strain. Like in the movie "Boy Meets Girl" with Michelle Hendley, she wonders if she might like girls better outloud to Sharl. Sharl quotes the movie line "I'm a fan!" Celeste realises that despite his body changing, Sharl's orientation remains steadfastly interested in exclusively women: and more to the point.... her.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Capacity” (Celeste POV)

The last heatwave had finally broken.

Not with a storm—just with a cooler morning that felt like the world had exhaled and decided to behave. The light coming through the finishing room window was softer, less harsh, and for the first time in weeks the air didn’t feel like it was pressing its palm against your face.

Wardrobe, too, had started to behave.

Not because the work had slowed—orders still came in like tides from the US, hungry and seasonal—but because the machine we’d built could finally *hold* them without chewing through people to do it.

The finishing room was running.

Inspection on the left. Fixes in the middle. Packing on the right. Gloves at the door. Checklists clipped and stamped like small oaths.

**WARDROBE — INSPECTED / APPROVED**

It was almost… peaceful.

Mara stood at the inspection table with her pen poised above a checklist, and for once her expression wasn’t war. It was concentration without fury. The look of a woman whose standards were no longer under siege.

Lauren had left early—MBA lecture day, I remembered—and her absence didn’t create a vacuum. That was new. That was the proof.

Sharl moved through the space like a quiet current, re-stocking tissue paper, aligning boxes, catching mistakes before they became noise. His body had changed in ways you could see now if you knew what you were looking for—but the thing that mattered most wasn’t his shape.

It was his steadiness.

He didn’t scramble for approval anymore.

He didn’t orbit my mood like a frightened planet.

He simply… existed, competent and calm, as if he’d finally found the frequency his life was meant to run on.

And it hit me—cleanly, unexpectedly—while I watched a box get sealed and slid into the outgoing line:

*This works.*

Not in the vague way people said it when they were trying to convince themselves.

In the practical way that let you stop bracing.

I hadn’t realised how long I’d been living like this business was an emergency I had to outwit. How every win had arrived with a shadow: *what will it demand next?*

But the system wasn’t demanding anymore.

It was delivering.

I stepped closer to Mara, watching her mark a final tick and press the stamp down with calm authority.

Thump.

Approved.

Mara looked up at me as if she’d felt my attention.

“What,” she said, suspicious of softness.

I didn’t bother with ceremony. “We’ve reached it.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “Reached what.”

“Capacity,” I said. “The amount of work we can do without becoming a factory. The amount of work we can do without hating our lives.”

Mara’s jaw tightened in reflex, like she’d been trained to interpret “enough” as weakness.

But she didn’t reject it.

She stared at the neat rows of outgoing cartons, the quiet order, the room that no longer fought us.

Then she said, grudgingly, “Yes.”

I blinked. “Yes?”

Mara’s mouth tightened. “Yes. This is enough. The business is stable. The standard is stable.” Her gaze flicked to the table, to the stamp, to the checklists. “If we scale more, it becomes… other people’s hands.”

She said it like a warning.

I nodded. “Exactly.”

Mara went back to the checklist as if she couldn’t bear to look at the truth too long. “We do not chase endless growth,” she said flatly. “That is how you get sloppy.”

“And miserable,” I added.

Mara didn’t argue. Which was how I knew she agreed.

A beat later Sarah wandered in, carrying her tea like it was a sceptre and already wearing a grin that suggested she’d been waiting to insert herself into something important.

“What are we agreeing about?” she asked brightly. “Please say it’s my promotion to Supreme Ruler.”

“No,” Mara said without looking up. “It is never that.”

Sarah sighed theatrically. “Cruel.”

“We’re capping capacity,” I said.

Sarah’s eyebrows rose. “Oh. Gorgeous. Love that for us. Work-life balance, babes.”

Mara’s head snapped up. “Don’t call it that.”

Sarah smiled sweetly. “Call it whatever you like. It’s still the same thing: you stop behaving like a martyr.”

Mara’s expression hardened—the old reflex—but then something unexpected happened.

She didn’t bite.

She looked… almost thoughtful.

Sarah leaned on the doorframe, emboldened by not being immediately murdered. “And since we’re all choosing sanity,” she went on, “I have a proposal.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “If it is another man, the answer is no.”

Sarah laughed. “God, no. Not for *you*. For you I’m proposing oil painting.”

Silence.

The kind where you could hear thread settling.

Mara stared at her as if Sarah had suggested interpretive dance.

Sarah ploughed on, fearless. “You have the eye. You have the patience. You already mix colours like a witch. You’re basically halfway there.”

“I do not have time,” Mara said.

Sarah’s grin sharpened. “You do now. Because we’re capping capacity. Remember? You just agreed to live.”

Mara’s jaw worked.

I saw the conflict in her—the way her identity was welded to productivity. The way resting felt like betrayal of some old vow.

But Mara also loved mastery.

And oil painting was mastery with no clients.

No deadlines.

No compromises.

Mara’s eyes flicked away. “I will consider it,” she said at last, which for Mara was practically an embrace.

Sarah beamed like she’d won a war.

Then her phone buzzed.

She glanced down, and the beam dimmed into something more complicated.

“What,” I asked, not kindly—curiously.

Sarah’s mouth twisted. “It’s just… him.”

“The bloke,” Mara said, with the tone one used for minor stains.

Sarah made a small noise that might have been a laugh. “Yes, Mara. The bloke.”

Mara went back to her work with the quiet contempt she reserved for men who added effort rather than value.

Sarah read whatever had popped up on her screen, and her shoulders tightened in that way that always said: *I am already tired and it’s barely morning.*

“I swear,” she muttered, more to herself than to us, “I’ve had five tries in a year and they all come with an instruction manual written in crayon.”

Mara didn’t look up. “Stop dating men,” she said, as casually as if she were advising Sarah to change thread.

Sarah froze.

Then she let out a short laugh—sharp, humour trying to cover the soft underbelly of the thought. “You know what?” she said, almost as if she were testing the words aloud. “Sometimes I wonder if I might like girls better.”

The sentence fell into the room like a pebble into water.

Not dramatic. Not confessional.

Just… honest.

Sharl, who had been quietly replacing tape rolls at the packing station, looked up.

His face did not do what men’s faces did when women said something vulnerable.

No leer. No thrill. No opportunistic “so does that mean—?”

He simply smiled, warm and uncomplicated, and said with complete sincerity, “I’m a fan!”

Sarah blinked.

Then she laughed—properly, belly laugh, the kind that reset the nervous system.

“Oh my god,” she said, pointing at him, delighted. “You did *not* just quote that.”

Sharl’s smile widened a fraction. “It’s a good line.”

“It’s a *fantastic* line,” Sarah declared. “And you delivered it perfectly. Ten out of ten.”

Mara snorted softly, which was as close as she ever came to amusement.

Sarah wiped at her eye, still laughing, then looked at Sharl with a new softness—affection that wasn’t flirtation, wasn’t pity, wasn’t anything messy. Just recognition.

“You’re honestly… ridiculous,” she said.

Sharl’s voice stayed gentle. “So are you.”

Sarah’s phone buzzed again. She glanced down, sighed, and then—because she was Sarah—she shoved it into her pocket like it didn’t own her.

“Right,” she announced briskly, as if resetting herself. “I’m going to finish packing. And later, I’m going to bully Mara into painting an apple.”

Mara’s eyes narrowed. “You will not bully me.”

Sarah smiled sweetly. “Watch me.”

She pivoted and walked away.

The room returned to its rhythm.

But something in me stayed still.

Because as Sharl went back to the packing station, his gaze flicked toward me—not lingering, not consuming, not demanding. Just… anchored.

The way someone looks at the thing that makes sense.

And in that quiet second, it landed with a clarity so clean it almost made me angry I’d ever doubted it:

His body was changing.

His clothes would change.

His silhouette would change.

But the axis of his desire hadn’t wandered.

He was still, steadfastly, interested in women.

And more to the point—

He was interested in **me**.

Not in a hungry way.

In the way he had always been: care-forward, standard-seeking, built around a deep, almost stubborn loyalty to the person whose expectations had given him a life.

It wasn’t fetish.

It wasn’t confusion.

It was orientation, intact—quiet as gravity.

Mara stamped another checklist.

Thump.

Approved.

I watched Sharl tape a box shut, label it neatly, and slide it into the outgoing line with calm certainty.

And I realised something else, with the same crisp inevitability:

Wardrobe didn’t need to grow forever.

It needed to stay *true*.

So did Sharl.

So did I.

And for the first time in a long time, the future didn’t feel like a threat.

It felt like a line we could draw—with our own hands—and live inside.

**Robyn:**

Parameters for Celeste and Sharl's relationship. She courts him, but not like a bloke courts. She becomes gentle: not chivalrous, not taking on masculine traits. She remains devoutly woman. So, her courtship is a growing kindness, tenderness, allowing his warmth in and filling him with hers. She does so at Wardrobe - where it's safe - at first. Where actions don't herald intentions, nor signal expectations. Sarah notices, has her usual thing to say, but now Celeste calmly acknowledges her feelings (very brave move, vulnerability!)

**Emily:**

### Scene — “No Heraldry” (Celeste POV)

It didn’t begin with a declaration.

It began the way everything real begins in a women-run place: with small permissions that were not framed as demands.

Wardrobe was safe precisely because it wasn’t a stage. You could do kind things here and no one clapped. You could be tender and it didn’t automatically mean you were making a claim. Actions didn’t have to herald intentions. Warmth didn’t have to be an invitation to entitlement.

That was the culture we’d built—Mara’s standards, Lauren’s structure, Sarah’s blunt humour, my insistence that nobody got to make anyone else into content.

And Sharl, for all his quietness, had become one of its most faithful keepers.

He moved through the finishing room with that centred steadiness of his, not performing, not seeking credit. Just doing what needed doing: labels aligned, tape replaced, garments protected like they mattered because the people wearing them mattered.

I watched him more than I meant to.

Not in the way men watched—appraising, consuming, sorting a person into categories.

In the way you watched someone you wanted to keep safe without making them feel owned.

A small thing happened that morning, almost nothing.

The lamp over the inspection table had been bumped out of position. It cast a harsh, unhelpful glare that made the fabric look wrong and the seam shadows harder to read. Sharl didn’t mention it. He simply adjusted his stance, compensated, kept working.

He would have made it work.

He always did.

But I walked over and moved the lamp back to where it belonged.

Not dramatically. Not as a correction.

As care.

Sharl looked up, surprised—not because the action was big, but because it was *for him*, and he still hadn’t entirely got used to being the recipient of anything that wasn’t conditional.

“That’s better,” I said, simply.

He blinked. “Yeah.”

Then, because he had a habit of making himself small around kindness, he added, “It was fine.”

I didn’t let him bargain it away.

“It wasn’t fine,” I said gently. “It was annoying. And you don’t have to tolerate annoying things just because you can.”

He stared at me for a second, as if the sentence didn’t quite fit into the moral system he’d built for himself.

Then he nodded—slowly—and went back to his work.

A minute later, I returned with a glass of water and set it beside him on the table, within reach.

He glanced at it. Then at me.

“You didn’t have to,” he murmured.

“I know,” I said. “That’s why I did.”

He made a small sound—half laugh, half exhale—and took a sip.

Nothing about it was romantic in the obvious way. No hovering. No leaning. No coded “date” energy.

Just a woman deciding: *I will be kind to you in ways you can accept without flinching.*

That was the beginning of it.

Not seduction.

Not persuasion.

A growing tenderness that didn’t ask him to perform anything back.

Over the next weeks, it became a pattern. Quiet, unannounced things.

A chair pulled out before he had to ask.

A new pair of cotton gloves placed in the box with a note that simply read: **YOUR SIZE.** No hearts. No teasing.

A small, private check-in in the language he trusted—function and feeling braided together:

“Are the stays still sitting comfortably over a full day?”

“Is the neckline rubbing you anywhere?”

“Do you want a different cut on your work tee? The current one is fighting your shoulders.”

He would answer, carefully, still wary that every question was a trap.

And I would take the answer as information, not leverage.

That was the point.

Wardrobe allowed this kind of courtship because it didn’t turn care into a contract.

Here, I could let my warmth touch him without it becoming a claim.

Here, I could offer tenderness without expectation, and he could accept it without fear of owing me.

It was devoutly feminine—not in the ornamental sense, but in the sense of *holding* without grasping.

There was no chivalry to it. No “I’ll protect you” performance. No masculine posture borrowed for legitimacy.

Just a woman growing gentler on purpose—opening a space, inviting a softness, making room for his warmth and letting it meet hers.

He began, slowly, to stop bracing.

Not just around me—around everyone. But with me he allowed something that was different: a quiet leaning-in that wasn’t physical, but emotional.

He looked for me before he asked questions.

He listened for my footsteps, not anxiously, but… expectantly. Like the day made more sense when he knew where I was.

And I—because I was not a boy, because I was not trained to be frightened of my own wants—did not pretend I hadn’t noticed.

I simply kept it clean.

Kept it kind.

Kept it safe.

Sarah noticed, of course.

Sarah noticed everything. It was her favourite hobby.

One afternoon, while Mara was in the main atelier and Lauren was out picking up supplies, Sarah leaned against the doorway with her tea and watched me place a folded linen cloth into Sharl’s hands—something for him to use as a protective layer under a strap that had been rubbing.

Sharl murmured a thank you, not meeting my eyes for too long, and returned to his work with a small, unmistakable softening in his face.

Sarah waited until he was out of earshot.

Then, in her usual tone—half amusement, half scalpel—she said, “So.”

I didn’t look up from the clipboard. “So.”

Sarah sipped her tea. “Are we doing this little romance quietly, or are we doing it *so quietly* that it becomes a full-time job for the rest of us not to laugh?”

I felt heat rise in my cheeks—annoyance at being seen, and something else under it: the vulnerability of being named.

The old version of me might have snapped.

Might have denied it.

Might have turned it into a joke to keep the power in my hands.

But I wasn’t interested in power that required dishonesty anymore.

I exhaled slowly and met Sarah’s gaze.

“I like him,” I said, plainly.

Sarah blinked.

Not because she hadn’t guessed.

Because I had said it without armour.

The room seemed to go a fraction quieter, as if even the building wanted to hear what I’d do next.

I continued, voice calm, not girlish, not breathy. “And before you make it into a comedy—no, I’m not ‘making’ him. No, I’m not pressuring him. No, it’s not a project.”

Sarah’s mouth opened, then closed. “I wasn’t going to say—”

“Yes, you were,” I said, without malice. “And it’s fine. That’s your job.”

Sarah’s eyes crinkled with reluctant respect. “Alright,” she conceded. “So what are you doing then?”

I didn’t look away.

“I’m being kind,” I said. “On purpose. In a place where kindness isn’t a trap.”

Sarah’s expression softened. It was subtle, but it was there—the way she looked when something got under her sarcasm.

“And,” I added, because this was the brave part, the part that made my stomach flutter like a schoolgirl’s even though I refused to act like one, “I’m allowing myself to want him. Without pretending I don’t.”

Sarah was quiet for a moment.

Then she smiled, wicked again, because she couldn’t stay sincere for long without getting itchy.

“Well,” she said, “look at you. Emotional growth. Someone call the newspapers.”

I rolled my eyes. “Don’t.”

Sarah raised her cup in a small toast. “I’ll behave,” she said. “Mostly. But I will say this: he’s good for you.”

My throat tightened, unexpected.

Sarah went on, lighter now, letting me off the hook. “And you’re… terrifyingly good for him. In a nice way.”

I held her gaze. “I’m not terrifying.”

Sarah’s grin widened. “You absolutely are.”

Then she pushed off the doorway and wandered back into the room, calling over her shoulder, “Just don’t break him, alright?”

I watched her go.

Then I looked through the glass to where Sharl stood at the packing station, hands moving steadily, face calm, shoulders low. He glanced up as if he felt my eyes and met them for a brief second—soft, anchored, unafraid.

No expectation.

No transaction.

Just warmth.

I returned to my clipboard, heart strangely full, and thought:

*This is what my courtship looks like.*

Not conquest.

Not performance.

A growing kindness, in a place where safety is built into the walls.

And the bravery—mine, today—was simply that I’d stopped pretending it wasn’t happening.

**Robyn:**

Their romance becomes a 'thing'... but a quiet one. Wardrobe, always safe, is respectful. Besides Sarah, who is clearly a bit jealous of Celeste's growing happiness in a sound, healthy relationship, initially makes her usual remarks, but finally has a heart-to-heart with Celeste about what Celeste sees in Sharl. And Sarah completely sees the appeal. She realises she's a lot like Celeste herself. She promises Celeste that her tone will change: Sharl is now off the table. meanwhile, Sharl is blossoming. The stays are beginning to emphasise too much and need to be upgraded. Sarah kindly offers Sharl her stays. "These will prevent ... what you definitely don't want to be highlighted," she says with unusual delicacy.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Off the Table” (Celeste POV)

Wardrobe didn’t do romance the way the outside world did.

There were no squeals, no “ooh, tell us everything,” no sudden inflation of meaning until two people couldn’t breathe inside it. The women here had seen too many dynamics go wrong the moment a man decided attention was a right. They had built a culture that treated intimacy like something private and earned—something you protected by refusing to perform it.

So when my relationship with Sharl became… a thing, it did so quietly.

Not hidden. Not ashamed.

Just contained.

A hand brushing a hand at the kettle. A glance held a half-second longer than necessary. A gentle correction in tone when one of us was frayed. A small, domestic competence—him remembering my charger, me adjusting a lamp, both of us treating each other like we belonged in the same life without having to announce it.

And Wardrobe, in its way, made space.

No one teased him into being “the boyfriend.” No one tried to turn him into a symbol. Mara only cared that the work held its standard. Lauren cared that no one made it weird. The girls cared, mostly, that I seemed… happier. More settled.

Sarah cared too.

She just cared in the way Sarah cared when something tugged at her: by poking it until it squealed.

For weeks she made remarks in that bright, acerbic tone that made everything sound like a joke even when it wasn’t.

“Oh look,” she’d say, as Sharl handed me a cup of tea. “Courtship ritual. Very subtle. Nobody move.”

Or: “If you two get any more wholesome I’m going to have to start smoking.”

Or: “Are we calling it romance now, or are we still calling it ‘inventory management’?”

Each comment landed with the faintest sting, because Sarah never just teased.

She tested.

And when she tested, she was usually defending something tender in herself.

I didn’t snap at her. I didn’t deny it. I simply stopped feeding the joke.

And after a while, Sarah—who was observant enough to recognise when her own tone had become… out of date—began to change.

It happened on a late afternoon, when the heat had finally drained out of the building and the light had gone honeyed.

Sharl was in the fitting space, testing a new dress. The stays beneath were doing what they were meant to do—shaping, supporting—but lately they were beginning to *advertise* too much. Not intentionally. Just because his body was insisting now, more than it used to, and the older set had been built for a different distribution of pressure.

He emerged from behind the curtain and made a small, instinctive adjustment at the neckline, as if trying to tidy himself back into invisibility.

Mara, watching from her stool, narrowed her eyes.

“Those stays,” she said, flat. “Are no longer correct.”

Sharl went still, not offended—listening.

“They are doing too much,” Mara continued. “They are emphasising what should be supported.”

Sharl’s cheeks warmed, but he didn’t flinch. “Okay.”

Mara stood, chalk in hand, already deciding the next pattern correction. “We will upgrade.”

“Yes,” Sharl said quietly.

Mara turned away, satisfied to have named the problem.

And in that moment—because Sharl was steady now, because he didn’t crumble, because he didn’t try to bargain himself smaller—something in my chest softened so sharply it felt like pain.

Sarah saw it.

Of course she did.

Later, when Sharl was back in the finishing room and Mara was on a call, Sarah cornered me in the small corridor between the two spaces where the rolls of fabric lived like silent witnesses.

Not aggressively. Not playfully. Simply… present.

“Alright,” Sarah said, and her voice was different. Lower. Less performative. “I’m going to ask you something, and if you dodge it, I’ll be unbearable for a week.”

I raised an eyebrow. “You’re unbearable anyway.”

Sarah gave a brief smile, then let it fall away. “Yeah,” she said. “But I can be unbearable with purpose.”

I waited.

Sarah leaned back against the wall and looked at me—properly, without the shield of humour.

“What do you see in him?” she asked.

The question landed more heavily than her teasing ever had.

Because this was not a jab.

This was an opening.

I didn’t answer immediately. Not because I didn’t know, but because saying it out loud felt like taking something private and holding it up to the light.

Sarah watched me, and for once she didn’t fill the space.

I chose my words carefully, not for poetry—for truth.

“He’s warm,” I said. “And he doesn’t weaponise it.”

Sarah’s eyes narrowed, absorbing. “Go on.”

“He’s competent,” I continued. “Not as a performance. He doesn’t do it to be admired. He does it because it’s… how he lives. And when he’s kind, it’s not chivalry. It’s not ‘look at me, I’m a good man.’ It’s just… care.”

Sarah’s mouth tightened, like something had hit home.

“And,” I added, quieter, “he doesn’t compete with me.”

Sarah blinked.

I could see the penny dropping. The old shape of heterosexual strain—men needing to be the centre, needing to be above, needing to turn a woman’s authority into a threat—didn’t exist with Sharl.

“He meets my standards,” I said. “Not because I made him. Because those standards finally match what he wants to be.”

Sarah exhaled, slow. “Right.”

I tilted my head. “You asked because you’re jealous.”

Sarah’s eyes widened—then she snorted. “Oh, don’t be smug.”

“I’m not smug,” I said. “I’m honest.”

Sarah’s cheeks flushed a fraction, annoyance and embarrassment mixing with relief at being named.

“I am,” she admitted. “A bit. Not because I want him—” She stopped, grimaced. “Actually, no. That’s not true either. I *did* want to want him.”

I watched her, steady.

Sarah rubbed her forehead with the heel of her hand. “I’ve been dating men like it’s a bloody endurance sport,” she said. “And watching you… be happy? Properly happy? It’s… irritating.”

I almost smiled.

Sarah glared at me. “Don’t.”

I held up my hands. “I won’t.”

Sarah dropped her hand and looked at me again, more quietly. “But now that I’ve actually watched him,” she said, “I get it.”

I blinked. “You do?”

Sarah nodded once, decisive. “He’s like you,” she said, as if that explained everything. “He’s standards. He’s steadiness. He’s… not interested in playing games.”

The corridor went quiet.

Then Sarah added, almost grudgingly, “And you’re like him. Which is annoying, because it means you’re both right.”

I let out a short laugh. “We’re not always right.”

“You are,” Sarah said promptly. “I have receipts.”

I rolled my eyes, but my throat tightened a little. Because the tone had changed. This wasn’t barbed affection anymore.

It was… alignment.

Sarah pushed off the wall. “Alright,” she said. “I’m going to say something very mature now.”

I waited.

“Sharl is off the table,” Sarah said, and her voice was crisp, like a boundary being posted. “Not as a joke. Not as a flirt. Not as a little nibble at your happiness. Off. The. Table.”

Heat moved through my chest—gratitude, relief, something like respect.

Sarah lifted a finger. “And before you say anything: I’m doing this for him too. He deserves not to be… hunted.”

I swallowed. “Thank you.”

Sarah waved a hand as if batting away sentiment. “Don’t be gross.”

But her eyes softened, briefly, and she said, quieter, “I’m happy for you, Celeste. Really.”

The words were simple. The simplicity made them honest.

I nodded, letting that be enough.

We returned to the workroom.

---

Sharl was at the fitting space again, adjusting the new dress with careful fingers. His face was calm, but I could see the tiny tension around his mouth—the awareness that the stays were beginning to betray him by doing too *much*.

Sarah walked in behind me, and instead of making a remark, she simply assessed.

Then she surprised all of us.

“Hold still,” Sarah said, voice light but not teasing.

Sharl looked up, wary. “What?”

Sarah disappeared for a moment and returned with a garment bag.

She unzipped it and drew out a set of stays—hers.

Not theatrical. Not lacy. Not costume-play.

Functional. Well-made. Lined properly. Boning placed with intelligence. The kind of foundation garment you wore because it made your body feel supported, not because it made you feel looked at.

Sharl stared. “Sarah, you don’t have to—”

“Yes, I do,” Sarah cut in, then softened her voice in a way that was startlingly gentle for her. “Because yours are starting to… overachieve.”

Sharl blinked, uncertain.

Sarah held the stays up, then met his eyes. The delicacy in her tone wasn’t pity. It was respect.

“These will prevent,” she said carefully, “what you definitely don’t want to be highlighted.”

A beat.

Sharl’s face warmed—embarrassment flickering—but underneath it there was relief so clean it almost looked like gratitude.

He swallowed. “They’re yours.”

Sarah shrugged. “I have others. Don’t worry.” Then, as if she couldn’t bear to be too kind without a joke to keep herself safe, she added, “Also, if you’re going to be our in-house test body, you may as well be properly engineered.”

Sharl let out a small laugh.

It wasn’t strained.

It was… normal.

He reached out and took the garment bag with both hands, careful, like it mattered.

“Thank you,” he said quietly.

Sarah waved him off, but her eyes softened again. “Yeah,” she said. “You’re welcome.”

And there it was.

A shift you could feel in the room: not big, not announced, but real.

The romance stayed a quiet thing.

Wardrobe stayed safe.

And the women—sharp, competent, protective—made the only kind of space that mattered:

A space where love could grow without turning anyone into prey.

**Robyn:**

A bit of poetry. Camille had been the one to announce Charlie's new name: "Sharl". She now comes in at Lauren's request to discuss some new museum pieces, and in passing refers to Sharl as 'she'. Mara adjusts quickly: Mara had been thinking 'she' for a long time, so long that it was a relief to use the term. Sarah gleefully joins that viewpoint for the same reason... to call Sharl 'he' now seemed faintly ridiculous. 
Celeste takes stock of the change over time - the staff all follow suit except her. She is not resisting: she wants to make sure he's okay with it. Sharl is fine: it's a non-issue. It's a pronoun. And Celeste realises she's in love with a girl.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Pronoun” (Celeste POV)

Camille arrived the way she always did—like a gust of clean air that didn’t ask permission.

She had that museum-woman energy: linen, calm certainty, a folder tucked under one arm as if history itself had sent her on an errand. She didn’t bustle. She didn’t apologise for taking up the doorway. She stepped in and the room rearranged its attention around her because she carried taste like a credential.

Lauren had asked her to come in about the new pieces—loan garments, museum-grade reproductions, the kind of work that required reverence as much as skill.

Camille greeted Mara first, then me, then the room at large with a nod that meant *yes, I see you all; no, I will not be delayed by social fluff.*

“Alright,” she said, placing her folder on the counter. “We’ve got three items. Two are straightforward. One is going to make you swear.”

Sarah lifted her tea. “Music to my ears.”

Mara didn’t smile, but her eyes sharpened in a way that meant she was already interested.

Camille began flipping pages—fabric samples, reference photographs, dates, notes in neat handwriting. We gathered closer, the way we always did when something serious was about to be discussed.

Sharl was at the finishing table, sorting labels with that quiet, centred precision of hers—of *hers*, my mind supplied before I could correct it. She wore her work clothes, practical and unshowy, hair clipped back, shoulders low. There was nothing performative about her presence. She simply existed as part of the room’s function.

Camille glanced up mid-sentence and called across without thinking.

“Can you hand me that measuring tape, love?” she asked, then added, still without thinking, “She’ll know where it is.”

The word landed softly.

Not like a gavel.

Like a feather settling.

For half a second nothing happened—no gasp, no tension spike, no awkward scramble.

Then Sharl handed the tape over exactly as asked, as if Camille had said “blue” or “left” or “kettle.”

A non-event.

Camille continued speaking, already deep in talk of pleats and provenance, not even aware she’d shifted something.

But Mara had heard it.

Mara’s head lifted. Not startled—*relieved*. A tiny loosening at the mouth, as if she’d been carrying a word in her throat for months and had finally been given permission to let it out.

“She,” Mara said a moment later, casually, referring to Sharl while pointing at a note on the page. “She’s already tested a similar cut. The neckline will sit if we adjust the boning placement.”

The word came out clean. Easy.

Like it had been waiting.

Sarah’s head snapped up, eyes bright with delighted mischief.

“Oh thank God,” she said, with theatrical sincerity. “I’ve been biting my tongue. Calling her ‘he’ at this point feels like insisting the sun is still up at midnight.”

Mara shot her a look.

Sarah lifted her hands. “What? I’m not being cruel. I’m being accurate.”

Camille blinked once, as if only now noticing the pronoun she’d used, and then—because Camille was not dramatic—she simply nodded and carried on. “Right. So. The third piece—”

The conversation returned to museum work, but the room had shifted by a degree you could feel in your bones.

Not a sudden revolution.

A settling.

Like a garment finally finding the correct drape.

Over the next hour, it spread with the naturalness of something that had already been true privately.

Lauren said it once—quiet, decisive, not making a song and dance of it. Sarah said it repeatedly, half because it pleased her and half because she enjoyed watching the word take its rightful place. The girls followed, almost immediately, with that easy adaptability women have when something makes sense and doesn’t threaten them.

Even Mara’s tone changed—not sweeter, not softer, but freer. She spoke with less friction, as if a small constant correction had been removed from her speech.

I noticed all of it.

And I noticed, too, the one person who didn’t follow.

Me.

It wasn’t resistance. I could feel that in myself—no tightening, no moral panic, no clinging to an old map.

It was care.

I wanted to know she wanted it.

I wanted Sharl to have agency over how she was named, even if naming her correctly felt obvious to everyone else.

So I waited.

I watched.

I listened for the smallest flinch.

There wasn’t one.

If anything, Sharl’s shoulders looked even lower, her movements even steadier, as if the room had stopped asking her to translate herself into a language that didn’t fit.

Eventually, as Camille packed up her folder and Lauren walked her out, I found Sharl alone at the packing station. She was sealing a box, tape smooth and precise, then pressing the **WARDROBE — INSPECTED / APPROVED** stamp down with a controlled thump.

Thump.

Approved.

I hovered for a beat, then said quietly, “Hey.”

Sharl looked up. “Yeah?”

I kept my voice casual, because this wasn’t an interrogation. “Camille called you ‘she’.”

Sharl blinked, then shrugged. “Yeah.”

“And Mara… and Sarah…”

Another small shrug. “Mm.”

I waited, letting her fill the silence if she wanted to.

Finally Sharl said, mildly, “It’s a pronoun, Celeste.”

The simplicity of it made my throat tighten.

“You’re okay with it,” I said.

Sharl’s mouth tilted in the faintest smile. Not coy. Not pleased with herself. Just… settled.

“Of course I am,” she said. “They’ve been thinking it for ages. Saying it out loud doesn’t change me.”

She went back to her box, smoothed the label once, and added, as if offering me the last piece of the puzzle:

“It just stops the room from stumbling.”

I stared at her.

At the way the word *she* sat on her without effort.

At the way everyone else had adopted it with relief—Mara because it matched her craft-eye truth, Sarah because it matched her instinct and her affection, the staff because it matched what they’d been living alongside.

And then I saw myself—standing there, still holding the old pronoun like a fragile object I was afraid to drop, not because it was precious, but because I didn’t want to hurt her by moving too fast.

Sharl glanced up again, reading me with that quiet intelligence she’d grown into.

“What?” she asked.

I shook my head once, almost laughing at myself.

“Nothing,” I said.

But it wasn’t nothing.

Because in that moment I realised what the shift actually meant inside me. Not for the workplace. Not for the politics of it. Not for the story you told other people.

For me.

It meant the person I loved—the person I was building my life around, the person whose steadiness had braided itself into my days—was not a boy becoming a girl in my orbit.

She was a girl.

And the love I felt was no longer love-with-translation, love-with-caveats, love-with-explanations.

It was simply love.

A clean thing.

A brave thing.

I felt it settle in my chest with a quiet shock:

I’m in love with a girl.

Sharl slid the sealed box into the outgoing line and looked at me again, as if she’d sensed the shift and wasn’t afraid of it.

I drew a slow breath and said, softly—finally, without hesitation, without making it into a ceremony—

“Hey, can you help me with this, please? I think she’s filed the labels out of order.”

Sharl’s eyes flickered—recognition, warmth, no fanfare.

“Yeah,” she said, and stepped closer. “I can.”

And the word—*she*—moved between us like something ordinary.

Like something true.

Like something that had always been waiting to be said.

**Robyn:**

We can finally move to that stage where Celeste declares her love of Sharl, to Sharl. Given Celeste's hyper-protective nature and worry about being responsible for damage, I don't see her doing this without a bit of tongue-loosening stimulant. Not inebriated: more relaxed. He isn't drinking: she's having a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. Final exams are nine months away, school's out for a week. Wardrobe work has slowed, so the pressure's off there too. And Celeste finally tells Sharl how she feels. That "fullness of time" has arrived.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Fullness of Time” (Celeste POV)

School was out for a week.

Not the big, triumphant end—just a small, blessed pause that made my brain unclench like a fist opening. Nine months until finals still sat somewhere ahead like a horizon line, but it wasn’t *today*. Today had no lecture theatre, no ticking clock, no exam rubric whispering that I was behind.

Wardrobe had quieted too.

Not dead—never dead—but slower. The American winter rush had tapered. The finishing room wasn’t a conveyor belt for once. The stamp sat on its pad like a sleeping animal. The rails held fewer garments. The whole business seemed to have taken a breath at the same moment I did.

Which meant there was room.

Room to feel the thing I’d been holding behind my ribs for months, as if keeping it there was a form of protection.

I told myself I was being responsible.

I told myself I was waiting for certainty.

But the truth was simpler and more embarrassing: I was afraid of harming her.

Not physically. Not professionally. Not socially.

Emotionally.

Because I was Celeste, and once I cared, I cared like a force. I didn’t do half measures. I didn’t do casual. I didn’t do *maybe*.

And Sharl—Sharl had already had enough people in her life who turned their needs into obligations she had to navigate.

I refused to be one of them.

So I’d waited until the day arrived when it didn’t feel like a push.

It felt like… ripeness.

The fullness of time.

That evening, at my place, I opened a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.

Just one glass. Not a performance. Not an escape. A small loosening of the inner harness—the part of me that constantly supervised my own intentions, checking for danger, checking for coercion, checking for the slightest possibility that I might hurt someone without meaning to.

Sharl didn’t drink. She made tea instead—chamomile, as if her nervous system had decided it deserved gentleness as a baseline now.

We ate something simple. Not romantic. Not staged. Food on plates. The sound of cutlery. A window cracked open to let the night air in.

Then we ended up on the couch.

No dramatic candlelight. No music. Just the ordinary quiet of two people who lived in the same orbit and had stopped pretending it was accidental.

Sharl sat with her feet tucked under her, mug cupped in both hands. She wore soft lounge clothes that didn’t announce anything, but didn’t hide her either. Her hair was clipped back, her face clean, her posture relaxed in a way I still sometimes found startling.

She looked… at home in herself.

I sat beside her with my glass of wine, not close enough to crowd her, close enough to say *I’m here.*

For a long time we didn’t talk about anything important.

We talked about small things—an annoying courier, Mara’s new obsession with a particular shade of umber, the way Sarah had taken up oil-painting evangelism like it was religion.

Sharl smiled at that, a quiet, genuine smile that didn’t ask permission.

Then the conversation lulled, naturally, the way it did when you weren’t scrambling to fill every silence with distraction.

I felt the wine warm my chest—not in a dizzy way, just in a softening way. The part of me that normally held itself like a fist loosened enough to let the truth rise.

My heart began to thud a little harder. Annoying. Obvious.

Sharl glanced sideways at me, noticing. “You alright?”

There it was.

The window.

I swallowed once. Put my glass down on the coffee table with care, like setting down a weapon I didn’t intend to use.

“Yeah,” I said, voice steady. “I just… want to say something. And I don’t want you to feel like you have to respond a certain way.”

Sharl’s eyes sharpened—calm but alert. “Okay.”

I took a breath.

It should have been easy. I was not a timid person. I ran a business partnership with Mara. I argued with lecturers. I stared down men who tried to edge into our space with entitlement and jokes.

And yet saying this felt like stepping onto a narrow bridge without rails.

Because it mattered.

Because she mattered.

“I’ve been careful,” I said quietly, and heard how that sounded—like an apology, like I was asking permission.

I corrected myself. “Not careful with you. Careful with *me.*”

Sharl didn’t interrupt. She just watched, patient, letting me take the time I needed.

“I didn’t want to… put anything on you,” I continued. “I didn’t want to make you feel like my feelings are another thing you have to manage.”

Sharl’s brows drew together slightly. “You’ve never—”

“I know,” I said. “But I’ve been afraid I might. Because when I feel something, it’s… a lot. And I’m hyper-aware of how easily people can do damage without meaning to.”

Sharl’s hands tightened a little around her mug, then loosened again. “You’re not damaging,” she said softly.

I almost laughed at her certainty. “You don’t get to decide that.”

Sharl’s mouth tilted. “And you don’t get to decide it alone either.”

That stopped me.

Good.

It brought us onto level ground.

I drew another breath, and the words finally lined up as if they’d been waiting for permission.

“I love you,” I said.

No flourish.

No dramatic pause.

Just the sentence, clean and plain, spoken like a fact I’d finally stopped trying to negotiate with.

Sharl went still.

Not frightened.

Not overwhelmed.

Just… still, the way you go still when something lands exactly where it was always going to land.

I felt my pulse in my throat. I forced myself not to reach for her, not to close the distance in a way that could turn my confession into a demand.

Instead, I stayed where I was and gave her the only gift that mattered:

Space.

Sharl blinked once. Then again.

Her voice, when it came, was quiet. “Celeste…”

I held her gaze. “You don’t have to say it back. You don’t have to say anything back. I just—” I swallowed. “I needed you to know. Because it’s been true for a while, and I’m tired of pretending it isn’t.”

Sharl’s eyes shone slightly, not with tears exactly, but with something like relief.

“You’re… sure?” she asked, and there was something almost heartbreaking in the question—not doubt of me, but doubt that anyone could love her without conditions.

I felt my own chest tighten.

“Yes,” I said, without hesitation. “And not in a confused way. Not in a ‘project’ way. Not because I like the idea of you. You. As you are.”

Sharl’s lips parted, then closed. She looked down at her hands, as if checking herself for the right response.

Then she did something small and brave.

She set her mug down.

Her hands were slightly unsteady—not from fear, but from the sheer unfamiliarity of being loved openly and not having to earn it.

She looked back at me.

“I love you too,” she said.

The words were simple. Almost matter-of-fact. Not rehearsed. Not embellished.

And that was what made them devastating.

My eyes stung. I hated it. I let it happen anyway.

Sharl’s voice softened further, barely above a whisper. “I didn’t think… I didn’t think I was allowed to want this.”

A flash of anger moved through me—not at her, at the world that had taught her that love was something she had to deserve by being useful.

I kept my voice steady. “You are allowed,” I said. “You’re allowed to want. You’re allowed to be wanted.”

Sharl let out a breath that sounded like she’d been holding it for years.

I waited—still not moving first, still giving her control.

And Sharl, finally, leaned into me.

Not a pounce. Not a grab.

A careful, trusting movement—like resting her head against my shoulder was an experiment she was afraid might be revoked.

I wrapped my arm around her, firm and warm, the way you hold someone when you mean it.

Not chivalrous.

Not masculine.

Devoutly, undeniably woman: containing, protective, present.

Sharl’s body softened against mine, and for a moment neither of us said anything.

Outside, the night air moved through the cracked window, cool at last, carrying the scent of summer’s end.

Inside, everything felt quiet and inevitable and right.

The fullness of time.

Not a rush.

Not a test.

Just two women on a couch, finally saying what had already been true—out loud—without it turning into a demand.

And in the silence that followed, I realised something with a strange, fierce peace:

I hadn’t broken her.

I’d arrived.

And she’d met me there.

**Robyn:**

The first time we hear from Sharl - this is going to be Sharl's POV.

He is sitting at breakfast with Celeste. He is suddenly aware of smells, of colors (apparently, oestrogen will affect the senses). He smells the fall leaves outside, Celeste's perfume, the linen chemise he's wearing (new design). This scene is all about his sensory experience... and it overflows into serene happiness when Celeste looks over at him and says: "Charlotte." Not 'Sharl' short for Charlemagne... Charlotte.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Charlotte” (Sharl POV)

The morning had a softness to it that felt… engineered.

Not by weather. By some quiet agreement between light and air, as if the world had decided to stop shouting for a moment and speak in a lower register.

Sharl sat at the little table with Celeste—breakfast laid out with the practical elegance she defaulted to when she wasn’t under siege. Toast. Fruit. Coffee for her. Tea for him. The sort of meal that didn’t try to be romantic and therefore, somehow, ended up being intimate anyway.

He held his mug in both hands and became aware—suddenly, inconveniently—of how much *there was to notice*.

Not in an anxious way.

In a *rich* way.

It began with smell.

Through the cracked window came the scent of fallen leaves—damp and tannic, like tea brewed too long, but pleasant. The air carried the faint mineral bite of cool morning, and underneath it a hint of eucalyptus, and something else—earth, humus, the idea of decay that wasn’t sad so much as honest.

He could smell the season turning.

He hadn’t realised he’d been half-noseblind to the world until now.

Then, closer: Celeste.

Her perfume sat in the air like a signature he could read with his lungs. Not loud, not sugary—cleaner than that. There was citrus in it, and something floral that didn’t feel like a bouquet so much as a single stem crushed gently between fingers. When she moved her arm to reach for her coffee, it shifted subtly, and his body registered it the way a compass registers north.

His throat tightened, not with desire exactly—something calmer.

Recognition.

And then the linen.

He looked down and realised he could smell his own clothing.

That was the strangest thing.

He wore a chemise—new design, fresh from Wardrobe’s prototypes. Linen, cut clean and period-correct, not fussy, not sheer, not designed to be looked at. Designed to sit against skin and behave. Designed to make work possible. Designed for comfort without apology.

He had washed it last night and hung it to dry. Now it smelled faintly of soap—simple, almost chalky—and underneath that, the clean, plant-sweet scent of linen itself. A quiet smell. Honest. Like flour in a paper bag.

He breathed in and felt his shoulders drop, as if his body had been waiting for this particular kind of ordinary.

He became aware of colour next.

Not in the way people talked about colour—names, descriptions, opinions.

In the way light actually behaved.

The pale yellow of morning on the tabletop didn’t look flat. It had layers. The grain of the wood was not just brown; it was warm and cool at once, tiny rivers of tone. The apple on the plate wasn’t simply red; it held green at the stem, a blush where the light hit, a shadow that wasn’t grey but violet-brown.

It was as if the world had been printed slightly out of register before, and now someone had aligned it.

He blinked once, slow.

His eyes felt… softer, somehow. Not weaker. Less harsh.

He hadn’t expected this.

He hadn’t expected to wake up and find the world had become more detailed without becoming louder.

Celeste spoke—just a normal sentence about her schedule, her week off, the slow run at Wardrobe—and her voice threaded through the morning like a ribbon. He listened and found himself noticing small things he never used to notice: the way her mouth softened at certain words, the faint rasp at the edge of her tone when she’d slept poorly, the warmth in her vowels when she wasn’t performing authority.

He watched her hands while she spoke.

Women’s hands always did so much without fuss. They conveyed decisions. They carried care. They made the world workable.

He used to feel awkward about looking.

Now it felt… natural. Not hungry. Not invasive.

Just attentive.

He looked out the window again and smelled the leaves once more, and the scent went straight into him like a memory of a life he’d never lived: crisp air, wool coats in storage, the promise of cooler nights. He could almost taste it, that sharpness at the back of the throat that came with autumn.

He realised he was smiling.

Not in a social way.

In a private way, as if happiness had simply leaked out of him because there was nowhere else for it to go.

Celeste paused mid-sip and glanced at him.

Her eyes held him the way they had begun to hold him lately—direct, calm, not demanding. She didn’t look at him like a puzzle or a project. She looked at him like he belonged at her table.

“What?” Sharl asked softly, suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed to have been caught enjoying something.

Celeste’s mouth tilted, not quite a smile.

She didn’t tease.

She didn’t make a joke.

She simply watched him for a beat longer, as if weighing something, and then she spoke a single word that turned the whole room bright:

“Charlotte.”

He didn’t answer at first.

He couldn’t.

The name landed in him with an almost physical sensation—like warmth spreading through the sternum, like a tight thread snapping, like an old door that had been stuck for years finally opening without complaint.

Charlotte.

Not Sharl—the clever shortening, the workplace compromise, the name Camille had announced like a christening and everyone had taken up with affection.

Charlotte was… different.

It wasn’t a nickname. It wasn’t a workaround.

It was a full name.

A woman’s name.

A name you could live inside.

He swallowed, and it felt like his throat had been holding something back for months. The air tasted faintly of coffee and leaves and linen and her perfume.

He looked at Celeste, trying to find the catch.

There wasn’t one.

Celeste’s gaze didn’t flicker. She wasn’t performing tenderness. She wasn’t checking the room for witnesses.

It was just the two of them, and her voice had placed the name in front of him like a gift you didn’t have to earn.

He felt his eyes sting.

Not tears falling—just that sharp, humiliating brightness that came when something hit the softest part of you and didn’t apologise for it.

“Charlotte,” he repeated, voice barely there.

The sound of it in his own mouth made something settle.

Like a body finally recognising its own outline.

Celeste nodded once, as if confirming a decision she’d already made privately and was now calmly committing to out loud.

He didn’t know what to do with the happiness that flooded him.

It was too much for his chest. Too clean.

He lowered his gaze to his hands wrapped around the mug and saw the faint pinkness in his fingertips from the warmth, the delicate lines of skin, the way the light lay across them.

He breathed in again—leaves, linen, citrus-floral perfume—and the world felt suddenly, exquisitely real.

When he looked back up, Celeste was still watching him.

Her eyes were steady.

Protective, yes—but not hovering.

As if she were saying: *I see you. I’m not leaving.*

He tried to speak. His voice wavered once.

“Thank you,” he managed.

Celeste’s expression softened, almost imperceptibly.

“You don’t have to thank me,” she said. “It’s yours.”

And the morning—simple breakfast, quiet room, the scent of autumn turning outside—became something else entirely.

Not dramatic.

Not a story you’d tell loudly.

Just a moment of serene happiness so complete it felt like it had always been waiting for him to become quiet enough to hear it.

**Robyn:**

Celeste always slept with the window open. Summer or winter: didn't matter. I could be freezing outside... that windows was always open. And here we are, mid winter. It's been a grueling day at Wardrobe. A whole range of petticoats had been rejected: the instructions had been clear, and clearly not followed. The ensuing discussion with the seamstress revealed that she had also outsourced the work, and so the standard had suffered. "We're not paying for this until it's right!"
When Celeste and Charlotte got home, they were both exhausted, for different reasons. Charlotte made jacket potatoes and bangers with broccoli: quick and easy. Celeste had a shower and came out to a fixed dinner. She tells Charlotte to go have a shower: she complies. There's a vintage-style nightgown waiting for her as she dries off. She dresses in the nightgown (nothing revealing but comfy) and as she comes into the tiny living room, Celeste takes her by the hand, leads her into her bedroom. They spoon-snuggle under the dunna.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Window Open” (Celeste POV, mid-winter)

I slept with the window open.

Summer or winter—it didn’t matter. It could be freezing outside, the kind of cold that made the air feel sharp in your nostrils, and that window would still be cracked like a stubborn principle.

Fresh air mattered.

It kept the room honest.

It kept the night from turning into a sealed container where your thoughts bounced around until they bruised you.

Tonight, though, the cold had teeth.

The day had had teeth too.

Wardrobe had chewed on us from the moment we walked in.

By midday we’d already known something was wrong—not in a dramatic way, in a craft way. Petticoats arriving that looked fine at first glance and then failed in the hand: the wrong seam finish, inconsistent gathers, hems that wandered. The kind of work that screamed *someone stopped caring halfway through*.

Mara had opened the first box, lifted the top piece, and gone very still.

That stillness was always the warning.

Sarah, hovering like a cat with opinions, had muttered, “Oh no,” in a voice that said she was enjoying the impending violence purely on aesthetic grounds.

Mara hadn’t raised her voice. She didn’t need to.

She had laid the petticoat flat, smoothed it once, and then said, flat as a blade, “Reject.”

Lauren had been there, calm as a judge, already pulling the packet from the file. “Spec is clear,” she’d said.

Mara’s pen had tapped a line. **SEAM FINISH: FLAT-FELLED. NO OVERLOCK.** She’d looked up with that cold craft certainty.

“They overlocked,” she said. “Again.”

“Again?” I’d asked, already feeling something tighten in my chest.

Mara’s eyes had narrowed. “Again.”

The call to the seamstress had been immediate. No dithering. No “maybe it’s okay.” The whole point of the system was that it didn’t negotiate with standards.

Lauren put it on speaker, because this time Mara wanted it heard. Not as theatre. As policy.

The seamstress—pleasant voice, quick apologies—tried to explain.

Mara didn’t let her.

“The instructions were clear,” Mara said. “You did not follow them.”

There had been a pause. A tiny, guilty hesitation in the other woman’s breathing.

Then the truth had tumbled out: she’d outsourced part of the run. Another pair of hands. Another standard. A dilution.

As if Wardrobe were a logo you could slap on anything as long as it looked similar from a distance.

Mara’s face had gone hard in a way I rarely saw. Not rage. Something worse: contempt for sloppiness pretending to be necessity.

Lauren’s voice stayed calm, but it sharpened like steel. “You don’t subcontract our contract without telling us.”

“I was just trying to meet the deadline,” the seamstress had said, like deadlines were a moral excuse.

Mara’s pen scratched across the ledger. **CONTRACTOR BREACH.**

Then she spoke, and the sentence landed like a door being bolted.

“We’re not paying for this until it’s right.”

The seamstress had tried again—apologies, pleading, the soft manipulations people used when they wanted you to feel guilty for enforcing consequences.

Lauren didn’t move an inch. “You will redo it to spec,” she said. “In your hands. Or you will not be contracted again. This is not negotiable.”

Sarah, under her breath, had murmured, “God, I love you when you’re terrifying.”

Mara had ignored her. She closed the box and slid it away as if it were contaminated.

That was the day. Not a catastrophe. A boundary.

Necessary.

And exhausting.

---

By the time Charlotte and I got home, dusk had already turned the street into a quiet, cold corridor. The kind of winter evening where your keys feel sharper in your hand and the air seems to cut into your cheeks.

Charlotte’s cheeks were pink from the cold when she stepped inside, and I saw the strain in her too—different from mine, but real. Her body was doing its quiet work now, changes accumulating in the background while she tried to stay centred and useful and unremarkable.

I could tell she was tired from holding herself steady in a day that required steadiness.

I was tired from enforcing a world.

We came in, kicked shoes off, and without speaking Charlotte went straight to the kitchen like it was a refuge.

“I’ll do dinner,” she said softly.

I didn’t argue. I didn’t pretend I had energy to be the one who insisted on fairness. We took turns, and she was offering.

I went to the shower and turned the water hot enough to feel like it was scrubbing the day off my skin. Steam filled the tiny bathroom, fogged the mirror, softened the hard edges in my chest for a few minutes.

When I came out, hair damp, wearing my old hoodie, I smelled food immediately: warm potato, browned sausage, the sharp-green cleanliness of broccoli.

Simple. Filling. Quiet.

Charlotte had jacket potatoes split open on plates, bangers laid beside them, broccoli piled in that deliberate way she had—tidy, not fussy. The kitchen light caught the linen of her chemise peeking beneath her T-shirt, and for a second my chest did that familiar tightening-softening thing it did now when I saw her in domestic motion.

She glanced up. “Eat while it’s hot.”

I sat. I ate. I didn’t make conversation. The kindest thing we could do tonight was not force cheerfulness onto exhaustion.

Halfway through, I realised I could hear the faint whisper of air coming from my bedroom.

The window.

Still open.

Of course it was.

Even in this cold.

I felt an odd wave of gratitude for my own stubbornness. The air made the apartment feel alive.

Charlotte finished, rinsed her plate, wiped the bench with that exacting care she’d made into a ritual, and looked at me as if waiting for instruction.

Not submissive—attentive. The way she’d always been, and the way I was slowly teaching her she didn’t have to be.

“Go have a shower,” I said gently. “Properly warm up.”

Charlotte blinked once. “Now?”

“Now,” I repeated. “You’ve carried today. I can carry fifteen minutes.”

Her shoulders loosened. “Okay.”

She disappeared into the bathroom. I heard the water start. Steam began to creep under the door.

I moved to the bedroom and pulled out the nightgown I’d laid aside earlier—vintage-style, soft cotton, long enough to be modest, loose enough to be kind. Comfortable, not performative. Something that said: *you can come home to yourself here.*

I laid it on the bed, smoothed it once, and then—because I was me—I cracked the window a fraction more.

Cold rushed in immediately, clean and sharp. It made the doona feel like a promise.

When Charlotte emerged, towel around her hair, cheeks flushed from the shower, she paused in the doorway and saw the nightgown.

For a moment she just stood there, as if she didn’t trust good things arriving without conditions.

Then she picked it up with careful hands.

“It’s… for me?” she asked.

“Yes,” I said simply. “If you want it.”

Charlotte’s throat moved as she swallowed. “I want it.”

She dressed quietly in the bathroom, and when she came into the living room the nightgown fell around her in a way that wasn’t revealing at all—just soft, domestic, honest. The kind of garment that didn’t ask to be looked at but made you feel held.

She hesitated, as if waiting to be told what the right next step was.

I stood, crossed the small space between us, and took her hand.

Charlotte’s fingers were warm, still faintly damp from the shower, and she squeezed back with that cautious trust she offered when she was trying not to want too much.

“Come on,” I said.

I led her into my bedroom.

The cold from the open window met us immediately—icy on the face, clean in the lungs. The doona was piled thick on the bed, a heavy, comforting weight. The kind of weight that made you feel like you could stop holding yourself up.

Charlotte glanced at the window with a faint, bewildered little frown.

“You’re… not cold?” she asked.

“I like it,” I said. “It makes the bed feel earned.”

She made a small sound that might have been a laugh, then climbed in when I guided her, careful not to tangle herself in the doona.

I slid in behind her and pulled the covers up around us.

The cold air stayed outside the cocoon of the bed, and inside was warmth—shared warmth, the simplest kind. I wrapped an arm around her waist, careful, firm, protective in the way I did everything: not chivalry, not possession. Containment.

Charlotte let out a breath that sounded like her body had been waiting all day for permission to melt.

She settled back into me, her shoulders lowering, her spine softening against my chest.

No words were needed.

The day had already taken enough.

We spoon-snuggled under the dunna, the open window letting winter breathe into the room while our shared warmth held steady beneath the covers.

Charlotte’s hand found mine where it rested at her waist and threaded her fingers through mine—quiet, deliberate.

In the dark, I felt her relax completely, and the tension in my own chest finally unspooled.

Outside, the cold pressed against the glass.

Inside, everything was safe.

**Robyn:**

I'm going to give Charlotte and Celeste privacy, now: they earned it. What, if anything they do in their intimate moments, is their business, not ours. 

Lauren hasn't seen Charlotte for some time - wasn't there for the name-change or ponoun change, and now, we're going to experience her coming to terms with all that has happened (including the young women's blossoming romance) as only Lauren can. Oh, and let's make is conversationally truly interesting (and challenging) - Sarah brings Lauren up to speed on events and finally they touch on Charlotte. Lauren voices misgivings whether this was really what her now daughter wanted: Sarah gives her a detailed description of what she, as an outsider observed, in Charlotte's metamorphosis. Lauren is finally comfortable with the fact that she has a new daughter and of course Sarah has to up-end the applecart by confessing/revealing she (Sarah) might be bi-curious. Because, of course she does.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Catching Up” (Lauren POV)

Lauren arrived at Wardrobe with her keys already in her hand and a look on her face that said she’d been solving other people’s problems since dawn.

The season had shifted while she’d been away—midwinter pressing at the windows, the light thinner, the air sharper. Wardrobe smelled of wool and steam and that clean-paper tang of manifests. The finishing room door was closed, and the stamp sat on its pad like a small blunt truth:

**WARDROBE — INSPECTED / APPROVED**

Lauren paused just inside the main room and took it in—new flow, less clutter, fewer frantic movements. The place looked… *run*. Not improvised. Not held together by adrenaline.

That pleased her.

It also worried her slightly, because a machine that ran smoothly often meant the real change had happened elsewhere.

Sarah appeared from behind a hanging rail, tea in hand, wearing an expression that was far too bright for eight-thirty in the morning.

“Well,” Sarah said. “Look who’s back. Our very own Minister for Consequences.”

Lauren gave her a dry look. “Good morning to you too.”

Sarah grinned. “I’m being affectionate. I’m growing as a person.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked over her. “Are you ill?”

Sarah laughed and waved her toward the back. “Come on. Tea. You’ve missed things.”

Lauren followed, because she knew Sarah’s tone. This wasn’t gossip. It was briefing.

They settled in the little corner by the ledger shelf—two mismatched chairs, a table that had seen too many invoices. Sarah poured tea as if she were officiating something.

Lauren wrapped her hands around the mug and said, “Alright. Start.”

Sarah took a sip, savouring her own drama. “Wardrobe is fine. Better than fine. We hit capacity, we capped it, we stopped chasing endless growth like daft idiots. Mara’s… marginally less feral now that she’s not doing three people’s work.”

Lauren nodded once. “Good.”

“And,” Sarah added, eyes glittering, “she’s taking up oil painting.”

Lauren’s brows rose. “She’s what.”

Sarah nodded solemnly. “I know. I, too, am in shock. She nearly smiled at an apple.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “I’ll believe it when I see it.”

“You will,” Sarah promised. “She’ll hate it at first and then become terrifyingly good and refuse to admit she enjoys it.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed. “You pushed her into that.”

“I guided her,” Sarah said sweetly. “Like a gentle shepherd. With a cattle prod.”

Lauren’s gaze softened a fraction. She knew what Sarah was really saying: the place was stable enough for Mara to have a life beyond standards.

“That’s… good,” Lauren conceded.

Sarah leaned forward slightly, tone shifting. “Now,” she said, “the rest.”

Lauren didn’t move. “Charlotte.”

Sarah held Lauren’s gaze for a beat—long enough to signal that this required care—and then nodded.

“Yes,” Sarah said. “Charlotte.”

Lauren’s throat tightened around the word she hadn’t yet practised. She hadn’t been there for the name change. Or the pronouns. She’d been away doing mother things of a different sort—work, logistics, life—assuming time would hold still until she came back.

Time never did.

Sarah watched her with an unusual restraint. “Do you want the short version or the proper one?”

Lauren stared into her tea as if the surface might provide a script.

“Proper,” she said quietly. “I don’t want… summaries.”

Sarah nodded, as if she respected that more than anything else.

“Alright,” Sarah said. “So. You remember Sharl, yes?”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “I remember my child.”

Sarah’s expression softened. “Good. Keep that. Because that’s the thread through all of it.”

Lauren didn’t speak.

Sarah began carefully, but not delicately. Sarah’s gift was that she could tell the truth without making it sentimental.

“It wasn’t sudden,” Sarah said. “It looked sudden from the outside because the *words* changed in a short window. But the shift? That’s been happening for ages. The steadiness. The posture. The way she moves through space.”

Lauren’s hand tightened around her mug. “She,” she repeated, almost testing it.

Sarah nodded once, firm. “She.”

Lauren breathed out. Not a sob. Not relief. Just… an acceptance beginning to settle.

Sarah continued. “At first, it was practical. She found comfort in women’s routines—skincare, hair, the way women support each other without needing applause. She enforced boundaries like a woman enforces them. Calm. Unromantic. Consequential. The kind that men hate because there’s nothing to argue with.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked up. “That sounds like her.”

Sarah’s mouth twitched. “It does, doesn’t it.”

Lauren swallowed. “But… how do you know this is what she wanted? How do you know she’s not—” Her voice tightened. “—adapting for Celeste. Or for the shop. Or for us.”

Sarah didn’t scoff. She didn’t mock. That was how Lauren knew this was real.

“Because,” Sarah said simply, “I’ve watched her when no one was watching.”

Lauren’s eyes sharpened. “Explain.”

Sarah set her mug down.

“Lauren,” she said, voice quieter, “I’m a gobshite, but I’m not blind. I’ve seen men perform. I’ve seen women perform. I’ve seen people contort themselves to be loved. This isn’t that.”

Lauren’s throat worked. “What is it then.”

Sarah’s expression grew oddly serious. “It’s… settling. Like a person who has been clenched for years finally unclenches and realises the unclenched version is the real one.”

Lauren looked down, blinking hard.

Sarah went on, more detailed now, because Lauren needed evidence, not reassurance.

“The old tells are gone,” Sarah said. “You know the ones: the bracing, the reflex to apologise for taking up space, the constant scanning to see if she’s about to be punished. Those have faded. Not because she’s being rewarded. Because she stopped believing she deserved punishment in the first place.”

Lauren’s lips parted. “That’s… that’s not—”

“It is,” Sarah said, gently relentless. “And the changes in her body? They’re happening, yes. But the bigger change is the way she lives inside it. She’s not fighting it. She’s not bargaining with it. She’s just… inhabiting herself.”

Lauren’s eyes glistened. She blinked again, rough.

“And Celeste?” Lauren asked. The question held fear under it. Fear of blame. Fear of coercion. Fear of having missed something important.

Sarah snorted—softly, fondly. “Celeste didn’t make her. If anything, Celeste took *forever* because she was terrified of doing damage. She didn’t push. She waited. She watched. She asked permission with her whole body.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “And now they’re… together.”

Sarah’s grin returned, but it wasn’t sharp this time. It was warm.

“Quietly,” Sarah said. “Like grown-ups. Like women who respect each other. Wardrobe stays safe. No spectacle. No office romance nonsense. Just… real.”

Lauren sat very still.

Her eyes moved—not darting, not searching the room for proof, but looking inward, running the long ledger of her life with her child. Every clue. Every memory. Every moment that, in hindsight, had been pointing toward this without her being ready to see it.

Finally she said, voice low, “I’m scared I missed the chance to be there.”

Sarah’s tone softened. “You didn’t miss it,” she said. “You just didn’t witness every step. She’s still here. And she’s still yours.”

Lauren exhaled, shaking slightly. “My daughter,” she whispered, and the words weren’t forced. They were tender and raw, like a seam allowance pressed open to lay flat.

Sarah watched her for a beat, then—because Sarah couldn’t let sincerity sit too long without giving it legs—she said, “Also, you’re going to have to update your mental slideshow. Because calling her ‘he’ now feels faintly ridiculous.”

Lauren let out a small, surprised laugh, half-hiccup. “Does it.”

“It does,” Sarah confirmed. “Like calling the ocean a puddle.”

Lauren wiped at the corner of one eye with the back of her hand, annoyed at herself for leaking.

“I just—” she began, voice catching, “I wanted her to have a life that didn’t hurt.”

Sarah nodded, eyes steady. “She does,” she said. “It doesn’t mean it’s easy. But it’s… hers. And she looks happier. Not in a performative way. In a way that makes the room quieter.”

Lauren stared at the tabletop, breathing carefully.

Then she looked up at Sarah and said, “Thank you.”

Sarah recoiled theatrically. “God, don’t get emotional on me.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Too late.”

Sarah sighed, as if burdened by the weight of other people’s sincerity. “Fine,” she said. “But I’m only allowing this because you’re actually being… very good about it.”

Lauren’s eyes softened. “I’m trying.”

Sarah nodded once. “You are. And she’ll feel it.”

Lauren sat back, shoulders loosening by degrees.

A silence settled—the kind that meant something had been placed correctly, not perfectly but correctly.

Then, of course, Sarah ruined it.

She cleared her throat in an exaggerated way.

Lauren’s eyes narrowed. “What.”

Sarah took a sip of tea as if fortifying herself. “Right,” she said. “Since we’re doing heart-to-hearts and emotional maturity and all that nauseating rubbish…”

Lauren’s face went wary. “Sarah.”

Sarah barreled on. “I might be… bi-curious.”

Lauren stared at her.

Sarah stared back, defiant. “What.”

Lauren blinked slowly, as if rebooting. “Why are you telling me this.”

Sarah shrugged. “Because it’s relevant.”

“To *what*.”

Sarah waved a hand toward the whole room, the whole world, as if the context were obvious. “To the general theme of women being better, obviously.”

Lauren’s mouth opened.

Closed.

Then she burst into a laugh that sounded startled, genuine, and deeply needed.

Sarah looked smug. “There we go. Laughter. Healing.”

Lauren shook her head, still laughing softly. “You are impossible.”

“I am a gift,” Sarah said.

Lauren wiped her eyes again—this time from humour, thank God—and breathed out.

The cold outside still existed. The world still had teeth.

But inside Wardrobe, in this little corner with tea and sarcasm and the steady hum of a business run by women who refused to accept lesser standards, Lauren felt the truth finally settle without pain:

She had a daughter.

And her daughter was loved.

And, because Sarah couldn’t resist kicking the applecart even when everyone was still gathering the apples—

Sarah might be in love with women too.

Lauren looked at her over the rim of her mug and said, dry as ever, “I’m going to pretend you didn’t say that.”

Sarah grinned. “No you’re not.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched again.

“No,” she admitted softly. “I’m not.”

And for the first time since she’d walked in, Lauren’s shoulders truly lowered—as if her body had finally accepted what her mind was catching up to:

The girl her child had become wasn’t a loss.

She was a homecoming.

**Robyn:**

Nothing at Wardrobe had changed... absolutely nothing, except one thing. No one entering Wardrobe from the ouside world saw nothing unusual anymore. Unlike before, it was now completely a woman's doman, a woman's atelier, a woman's safe space. The first sign the metamorphosis was complete was that couriers were no longer ... curious. They were courteous ... and left. Charlotte's focus as tester shifted somewhat as she 'blossomed': new support issues were zeroed in on more successfully because she fitted the 'well-nourished' class of woman far better than 'nymph'. Like mother, like daughter: Charlotte inherited Lauren's disposition and... other attributes as well. Which made her an excellent tester in a whole new realm. Wardrobe was turning down order requests. And knockoff brands tried to capitalise on it. They could buy an outfit, tear it apart, make a new template and STILL not replicate Mara and Charlotte and Sarah and Celeste. These women were the part of the garment that was truly 'value-added'. That can't be replicated.

**Emily:**

Nothing at Wardrobe had changed.

Not in the ways the outside world noticed, anyway.

The same bell over the door. The same smell—wool, steam, paper, the ghost of chalk. The same rail of garments, the same ledger, the same hard table that had been scarred by scissors and pins and decisions. Mara still spoke in the language of standards. Sarah still provided weather. Celeste still held the shape of the operation without ever needing to announce she was doing it.

And yet something had completed itself so thoroughly that it became invisible.

That was the tell.

People from the outside world stopped *clocking* the place.

They walked in and saw what it had always been trying to be: a women’s atelier. A women’s domain. A safe space that wasn’t declared with posters or slogans, but with the more compelling evidence of reality—how bodies moved, how boundaries were held, how work was done, and how nothing in the room bent to accommodate male entitlement.

Before, you could feel the micro-currents whenever an outsider entered. The half-second of appraisal, the subtle “what’s going on here,” the faint curiosity that always had a predatory edge—men trying to decide where they sat in the hierarchy, how much they could joke, whether the women were serious or merely performing seriousness.

Now? Nothing.

The first sign the metamorphosis was complete was the couriers.

It wasn’t a grand moment. It wasn’t even announced.

It was simply that couriers stopped lingering.

They stopped scanning. Stopped asking little questions in fake-friendly voices. Stopped “noticing” Charlotte like she was an anecdote they could take home.

They became what they were meant to be: professional.

They arrived, were courteous, collected or delivered, and left.

No curiosity.

No hang-time.

No weirdness.

Just a nod at Lauren or Sarah, a quick “cheers,” and the soft thud of cartons moving in and out like heartbeats.

It was an astonishing relief—so quiet you could almost miss it. The kind of relief you only recognised because you’d been holding your breath before.

Inside, the work continued—unchanged in form, altered in essence.

Charlotte’s focus as tester shifted the way everything in Wardrobe shifted: pragmatically, without theatre.

When she’d been a “nymph” silhouette, the testing had been about one set of problems—how garments hung on a narrow frame, where they pulled, where they rode, which seams failed because the body beneath them didn’t offer the expected fullness.

But now she had… presence.

Not exaggerated, not cartooned. Just the gentle insistence of a well-nourished woman’s body: hips that asked the skirt to behave properly, a bust that required support to be intelligent rather than loud, a softness that changed pressure points and revealed weak decisions in patterning the way a storm reveals weak roofing.

It wasn’t that she was “bigger.”

It was that she fit a different class of reality.

And it made Wardrobe better.

Mara loved it, because Mara loved truth.

A garment that looked impeccable on a narrow frame but failed under the honest physics of a fuller body wasn’t “beautiful.” It was unfinished.

Charlotte made those failures visible—quietly, reliably—without ever making herself the story. She would simply walk, sit, lift a box, lean over a table, and then say, calmly, like an engineer:

“It rides up here.”

“The boning presses here after an hour.”

“This seam rubs when I reach.”

“Support needs redistributing.”

Mara would grunt once—approval or condemnation, hard to tell—and make a note. Sarah would mutter something obscene but affectionate. Celeste would adjust workflow and schedule like the quiet governor of a small, competent country.

And Lauren, when she saw Charlotte now, couldn’t unsee the resemblance that went beyond temperament.

Like mother, like daughter.

Not just the steadiness. Not just the backbone.

Other attributes too—the kind you couldn’t fake in a fitting room. The kind that changed the entire engineering of a bodice. The kind that made Charlotte, suddenly, an excellent tester in a realm Wardrobe hadn’t been able to stress-test as well before without asking women on staff to donate their bodies to the process.

Charlotte didn’t resent it.

She didn’t preen about it.

She simply… belonged to the work in a way that made the work truer.

And Wardrobe, now that it could meet demand, did the most quietly radical thing a women-run business could do:

It said no.

Not because it couldn’t.

Because it wouldn’t.

Mara would look at a request and say, flatly, “No. Not our category.”

Lauren would decline politely, and you could hear the steadiness behind her words: a refusal to trade life for money.

Celeste, in her own language, would cap it: “We’re at capacity. We’re not expanding.”

Sarah would snort and say, “Try Shein,” and then everyone would pretend she hadn’t.

And of course, when you say no, the outside world does what it always does: it tries to steal.

Knockoff brands began circling.

Not with respect, but with opportunism—because men with spreadsheets always believed craft could be reverse-engineered if you tore it apart.

They’d buy a Wardrobe outfit, take it home, unpick it seam by seam, lay it out like a dissected animal, and trace templates as if they’d discovered the secret.

They could copy the measurements. The shapes. The materials.

They could even get close, sometimes, to the *look*—in a photograph, at a distance, under forgiving light.

But they could not replicate Wardrobe.

Because the value wasn’t only in the pattern.

It was in the women.

It was in Mara’s eye—the ruthless, unromantic refusal to let a seam lie, the way she could look at a bodice and see the future failure point before it happened.

It was in Charlotte’s body and honesty—the way she could feel a support problem and name it precisely, without shame, without apology, without making herself the spectacle.

It was in Sarah’s bluntness—the way she would mock an idea into honesty, cut through nonsense, and defend the room with teeth when someone tried to bring outside-world contempt into it.

It was in Celeste’s control—the quiet governance that kept standards from becoming martyrdom and kept love from becoming leverage.

Those things weren’t “extras.”

They were the garment.

They were the difference between a costume that looked fine on a hanger and a piece of clothing that held a woman’s body with dignity, comfort, and power.

That cannot be unpicked and copied.

Not really.

Not ever.

Because you can steal a template.

You can’t steal a safe space.

You can’t steal the competence network of women who built something true and refused to let it be diluted.

And that—more than any stitch—was what Wardrobe was selling now.

Not clothing.

Standards.

And the women who made those standards real.

**Robyn:**

Alright, time for a debrief, you and me, Emily. I sort-of took the direction of the story and you very purposefully kept things on a decent, safe plane, which is what I wanted. We even ventured into terrain I'm sure you would have warned away from. But in the end, the story has evolved beautifully, believeably, relate-ably. 
Now, my questions: what do YOU think of it all, so far?
And, where does it go from here?

**Emily:**

I think what you’ve built so far is unusually *coherent*—not just in plot, but in ethics and tone. It reads like a story that knows what it’s doing, and therefore doesn’t need to wink, over-explain, or “sell” the premise. The transformation is neither a gimmick nor a sermon; it’s an earned reshaping of a life inside a women-led culture that has rules, consequences, tenderness, and no patience for entitlement.

A few things that, to my eye, are doing the heavy lifting (and why they work):

### What’s working exceptionally well

**1) Wardrobe isn’t a backdrop; it’s the engine.**  
You’ve made the atelier a *system*—a competence network—so the romance and the transition don’t float in a vacuum. Everything is anchored to craft, standards, workflow, and boundaries. That makes the emotional beats feel inevitable rather than “written.”

**2) The “no spectacle” principle is a superpower.**  
Because you refuse tests/coercion/gotchas, every step feels human. The reader isn’t asked to accept anything on ideology alone; they accept it because the characters behave like real people with real nervous systems.

**3) Celeste’s love story is feminine courtship, not role-swapping.**  
This is rare, and it’s why it lands. Celeste doesn’t “become the man” in order to initiate. She becomes *more herself*: more tender, more choosing, more willing to be seen. That’s the romance. It’s feminine authority expressed as safety, warmth, and standards.

**4) Charlotte’s arc is self-possession, not performance.**  
The key shift isn’t clothes or pronouns—it’s the end of bargaining (“girl-mode must be deserved”). That’s the psychological hinge, and you nailed it. By the time “Charlotte” is spoken, it feels like a truth being *recognized*, not bestowed.

**5) Secondary women are doing real narrative work.**  
Lauren isn’t just “supportive mum”; she’s the moral spine and the logistics mind. Mara isn’t “tough boss”; she’s the embodiment of standard-as-love. Sarah isn’t comic relief; she’s the social barometer, the one who tests, then learns, then protects. This triangulation is potent.

If I had to sum it up: **you’ve built a story where transformation is not fetish, not shock, not ideology—it’s integration.** And because it’s integration, the romance feels like the natural endpoint of a long alignment rather than a twist.

---

## Where it goes from here

You’re at a satisfying plateau: the system is stable, the romance is named, the pronouns are normalized, the business has hit “enough,” and the women’s domain is complete. The next phase needs a *new kind* of tension—one that doesn’t undo what you’ve established, but tests it.

Here are the directions that feel most organic:

### 1) The outside world tries to buy, brand, or break Wardrobe
You’ve already foreshadowed knockoffs. Now give them a face.

- A brand/producer offers “partnership” that is really extraction: they want Mara’s process, Celeste’s management, Charlotte’s testing, Sarah’s edge—packaged and owned.
- They offer money, exposure, a bigger workshop, even a “women’s empowerment” marketing angle.
- The catch: **they want to sand off what makes Wardrobe Wardrobe**—the boundaries, the refusal of scale, the safety.

This becomes a direct thematic conflict: *standards vs commodification*.

Best part: the women can win without violence—by being consequential, strategic, and united.

### 2) The “museum pieces” arc becomes the story’s prestige test
Camille is a brilliant lever for this.

A museum commission isn’t about volume. It’s about **legacy**. That raises new stakes that don’t rely on gender drama.

- A historically significant set—rare fabric constraints, documented construction methods, curatorial demands.
- Mara is in her element, but it strains her perfectionism.
- Celeste must manage scope and deadlines without triggering martyr mode.
- Charlotte’s tester role becomes subtly prestigious: *the garments must move correctly, not just look correct.*

This arc can culminate in an exhibition opening where the women see their work “in the world” without the world being allowed to own them.

### 3) Sarah’s growth arc: from barbed observer to emotionally literate protector
You already started it with “off the table” and her bi-curious confession.

Give Sarah a storyline that’s not romance-first, but identity-honesty-first:

- She keeps dating men and realises she’s been using humour as a defence against longing.
- She tries one date with a woman—awkward, not magical.
- Or she simply admits she’s lonely and tired of performing “unbothered.”

This will deepen the ensemble and keep the theme consistent: women learning to want without apology.

### 4) Lauren’s private reckoning becomes its own chapter
You promised you’d return to her feelings later. That’s fertile ground.

Not as guilt porn—more like: **maternal love re-learning its shape**.

- Lauren has a moment of grief for “the son” in a way she doesn’t feel proud of.
- Then she realises grief is not disloyalty; it’s transition.
- She chooses her daughter anyway, again and again, until it becomes effortless.
- She witnesses something ordinary—Charlotte laughing, cooking, being competent—and the grief evaporates into love.

That’s an incredibly human arc, and it keeps the tone clean.

### 5) Charlotte’s next internal step: not “transition content,” but adulthood
Now that she’s comfortable, what does she *want* beyond being useful?

- Study? Apprenticeship? Design credit? A role name that is hers?
- Her first act of self-advocacy at Wardrobe that isn’t framed as service: “I want to learn X” or “I want to stop doing Y.”
- A moment where she sets a boundary even with Celeste—small, healthy, not dramatic. That’s true blossoming.

### 6) A single controlled “threat” scene to prove Wardrobe’s culture holds
Not trauma. Just a test of the perimeter.

- A courier, a client, a visiting producer, a wannabe influencer—someone tries to make it weird.
- The women shut it down in ten seconds, boringly, professionally, with consequences.
- Charlotte sees, not fearfully but proudly, that she’s protected by culture, not by one person.

That reinforces your theme: **inclusion is conditional on behaviour; standards over sentiment.**

---

## A clean “next act” spine (if you want one)

If I were structuring this as an Act II/III continuation:

1. **Stability & sweetness** (short, warm scenes: routine, competence, romance quietly deepening).  
2. **An offer** arrives (museum commission + brand partnership interest).  
3. **Boundary pressure**: someone tries to extract/commodify Wardrobe.  
4. **Internal strain**: Mara’s perfectionism, Celeste’s workload, Charlotte’s new desires, Sarah’s vulnerability.  
5. **The women choose**: cap growth, keep standards, accept only the museum work on their terms.  
6. **Public validation without surrender**: exhibition/opening/feature article… that they control.  
7. **Closing movement**: the home life is ordinary, secure—window open, doona, tea, laughter—because the big win is not fame; it’s *a life that fits*.

---

If you tell me which of these “next tensions” appeals most—**(A) commodification offer**, **(B) museum prestige arc**, **(C) Sarah’s identity arc**, **(D) Lauren’s reckoning**, or **(E) Charlotte’s adulthood desires**—I can outline a sequence of 6–10 scenes that keeps the tone you’ve established: consequential, women-led, tender without spectacle, and always grounded in craft.

**Robyn:**

This could go so many directions. Initially, let's focus on Lauren and her discussions with Sarah who she now sees as a sort-of friend, even confidante, thanks to Sarah's honesty. While Lauren's emotional reckoning centres around Charlotte - how much she is embracing it, in a subtle, womanly, mature way - and just the fact of having a new daughter, she is also - this in the back of her mind - wondering why Sarah revealed she was bi-curious to her? Did she pick up signals she (Lauren) wasn't aware she was sending? Was she herself bi-curious? Why was she finding herself thinking about this more and more? This is the emotional subcurrent to resolving the new-daughter conundrum. Several layers of complexity.

**Emily:**

Absolutely. And it’s *deliciously* complex in the right way—because it’s not “plotty” complexity, it’s **human** complexity: the sort that comes from a woman doing two kinds of reckoning at once, and realising they’re not separate.

Lauren is processing Charlotte with maternal love and grief-and-joy braided together… *while* her own inner orientation gets quietly tugged, not by spectacle, but by Sarah’s honesty (and by the fact that Wardrobe has become a world where women tell the truth and don’t get punished for it).

Here’s how I’d frame it going forward, and then I’ll give you a full scene draft that holds all those layers.

---

## What’s really happening under the surface

### 1) Sarah didn’t “hit on” Lauren — she **trusted** her
Sarah’s bi-curious reveal can read as flirtation if you view it through a hetero-default lens. But in your world, it’s more interesting if it’s **a social test of safety**:

- Sarah has watched Lauren become the rare adult who can hear something tender without weaponising it.
- She’s also watched Lauren *choose* her daughter with her whole spine.
- So Sarah “places” a small truth in Lauren’s hands to see if Lauren can hold it without turning it into drama.

That’s intimacy, but not necessarily erotic intimacy. It’s women’s intimacy: **confiding**.

### 2) Lauren’s “am I sending signals?” anxiety is *so* believable
Lauren’s brain will try to regain control by turning ambiguity into a puzzle:

- *Did Sarah pick up something in me?*
- *Did I invite this?*
- *Why am I thinking about it?*
- *Am I allowed to think about it?*

This is especially potent because Lauren’s identity has likely been “mother/provider/manager” for a long time. Desire—her own desire—has been backgrounded. So any new emotional data pings as **threat + curiosity**.

### 3) Charlotte’s transition forces Lauren to re-map “womanhood”
Lauren is learning that “woman” is not merely biology; it’s culture, conduct, safety, mutual regard, standards. That broadening can ricochet inward:

- *If womanhood is not a narrow box… what else in my life have I assumed is fixed?*
- *What parts of myself have I simply never explored because I was too busy surviving?*

That’s the emotional subcurrent you described, and it’s rich.

## Scene draft: Lauren + Sarah, layered and conversational

### Scene — “Signals” (Lauren POV)

Wardrobe in the late afternoon had a particular hush—work still happening, but without the frantic edge of a rush day. The steam had thinned. The light had gone pale and winter-clean, slanting across the cutting table like a soft verdict.

Lauren arrived with an errand that was, on paper, mundane: check manifests, confirm a pickup schedule, sign off on a supplier invoice.

In practice, she arrived because she needed to be in the building that made her feel competent.

Her hands knew what to do here.

Her feelings did not.

Sarah was in the finishing room doorway, tea in hand, watching a courier leave with a nod so brief it could almost be called polite.

“See?” Sarah said, as if reading Lauren’s mind. “No lingering. No curiosity. No weird little questions.”

Lauren’s gaze followed the courier’s back down the hall. “They’ve stopped staring,” she observed.

“Exactly.” Sarah’s smile flashed. “The place finally looks like what it always was.”

Lauren hummed, not committing to anything. She stepped into the finishing room and let her eyes run over the stations—inspection, fix, packing, hold. Tape lines. Gloves by the door. Clipboards like small promises.

Everything in its place.

Her chest loosened a fraction.

Sarah watched her take it in, and then—without ceremony—said, “You look tired.”

Lauren set her keys down on the table and kept her tone dry. “I’m always tired.”

“Mm,” Sarah said. “But you look like the *other* tired.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. She didn’t want to admit it; that would make it real.

Instead she asked, “Where’s Mara?”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “Main room. Being a tyrant. It’s her favourite hobby.”

Lauren almost smiled. “And Charlotte?”

Sarah’s expression changed—very slightly. Not wary. Respectful.

“In fitting,” Sarah said. “Testing a bodice. The new stays are behaving. Mostly.”

The word landed—Charlotte—like a stone placed gently into Lauren’s palm. A name she had accepted intellectually, but was still learning to hold without flinching.

Lauren nodded once. “Right.”

Sarah didn’t push. She took a sip of tea and let the silence do what women’s silences did: make space without withdrawing.

Lauren moved to the ledger shelf, pulled out the manifests, checked numbers she didn’t really need to check. Her eyes tracked lines. Her mind tracked everything else.

Sarah leaned against the table, watching Lauren the way Sarah watched seams: waiting for the point of strain to reveal itself.

After a minute, Lauren said quietly, “I wasn’t here for it.”

Sarah didn’t pretend not to understand. “No.”

“I missed… the changeover,” Lauren continued, voice measured. “The name. The pronouns. All of it.”

Sarah’s tone softened in a way that was almost disorienting. “You didn’t miss her,” she said. “You missed the *moment*. That’s different.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “It doesn’t feel different.”

Sarah let that sit, then said, “Do you want to see her?”

Lauren looked up too quickly. “Not like—” She stopped. Recalibrated. “Yes. I do. I just… don’t want to make it heavy.”

Sarah’s eyes flickered with something like approval. “Good. Then don’t.”

Lauren exhaled, a fraction. “How do I do it right?”

Sarah smiled, not unkindly. “You’re Lauren. You don’t do things ‘right’ by being perfect. You do things right by being consequential.”

Lauren blinked. “That’s not helpful.”

“It is,” Sarah said. “Because you’re trying to turn this into a test you can pass. And it’s not. It’s a relationship. You show up. You keep showing up.”

Lauren stared back down at the manifest, as if numbers could shield her from emotion.

Then—because she couldn’t keep it in any longer—she said, “She seems… happy.”

Sarah’s grin returned, quieter than usual. “She does.”

Lauren swallowed. “And I’m happy about that.”

Sarah held her gaze. “And?”

Lauren’s voice tightened. “And I’m also… grieving.”

Sarah didn’t pounce on the word. She nodded once, simple and adult. “Yep.”

Lauren looked startled, as if she’d expected a reprimand.

Sarah lifted her tea. “You can have both,” she said. “It doesn’t make you disloyal. It makes you human.”

Lauren blinked hard. “I didn’t think I was allowed to say it.”

Sarah’s eyes sharpened. “Lauren, you’re allowed to say anything you can say without making it Charlotte’s burden.”

Lauren’s throat tightened. The line landed cleanly: **feel it, but don’t hand it to her**.

She nodded once. “Yes.”

A silence. Not awkward. Just… full.

Then, as if her mind couldn’t resist solving puzzles, Lauren’s eyes narrowed.

“And you,” she said.

Sarah’s eyebrows rose. “Me?”

Lauren kept her voice steady. “Why did you tell me.”

Sarah took a slow sip. “Tell you what, love?”

Lauren refused to let Sarah wriggle. “That you might be bi-curious.”

Sarah’s grin flashed. “Ohhh. That.”

Lauren watched her carefully now, mother’s gaze, businesswoman’s gaze—trying to detect whether she’d been propositioned without knowing it. Trying to confirm where the boundary was.

Sarah saw it and, for once, didn’t mock her.

“I told you because you’re safe,” Sarah said simply.

Lauren’s brows drew together. “Safe.”

Sarah nodded. “You don’t make women pay for honesty.”

Lauren stared at her. “That’s all?”

Sarah’s mouth tilted. “Is that not enough?”

Lauren’s throat worked. “It should be.”

But it wasn’t the whole truth. Lauren could feel that. Her mind kept circling the other question, the one that felt more dangerous because it wasn’t about Sarah—it was about herself.

She tried to phrase it like a normal person.

“So you weren’t… suggesting,” Lauren said, carefully, “that you’d picked up something in me.”

Sarah’s eyes widened, then she barked a laugh. “Oh my God.”

Lauren bristled. “Don’t.”

Sarah covered her mouth for a moment, then lowered her hand. Her tone turned unexpectedly gentle. “Lauren. No. I wasn’t ‘picking up signals.’”

Lauren’s shoulders loosened, despite herself.

Sarah watched her, then added, not unkindly, “But I can see why you’re asking.”

Lauren felt heat creep up her neck. “Can you.”

Sarah nodded, sober now. “Because you’re the sort of woman who thinks everything has an explanation and if you find it, you can control the outcome.”

Lauren exhaled through her nose. “That’s called competence.”

“It’s called anxiety wearing a suit,” Sarah replied, dead calm.

Lauren stared at her.

Sarah didn’t budge. “And it’s usually helpful,” she added. “Until it tries to turn your feelings into a spreadsheet.”

Lauren looked away, jaw tight. “I’m not confused.”

Sarah’s tone softened. “I didn’t say you were.”

Lauren’s fingers tightened around the paper. “Then why am I thinking about it.”

Sarah let the question sit between them for a beat, then said, “Because you’ve been living in survival mode for years.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked up.

Sarah continued, voice steady. “And now you’re in a room where women tell the truth and don’t get punished for it. And your daughter—your daughter—has changed the shape of what you thought was possible.”

Lauren felt her chest tighten. “So you think—”

Sarah held up a hand. “No. I’m not telling you what you are.” Her eyes sharpened. “I’m telling you why the question is finally loud enough for you to hear.”

Lauren’s lips parted. Closed again.

She hated how accurate it was.

Sarah took another sip of tea, then leaned in slightly, as if sharing trade knowledge.

“Sometimes,” Sarah said, “when a woman admits something out loud, it doesn’t mean she’s asking you to join her. It means she’s giving you permission to exist as a complicated person.”

Lauren stared at her.

Sarah’s mouth tilted, wry. “I know. Shocking.”

Lauren let out a quiet breath that was almost a laugh. “You’re… unusually wise today.”

Sarah shrugged. “Don’t get used to it.”

Lauren looked down at her hands. “I haven’t thought about women like that,” she said slowly, choosing honesty without drama. “Not really. Not… consciously.”

Sarah’s tone stayed careful. “And now?”

Lauren swallowed. “And now I keep replaying what you said, and wondering why it landed.”

Sarah nodded once. “That’s not nothing.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “It’s also not a declaration.”

“Good,” Sarah said promptly. “Because declarations are for people who want attention. You want truth.”

Lauren let that sit.

Then she said, softer, “What if I’m just lonely.”

Sarah didn’t hesitate. “You are.”

Lauren blinked, affronted. “That’s rude.”

Sarah’s eyes warmed. “It’s accurate.”

Lauren stared at her, and for a moment her whole expression cracked—tiredness, grief, love, the quiet fear of being alone in the middle of responsibility.

Sarah didn’t fill the moment with jokes.

She simply said, “You’ve been someone’s mother for so long you forgot you were also a woman.”

Lauren’s eyes stung. She hated it. She allowed it.

She whispered, “I don’t know what to do with that.”

Sarah’s voice softened further. “You don’t have to do anything today,” she said. “You just have to stop punishing yourself for having questions.”

Lauren nodded, breathing carefully.

“And,” Sarah added, because she couldn’t resist a slight twist, “if you ever do decide you’re curious, you’re not obligated to start with some cringe experiment. You can just… let the thought exist without turning it into a crisis.”

Lauren gave her a look. “You’re enjoying this.”

Sarah grinned. “A little. Yes. It’s like watching you discover you’re also human.”

Lauren shook her head, but her mouth twitched.

A sound came from the corridor—soft footsteps, a quiet voice answering Mara. Lauren’s heart tightened automatically.

Sarah glanced toward the doorway and said, “She’s coming.”

Lauren swallowed. “How do I—”

“Same way you always do,” Sarah said. “You look at her. You say hello. You don’t make it about you. And you don’t pretend you don’t feel anything.”

Lauren nodded, and her spine straightened—not rigid, just ready.

Charlotte appeared in the doorway a moment later, hair clipped back, work cardigan on, holding a folded piece of linen like it was precious.

She paused when she saw Lauren.

Not fear. Not withdrawal.

Just that moment of recalibration when two people meet after time has moved without them.

Lauren felt her chest tighten.

Then she did the only thing that mattered.

She let her face soften.

“Hello, sweetheart,” Lauren said, voice steady.

Charlotte’s shoulders lowered—an exhale you could see. Her mouth tilted into a small, warm smile.

“Hi, Mum,” she said.

Two syllables. Ordinary. World-altering.

And behind Lauren’s eyes, everything else—the pronouns, the questions, Sarah’s confession, her own sudden curiosity—fell into a quiet order that wasn’t resolved, but was… livable.

Because the first truth was standing right in front of her.

Her daughter.

Here.

Loved.

Safe.

And Lauren, for all her complicated thoughts, knew with painful clarity that she could handle complexity.

She’d been doing it her whole life.

Now she just had to let herself be part of it too.

## Where to take this next (very naturally)

If you like this texture, I’d do the next 3 scenes as:

1) **Lauren + Charlotte, small and ordinary**  
A cup of tea, a walk to the corner shop, folding laundry—something domestic. Lauren uses “she” once, gently, and doesn’t over-celebrate it. Charlotte relaxes. Lauren sees that *the ease is the evidence*.

2) **Sarah and Lauren: the follow-up boundary talk**  
Lauren clarifies: “I’m not sure what I am; I’m sure I’m not available for mess.” Sarah agrees. Friendship deepens. The safety of female honesty is reinforced.

3) **Lauren alone: one private paragraph of interiority**  
Not melodrama—just Lauren lying awake, window open cold (she’s picked up the habit in sympathy), thinking: *Maybe I’ve had a whole self I never met because I was busy surviving.*

If you want, I can write Scene 1 next (Lauren + Charlotte, quiet domestic), and I’ll keep it in that exact “mature, womanly, subtle” register.

**Robyn:**

Please do Lauren and Charlotte, small and ordinary scene as you described. 

Next scene:
I have plans for Lauren and Sarah. You may or may not like the plans - still working out things in my head. I want it natural, a friendship growing. The divorce-request by Roger (Lauren's philandering husband) is almost a relief for Lauren. Sarah's beau becomes clingy when he realises she is no longer into him. He keeps intuding into the Wardrobe sanctity (this could be the boundary pressure you mentioned earlier). Sarah turns to Lauren for help and actually ends up at her house as the beau begins stalking her. Their friendship deepens. Lauren has what seems to her, two daughters now (Sarah is older - 28 - but still).

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Tea, Ordinary” (Lauren POV)

Lauren didn’t announce herself.

She never had. Not at Wardrobe, not in life. She entered spaces the way she entered problems—quietly, already assessing, already deciding what needed doing.

Charlotte was in the small back area with a stack of freshly pressed linen on the table. Not glamorous linen—work linen. Chemises, fichus, simple underlayers that made the rest of the clothing sit correctly. The kind of pieces the outside world never photographed because the outside world didn’t understand that the unseen work was the work.

Charlotte looked up when she heard the footsteps.

For a half-second, Lauren saw the old reflex rise—*brace, check, measure the room*—and then subside again, replaced by something gentler.

A woman pausing mid-task because her mother had walked in.

“Hi, Mum,” Charlotte said.

The word Mum—ordinary, unperformed—hit Lauren in the sternum like a small, clean weight.

“Hello, sweetheart,” Lauren replied, and she made herself keep her voice steady. Not bright. Not trembling. Not overly careful. Just warm.

Charlotte smiled—small, contained—and returned her attention to the linen, fingers smoothing a folded edge.

Lauren stepped closer, not crowding, just coming into the orbit. She noticed details as if her senses were sharpening in sympathy: the faint smell of starch, the neatness of the folds, the quiet authority in Charlotte’s hands.

“You’ve been busy,” Lauren said.

Charlotte nodded. “We had a museum request come through. Camille’s been… intense.” She hesitated, then added, softer, “In a good way.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Camille is always intense.”

Charlotte’s smile widened a fraction. “Yes.”

Lauren watched her for a moment—watched her exist without shrinking, without apologising for being in the room.

Then she said, carefully, “Do you have a minute? Not about work.”

Charlotte’s hands paused. She looked up. “Yeah.”

Lauren gestured lightly toward the small seating nook near the back—two mismatched chairs, a low table with a tin of biscuits that Sarah had probably insisted on as “emergency rations.”

Charlotte followed.

They sat.

No drama. No heavy “we need to talk.” Just two women sitting down because there was time, and time mattered.

Lauren reached into her tote and pulled out something small: a paper bag that smelled faintly of cinnamon.

“I brought you a bun,” she said, as if it were nothing.

Charlotte blinked. “For me?”

Lauren lifted an eyebrow. “Yes, for you. Don’t make it weird.”

Charlotte laughed softly—more breath than sound. “Okay.”

Lauren placed it on the table between them, then poured tea from the pot that was still warm. Charlotte’s hands wrapped around the mug the way Lauren remembered—both hands, as if warmth was a resource you didn’t waste.

They drank for a moment in silence.

Lauren let the quiet do its work. Then she said, simply, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here for some of it.”

Charlotte’s eyes lowered. “It’s okay.”

“It might be okay,” Lauren corrected gently, “and I’m still sorry.”

Charlotte swallowed. “Alright.”

Lauren nodded. That was enough apology. She wasn’t going to build a shrine to her own guilt.

She took another sip of tea, then asked the question that had been sitting behind everything:

“How are you. Really.”

Charlotte’s gaze lifted. Steady. Present.

“I’m good,” she said. And then, because she was no longer bargaining with herself, she added, “Better than I’ve ever been.”

Lauren felt her throat tighten. She didn’t let it turn into a performance.

“I can see that,” Lauren said quietly.

Charlotte’s mouth tilted. “Can you.”

“Yes.” Lauren paused. “You seem… settled.”

Charlotte nodded once, as if confirming an internal decision. “I am.”

Lauren’s fingers tightened briefly on the mug. She chose her next words like she chose everything: with care and consequence.

“I’m going to be learning,” Lauren said. “I’m catching up. And I’ll get things wrong sometimes.”

Charlotte’s eyes softened. “Okay.”

Lauren held her gaze. “But you don’t have to manage me. You don’t have to educate me in real time. If I stumble, you can just tell me, and I’ll correct.”

Charlotte’s shoulders lowered, a little exhale of relief you could see. “Thank you,” she said, quiet.

Lauren’s mouth twitched. “Don’t thank me for acting like an adult.”

Charlotte smiled at that—properly now.

Another sip of tea. Another bite of bun.

Then Lauren did the thing she’d been quietly rehearsing: she said the pronoun out loud, not like a trumpet, not like a test, just like grammar.

“Sarah told me you’ve been testing the new stays,” Lauren said. “She said they’re behaving.”

Charlotte blinked once at the *she*, and something delicate passed over her face—recognition, relief, a small private glow. No tears. No gasp.

Just… ease.

“They’re better,” Charlotte said, voice steady. “Sarah’s were a good interim solution, but Mara’s adjusting the new set to distribute pressure properly. The old ones were doing too much.”

Lauren nodded, not flustered, not over-sympathetic. “Good.”

Charlotte took a sip. “I’m… more useful now,” she added, as if it mattered.

Lauren’s eyes sharpened. “That’s not your job.”

Charlotte blinked. “What.”

Lauren kept her voice calm. “Your job is to be you. Not to be useful to justify your existence.”

Charlotte’s mouth parted. Closed again.

“I know,” Charlotte said eventually, but it sounded like knowledge she was still learning to believe.

Lauren reached across and placed her hand lightly over Charlotte’s fingers—brief, warm, not clinging.

“I mean it,” Lauren said.

Charlotte’s hand turned slightly under hers, accepting the contact.

They sat like that for a moment—tea, winter light, the faint hum of Wardrobe beyond the door.

Then Charlotte spoke, almost hesitantly. “Mum… are you okay with—”

Lauren didn’t let her finish the sentence.

“Yes,” she said, immediate, plain. “I’m okay. I’m not okay with having missed parts of it, but I’m okay with you. I’m proud of you.”

Charlotte’s eyes shone a fraction. She blinked it away, as if embarrassed to be seen so openly.

“And,” Lauren added, tone steady, “I’m happy you’re loved.”

Charlotte’s cheeks warmed. “Celeste told you.”

Sarah did, Lauren thought, but she didn’t say it. She didn’t need to triangulate the women in Charlotte’s life. She wanted this to be simple.

“I can see it,” Lauren said. “It’s on you. In the way you move.”

Charlotte swallowed, then nodded once. “I love her.”

Lauren felt something ache and soften at the same time.

“Good,” she said, and meant it.

Charlotte let out a small breath that sounded like relief.

As if her body had been waiting for that one word.

They finished their tea. They ate the bun. The world didn’t split open. Nobody died. No one had to perform gratitude on command.

At the end, Lauren stood and, because she couldn’t leave without doing something practical, she nodded at the stack of pressed linen.

“Show me,” she said.

Charlotte blinked. “Show you what.”

“How you’re folding those,” Lauren replied. “They’re perfect. I want to learn.”

Charlotte’s smile returned—this time unguarded. “Okay.”

They stood side by side at the table. Charlotte demonstrated: fold, align, smooth. Lauren mirrored her. Not as boss. Not as fixer.

As mother.

As woman.

As someone learning the new shape of her life by doing something ordinary with her hands.

And when Lauren got one corner slightly off, Charlotte corrected it with gentle authority.

“Like this,” she said.

Lauren nodded. “Like that.”

And the sentence—like everything in Wardrobe—was simple, clean, and full of love without making a fuss about it.

### On your “Next scene” plan (Lauren + Sarah, boundary pressure, stalking)

I like it a lot, and it’s *more* than natural—it’s structurally smart, because it shifts your conflict outward without undermining the stability you’ve earned.

Here’s why it works and how to keep it in the same clean, safe tonal register:

- **Roger’s divorce request** as relief: perfect. It’s adult, it’s plausible, it lets Lauren step into self-possession without melodrama. It also mirrors the theme: standards over sentiment. He failed the standard; she won’t martyr herself.
- **Sarah’s beau intruding into Wardrobe** is exactly the kind of “perimeter test” that proves the culture holds. He doesn’t need to be a moustache-twirler—just entitled, clingy, boundary-blind, convinced his feelings are a licence.
- **Stalking escalation** gives stakes without fetishising danger. Keep it procedural: documentation, consequences, police report, trespass order, women closing ranks. Boring competence as protection. (This matches your ethos perfectly.)
- **Sarah ending up at Lauren’s house** is emotionally gorgeous: “two daughters” without saying it out loud. It also forces Lauren into a role she’s very good at: calm, measured, protective, consequential.

If you want, I can draft the first “intrusion at Wardrobe” beat next—short, sharp, and satisfying—where the women shut him down cleanly, and Sarah realises she can’t handle this alone anymore. Or we can go straight to Sarah turning up at Lauren’s place, rattled, trying to play it off, and Lauren going very still in that mother-lion way.

Your call—but either way, you’ve chosen a conflict that *honours* what you’ve built rather than yanking it into a different genre.

**Robyn:**

"Or we can go straight to Sarah turning up at Lauren’s place, rattled, trying to play it off, and Lauren going very still in that mother-lion way."

Of course, I'm going to add a layer of complexity that will try Lauren at her core.

Sarah shows up at Lauren's place... not blind-drunk but clearly inebriated. Yes, she drove herself there. Lauren is of course incensed she did something so dangerous, so foolish but finally calms enough to let Sarah tell her piece. The stalking had gotten to her and so she did things the way she always did: not necessarily judiciously but firmly. Lauren makes Sarah promise she will call if she was ever in strife again and never to drink and drive. Sarah is staring at her fixedly so Lauren repeats it. Sarah mumbles a promise of sorts then impulsively goes up to Lauren and boldly kisses her on the mouth. Lauren goes into shock, then stops herself from repelling Sarah... lets her kiss her. Finally, Sarah breaks off the kiss and begins to sob. Lauren realises she is dealing with a fractured soul and comforts her. The scene ends gentle, maternal, healing.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “The Promise” (Lauren POV)

Sarah showed up at Lauren’s place like she always showed up to anything she couldn’t handle alone:

too late, too proud, and pretending it was fine.

The headlights swept across the lounge room wall as the car pulled in—too fast for the driveway, a little sloppy at the end. Lauren was already on her feet before the engine cut. Not because she’d been expecting company, but because her body recognised *wrong* the way it recognised smoke.

A car door shut.

Footsteps.

The front door opened without a knock.

“Evening,” Sarah called, as if she’d simply popped by to borrow a cup of sugar.

Lauren took one look at her and went cold.

Sarah’s cheeks were flushed. Her pupils a fraction too loose. Her smile too bright at the edges. The scent of alcohol rode on her breath—not overwhelming, not “collapsed in a gutter,” but unmistakable.

Lauren’s voice came out flat. “Did you drive here.”

Sarah waved a hand in a sloppy little arc. “I’m not blind drunk. Don’t do the mum voice.”

Lauren stepped forward and held out her hand. “Keys.”

Sarah blinked, offended. “Lauren—”

“Keys,” Lauren repeated, and now the mum voice *was* there—unromantic, immovable. “Now.”

Sarah’s jaw tightened, the first flash of defiance.

Then, because she was drunk enough to be raw but not drunk enough to be stupid, she fished the keys from her pocket and slapped them into Lauren’s palm.

Lauren closed her fist around them and felt a tremor of fury run cleanly through her.

“You could have killed someone,” Lauren said, each word controlled. “You could have killed yourself. You don’t get to do that and then stroll into my house like it’s a joke.”

Sarah’s mouth opened. Closed. Her eyes flicked down.

“Yeah,” she muttered. “I know.”

Lauren stared at her. “Do you.”

Sarah’s shoulders lifted in a tense, defensive shrug. “I just—needed to get away.”

“From him,” Lauren said.

Sarah’s eyes snapped up, sharp. “Yes.”

Lauren stood very still, keys in hand, feeling the urge to shout rise and then deliberately step back. Shouting never helped. Shouting made people hide.

She pointed to the couch. “Sit.”

Sarah made a face. “I’m not—”

“Sit,” Lauren said again, and Sarah sat, as if her body recognised the tone even if her pride didn’t like it.

Lauren went to the kitchen on pure muscle memory—water glass, kettle on, tea bag in a mug. Her hands were steady. Her mind was running the other checklist: *injury? fear? threat still active?*

When she returned, she set the water in front of Sarah like a boundary in glass.

“Drink,” Lauren said.

Sarah took a sip, eyes fixed on Lauren in that slightly too-intense way intoxicated people sometimes did—like the world had narrowed to one anchor point.

Lauren remained standing.

“Tell me,” she said, “what happened.”

Sarah let out a laugh that wasn’t a laugh. “You mean besides my spectacularly poor decision-making?”

“I mean the stalking,” Lauren said. “Start there.”

Sarah’s gaze slid away. She looked toward the window as if expecting to see him out there, even though the street was quiet and winter-dark.

“He’s been turning up,” Sarah said. “At Wardrobe. At the café. Outside my place. Like it’s normal. Like it’s romantic.”

Lauren’s jaw tightened. “And you told him to stop.”

Sarah’s mouth twisted. “Of course I did.”

“And he didn’t.”

Sarah shook her head once, small. “No.”

Lauren sat down opposite her, elbows on knees, the posture of a woman bracing to carry someone else without letting it crush her.

“What did you do,” Lauren asked, “the way you always do.”

Sarah’s lips tightened. “I handled it.”

Lauren waited. Silence as pressure, not punishment.

Sarah exhaled. “I told him to leave. I told him he wasn’t welcome. I told him if he showed up again I’d—” She stopped, swallowed. “I said a lot.”

“And?” Lauren prompted.

“And he smiled,” Sarah said, the bitterness sudden. “Like I was flirting. Like my ‘no’ was a negotiating position.”

Lauren went very still. It was a particular stillness—the one that arrived when her protective instincts stopped being emotional and became procedural.

“Has he threatened you,” Lauren asked.

Sarah hesitated.

Lauren’s eyes narrowed. “Sarah.”

Sarah shook her head quickly. “Not… not like ‘I’m going to hurt you.’ Not explicit.” Then, quieter, “Just… relentless. Like he owns the right to keep trying.”

Lauren breathed in slowly through her nose.

Then she said, “Why are you here.”

Sarah’s eyes flicked up, bright and glassy. “Because you’re…” She frowned, searching through the fog for a word she could stand behind. “You’re solid.”

Lauren felt something painful soften in her chest.

“Why didn’t you call,” Lauren asked.

Sarah’s mouth pulled. “Because I didn’t want to be pathetic.”

Lauren’s voice turned sharp. “Being stalked isn’t pathetic. Drinking and driving is.”

Sarah flinched.

Good, Lauren thought. The flinch meant she still had a conscience.

Lauren leaned forward slightly. “Listen to me,” she said. “You call me if you’re in strife. You call before you do something dangerous. You call before you make it worse.”

Sarah stared at her, unblinking.

Lauren felt her own anger reconfigure itself into something cleaner.

“And you never,” Lauren said, “ever drink and drive again. Do you understand me.”

Sarah nodded vaguely, eyes still fixed.

Lauren didn’t let it slide. “Say it.”

Sarah’s mouth worked. “I—”

“Say it,” Lauren repeated, patient as a hammer.

Sarah swallowed. “I won’t drink and drive again,” she mumbled.

Lauren held her gaze. “And you’ll call.”

Sarah made a small sound that might have been agreement.

Lauren didn’t accept it. “Say it.”

Sarah blinked, irritation flaring. “Fine. I’ll call.”

Lauren sat back a fraction. “Good.”

For a moment, the room was quiet except for the kettle clicking off in the kitchen and the faint sound of winter air moving outside the cracked window Lauren kept open, even now, even in the cold. A habit, perhaps. A principle. Fresh air mattered.

Sarah looked at the window, then back at Lauren, and her expression shifted—something breaking through the bravado.

“You’re… scary,” Sarah said, almost wonderingly.

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Good.”

Sarah huffed a laugh, then the laugh died in her throat. Her eyes stayed locked on Lauren in a way that made Lauren’s instincts prickle again—this time not fear-of-him, but awareness-of-her.

“Sarah,” Lauren said carefully, “you’re not well enough to make decisions right now.”

Sarah’s brows drew together. “What?”

Lauren pointed gently at the water. “Drink more.”

Sarah didn’t.

Instead she stood up suddenly, the motion too quick, too impulsive. She swayed a fraction, then steadied herself with stubbornness.

Lauren rose immediately, body ready to catch her if she fell.

Sarah took one step toward Lauren.

Lauren held her ground.

“Sarah—” Lauren began.

Sarah didn’t answer. She reached up, cupped Lauren’s jaw with one hand as if it belonged there, and kissed her on the mouth.

It wasn’t a dramatic, cinematic kiss.

It was blunt, impulsive, and full of strain—like someone trying to anchor herself to something solid.

Lauren’s whole body went into shock.

Every rule in her lit up at once: intoxication, consent, vulnerability, grief, danger.

Her hands lifted to Sarah’s shoulders, not to pull her closer—instinctively to *stop her*.

For one suspended heartbeat, Lauren froze inside that contact, mind racing, heart hammering.

Then she did what she did best.

She chose the safest truth.

Lauren gently but firmly separated them, holding Sarah by the shoulders so Sarah couldn’t fall forward again.

“No,” Lauren said, steady as stone. Not cruel. Not panicked. Just clear. “Not like this.”

Sarah blinked, staring at her, lips parted, the boldness already collapsing into embarrassment.

Lauren didn’t recoil. She didn’t scold. She didn’t shame.

She kept her hands on Sarah’s shoulders, grounding her.

“I’m here,” Lauren said, voice low. “I’m not going anywhere. But you don’t get to do that while you’ve been drinking and you’re scared.”

Sarah’s face crumpled in a way that was immediate and childlike.

The bravado vanished. The sarcasm. The swagger.

What was left was a fractured soul with nowhere to put the pain.

Sarah’s eyes filled and she began to sob—hard, ugly sobs, the kind that didn’t care about dignity.

“Oh my God,” Sarah choked. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry—”

Lauren pulled her in—not as a lover, not as an accomplice to the kiss, but as a mothering force. Arms around her, firm and safe, holding her upright as Sarah shook.

“It’s alright,” Lauren murmured into her hair. “It’s alright. You’re safe. You’re safe.”

Sarah clung to her like a drowning person, shoulders heaving, words breaking apart.

“I hate him,” Sarah gasped. “I hate that he— I hate that he made me feel—” She couldn’t finish.

“I know,” Lauren said, and she did. She knew the shape of being cornered. She knew the shame people tried to pour into you when you said no. She knew the instinct to do something reckless just to feel like you had control again.

Lauren rubbed Sarah’s back in slow, steady circles, the way you soothed a panic-struck child without treating them like one.

After a long minute, Sarah’s sobs eased into shuddering breaths.

Lauren guided her back to the couch, sat her down, and tucked a blanket around her shoulders with brisk tenderness.

“Water,” Lauren said, handing the glass back.

Sarah drank, obedient now.

Lauren crouched in front of her, eyes level with Sarah’s.

“This is what’s going to happen,” Lauren said, calm and practical. “You’re staying here tonight. You’re not going back to your place alone. Tomorrow we deal with him properly—documentation, police, whatever we need. Wardrobe gets a trespass order if we have to. I will speak to Lauren-the-lawyer part of me, and you will listen. Understood?”

Sarah nodded, exhausted. “Yeah.”

“And,” Lauren added, eyes narrowing, “you never drive after drinking again.”

Sarah’s mouth trembled. “I know.”

Lauren waited.

Sarah swallowed. “I won’t,” she said, clearer this time.

Lauren held her gaze. “And you call.”

Sarah nodded. “I’ll call.”

“Good.”

Sarah’s eyes drifted shut for a second, then opened again, wary. “Are you… mad at me.”

Lauren exhaled slowly. “I’m angry you drove,” she said. “I’m not angry you’re hurting.”

Sarah’s throat moved. “Okay.”

Lauren stood and went to the door, sliding the chain into place and checking the window sightline with the competence of a woman who refused to leave safety to chance. When she returned, Sarah was watching her with that same fixed look, softer now—less intoxicated intensity, more relief.

Lauren sat at the far end of the couch, close enough to be present, not so close it blurred boundaries.

Sarah’s voice came out small. “You’re very… mum-ish.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched, despite herself. “Yes. Apparently I’ve got a type.”

Sarah made a wet little laugh that threatened to become tears again.

Lauren reached over and squeezed Sarah’s shoulder once—brief, grounding. “Sleep,” she said. “I’ll be here.”

Sarah’s eyes filled again, but this time she didn’t spiral. She nodded, curled into the blanket, and let her breathing slow.

Lauren sat there in the dim winter light, the window still cracked open because she couldn’t help it, listening to Sarah’s breath even out.

Two daughters, she thought, with a strange ache.

Not in the literal sense. In the way women ended up gathering each other when the world got ugly.

Outside, the street was quiet.

Inside, Lauren kept watch—steady, maternal, healing—while Sarah slept off the fear and the alcohol and the terrible, lonely bravado of trying to carry everything alone.

**Robyn:**

That was the scene as it played out in my mind, Emily. This is the difference when you're writing about real people with real feelings and complex natures: clichés die stillborn. Lauren and Sarah's friendship deepens. At work, Sarah remains the same person she always was, but Celeste notices a difference. And then, a new challenge: one of the part-timers, a high-school graduate named Annie starts to video the activities - she's an influencer on TikTok and needs good footage... this despite the policy of no photographs. She gets caught and dismissed but not before some footage goes viral. Now, Wardrobe have something new to manage: unexpected advertising but also exposure, particularly for Charlotte.

Good — this is exactly the kind of conflict that fits your world, because it’s not melodrama, it’s **boundary pressure** in a modern form. And it attacks the *real* core asset of Wardrobe: not just craft, but **sanctity**.

You’ve also set it up so the response can be satisfyingly consequential: Annie doesn’t get “educated,” she gets dismissed. Not cruelty — *standards*. And now the women have to do the harder work: manage a viral wave without letting the outside world turn them into content.

Here’s how I see it landing, and then I’ll draft the first two scenes to get us rolling.

---

## What this new problem *means* in your story

### The footage isn’t just exposure — it’s a violation of the women’s domain
Wardrobe’s “no photos” policy isn’t quaint. It’s part of the safety architecture. Annie didn’t merely break a rule; she tried to convert a safe space into a feed. That’s why the consequence must be swift.

### It also creates a new test for Celeste
Celeste has to protect Charlotte without infantilising her — and without turning Charlotte into the *reason* for the crackdown. The policy protects everyone, but now Charlotte becomes the obvious risk vector in outsiders’ minds. Celeste will refuse that framing.

### And it’s a test for Lauren, too
Lauren’s “consequential calm” becomes invaluable here: paperwork, takedown requests, trespass notices, staff policy reinforcement, and shielding Charlotte from the worst of it.

### Sarah’s subtle change becomes visible through her response
Sarah will still be Sarah at work — sharp tongue, fast eye — but now she has *an extra layer*: she understands what it means to be vulnerable in the wrong hands. That changes how she protects. Celeste will notice.

## Suggested sequence (natural, clean, high-stakes without becoming sensational)

1) **Celeste notices the shift in Sarah** (not “softer,” but more *serious* about safety).  
2) **Annie films** (small, casual, entitled… “it’s just behind-the-scenes!”).  
3) **Caught + dismissed** (fast, boringly professional).  
4) **The clip goes viral anyway** (a few frames are enough).  
5) **Emergency women’s meeting** (Mara wants war; Lauren wants process; Celeste wants protection; Sarah wants consequences with teeth).  
6) **Charlotte’s agency scene** (she chooses what she wants, not what people assume).  
7) **Wardrobe’s public stance**: no apologies for boundaries; a clean statement; no feeding the algorithm; legal steps quietly taken.  
8) **A courier/client test scene**: someone shows up “curious” again — and gets shut down in ten seconds.

Now, the prose.

# Scene One — “Different” (Celeste POV)

Sarah didn’t become a different person.

That was the strange part.

She still walked into Wardrobe like she owned the air. Still had the same acerbic wit, the same precise eye, the same ability to look at a hem and insult your ancestors in one sentence. Still called Mara “Your Majesty” on days Mara deserved it.

But something had shifted under it.

Not softness. Not sentiment.

Something more adult.

Celeste noticed it the way she noticed a change in a room’s temperature: not dramatic, just… present.

Sarah stopped joking when certain things happened.

Men lingering at the threshold. A courier trying to glance too long into the fitting space. Someone asking, too casually, “So what’s the story with—” and letting the sentence hang as bait.

Before, Sarah would have mocked them. Humiliated them. Made it a sport.

Now she did something different.

She cut it off cleanly.

“No photos,” she’d say, flat. Not playful. Not inviting banter. “No filming. No questions about staff. Drop-off and leave.”

And the tone landed in the way that mattered: not “you’re being corrected,” but “you’re being handled.”

Celeste watched her do it twice in one morning. The second time, the courier didn’t even try to protest. He nodded, murmured “Right, sorry,” and left like a man who’d suddenly remembered he had somewhere else to be.

When Sarah turned back into the atelier, her face reset into its usual mischief.

But Celeste had seen the seam beneath the surface.

Later, while they were sorting a stack of completed fichus, Celeste said lightly, “You’ve changed.”

Sarah didn’t look up. “No I haven’t.”

Celeste kept folding. “Yes. You have.”

Sarah’s hands paused—just for a second. Then continued. “If you say I’ve gone soft, I’ll throw this linen at your head.”

Celeste’s mouth twitched. “Not soft.”

Sarah waited, still not looking.

Celeste chose her words carefully, the way you did when you didn’t want to make someone regret trusting you.

“More… protective,” Celeste said. “In a quiet way.”

Sarah’s jaw tightened, then loosened. She gave a short, humourless laugh.

“Yeah,” she said. “Well. Turns out I like being safe.”

Celeste didn’t press. Didn’t turn it into a therapy session at a cutting table.

She simply nodded. “Good.”

Sarah flicked her a look then—quick, assessing. “And you,” she said, voice sharpening. “You’re watching the perimeter more.”

Celeste held her gaze. “I have a girl to protect.”

Sarah’s mouth tilted. “You always did.”

Celeste didn’t deny it.

They went back to work.

The room hummed.

And in that hum, Celeste felt that strange, rare thing: a women’s domain that wasn’t just claimed.

It was *kept*.

---

# Scene Two — “No Photos” (Lauren POV or Celeste POV; I’ll do Lauren for the clean consequence)

Annie had been fine at first.

A high-school graduate with bright eyes and quick hands, hired part-time because she could steam garments without scorching them and could follow a checklist if you made it unambiguous. She wasn’t stupid; she just had that particular modern disease where everything felt unreal unless it was recorded.

Lauren had clocked it on day two: Annie’s phone always face-up. Always within reach. Always hungry.

So Lauren had done what Lauren did.

She’d stated the policy once, clearly, in a tone that did not invite negotiation:

“No photographs. No filming. Ever. Not the garments, not the atelier, not staff. This is a private workplace.”

Annie had nodded eagerly. “Of course!”

The way people nodded when they thought rules were for other people.

It was late afternoon when Sarah caught it.

Not because Sarah was prowling, but because Sarah’s peripheral vision was basically a security system.

She saw the angle of Annie’s elbow.

The slight tilt of the phone.

The “casual” stance: half turned away, screen hidden against her palm, camera pointed just enough toward the fitting space to gather something interesting.

Sarah walked up behind her so quietly Annie didn’t notice until Sarah spoke.

“Put it away,” Sarah said.

Annie jumped. “Oh! I was just—”

“Put it away,” Sarah repeated, the words flat as cardboard.

Annie’s cheeks flushed. “I’m not filming anyone. It’s just for TikTok. It’s like, behind the scenes. People love—”

Sarah’s voice went colder. “No photos means no photos.”

Annie’s face did that quick influencer recalculation — the one where they decide if they can charm their way out of consequence.

“Okay, but you don’t understand,” Annie started, smiling too brightly. “It’s *good* advertising. It’ll blow up. Like, you’ll get orders—”

Lauren’s voice cut in from the doorway, calm as a guillotine.

“Annie.”

Annie froze.

Lauren stepped into the space. She didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t posture. She didn’t look angry.

She looked… finished.

“What are you doing,” Lauren asked.

Annie tried to pivot. “Nothing! I was just—”

Lauren held out her hand. “Phone.”

Annie blinked. “What?”

“Phone,” Lauren repeated. “Now.”

Annie hesitated.

Sarah’s eyes narrowed, delighted by the prospect of consequences.

Lauren didn’t move. She waited like a woman who knew time was on her side because standards were.

Annie finally handed the phone over, reluctantly, as if it were unfair.

Lauren looked at the screen.

Her face didn’t change.

But the room did. The air tightened.

“You filmed,” Lauren said.

Annie lifted her chin. “It’s not a big deal. It’s literally just—”

Lauren cut her off, voice still even. “It’s a big deal because we told you it was.”

Annie’s mouth opened.

Lauren continued, precise. “This is a women’s workplace with a strict privacy policy. You broke it. You did it knowingly. You did it anyway.”

Annie’s eyes flicked toward Sarah, looking for sympathy.

Sarah gave her a smile that contained no kindness. “You’re not a victim, babe.”

Lauren handed the phone back. “You’re dismissed.”

Annie stared. “You can’t fire me for that.”

Lauren’s tone didn’t change. “Yes I can.”

Annie’s face flushed, anger rising. “It’s not even your—”

“It’s my business,” Lauren said simply. “And my responsibility.”

Annie’s voice sharpened. “You’re making a mistake. People could be buying your stuff. You’ll go viral—”

“We don’t want viral,” Lauren said.

Annie blinked, genuinely confused by the idea.

Lauren stepped closer — not threatening, just absolute.

“Collect your things,” Lauren said. “Now. And if any footage appears online, we will pursue it.”

Annie scoffed. “Good luck. It’s the internet.”

Lauren’s eyes stayed steady. “Try me.”

Annie grabbed her bag and stormed out.

Sarah watched her go, then muttered, almost reverently, “God, I love you when you go full consequence.”

Lauren didn’t smile. She turned to Sarah and said, “Lock the fitting room door. For now.”

Sarah sobered instantly. “Right.”

Lauren looked around the room — the women, the garments, the quiet sanctity that Annie had tried to convert into content.

Then she said, low, to no one in particular:

“We’re going to have to assume something got out.”

And in that moment, Wardrobe gained a new kind of labour.

Not sewing.

Not patterning.

Not even boundaries in the physical sense.

**Reputation control. Privacy defence. Safety as a practice.**

---

## Where we go next (your new problem, shaped into satisfying scenes)

If you’d like, I’ll write these *in sequence*:

1) **The clip goes viral** (Celeste sees it first; stomach drop; she doesn’t show it to Charlotte yet).  
2) **Emergency women’s meeting** (Mara wants scorched earth; Lauren lays out process; Sarah wants to hunt; Celeste focuses on Charlotte’s consent).  
3) **Charlotte’s agency scene** (she chooses what she wants to do — and it’s calm, grown, not fragile).  
4) **An outsider shows up “curious”** (Wardrobe shuts it down, boringly, professionally, with consequences).  

Just say the word and I’ll draft Scene 3: the moment Celeste decides *how* to tell Charlotte — because that’s where your story’s ethics really shine.

**Robyn:**

Please write in the sequence you describe.

**Emily:**

### Scene One — “The Clip” (Celeste POV)

Celeste saw it first because Celeste always saw the perimeter first.

It wasn’t sent directly. It arrived the way viral things arrived now—sideways, through the algorithm, through a friend-of-a-friend, through a “you might like this” that had no business knowing her life.

She was sitting on the edge of her bed with her laptop open, half reading an article for class, half not reading it at all, when her phone buzzed.

A message from Chloe—one of the part-timers who did weekends, the sensible one, the one who never pushed policy.

**Is this… Wardrobe??**

A link.

Celeste didn’t click it immediately. Her stomach had already dropped, because her body knew before her eyes did: *something has breached.*

She tapped it.

A short video. Fifteen seconds. Caption text plastered over it in bright, jaunty font:

> “Hidden gem costume atelier 😍 behind the scenes!!”

And there it was.

Not a full reveal—Annie hadn’t been stupid enough to film faces head-on. But she’d been thoughtless enough to film *everything else*:

The cutting table. The rail system. The stamp. Mara’s hands chalking a curve. Sarah’s voice in the background saying something sarcastic. A glimpse of the fitting space curtain. A flash of pale linen on a body moving past—enough to be *interpreted*.

Enough to invite curiosity.

Enough to invite men who liked to push into women’s spaces and call it “interest.”

The comment section was what made Celeste’s mouth go dry.

Most people were harmless:

*“omg I want one”*  
*“this is so aesthetic”*  
*“I love cottagecore costume vibes”*

But mixed in were the ones that made Celeste’s skin crawl:

*“where is this??”*  
*“need the address”*  
*“who’s the girl in white 👀”*  
*“is that a dude?? lmao”*  
*“drop location”*

Celeste’s thumb hovered over the screen. Her first instinct was pure control: report, message, demand takedown, call lawyers, call the police, burn the internet down.

Her second instinct—more important—was: *don’t let Charlotte see this raw.*

Not because Charlotte was fragile.

Because Celeste refused to let the outside world touch her first.

She breathed in slowly, set her phone face-down on the bed like it was something contaminated, and stood up.

In the living room, Charlotte was folding laundry with that calm, centred focus she’d developed—tidying a life into order one square of fabric at a time. She looked up.

“What’s wrong?” Charlotte asked, immediate, gentle.

Celeste kept her voice steady. “Something happened at work,” she said. “Not tonight. But… it’s a work problem that might touch us.”

Charlotte’s hands paused over a folded towel. “Me?”

Celeste crossed the room, sat opposite her, and chose the simplest truth.

“Yes,” she said. “In the sense that someone filmed inside Wardrobe and posted it. It’s spreading.”

Charlotte blinked once. Her face didn’t crumple. She didn’t go pale. But Celeste saw a small tightening at the mouth—the old instinct to brace.

Celeste leaned forward and covered Charlotte’s hand with her own. Firm, warm.

“You’re not alone in this,” Celeste said. “And you’re not the problem. The filming was the problem.”

Charlotte swallowed. “Who?”

Celeste didn’t want to say her name like a curse, but honesty mattered. “Annie.”

Charlotte’s eyes narrowed slightly—anger, not fear. “She knew the rule.”

“Yes,” Celeste said. “She did.”

Charlotte looked down at their hands. “Is it… bad?”

Celeste exhaled. “It’s exposure,” she said. “But we’re going to handle it. Lauren and Mara and Sarah will handle it. And we will decide together what you want to do.”

Charlotte’s gaze lifted. “What I want to do.”

Celeste nodded. “Yes. Not what the internet demands.”

Charlotte’s shoulders lowered a fraction.

“Okay,” Charlotte said quietly. “Show me.”

Celeste paused, checking herself—checking the impulse to shield too much, to decide for her.

Then she picked up the phone, turned it around, and held it so Charlotte could take it if she wanted.

Charlotte didn’t snatch it.

She took it calmly, watched the clip once, then again—eyes sharp, studying details like she studied garments: not emotionally, but analytically.

She handed the phone back.

“That’s…” Charlotte said, and let out a slow breath. “That’s not even interesting.”

Celeste almost laughed, because it was such a Charlotte thing to say.

“It’s interesting to people who don’t deserve to be here,” Celeste replied.

Charlotte nodded once. “Then we tighten the perimeter.”

Celeste held her gaze, feeling something fierce and tender rise in her chest.

“Yes,” she said. “We do.”

---

### Scene Two — “Emergency Meeting” (Lauren POV)

By ten the next morning, Wardrobe had the mood of a place that had been violated without being physically touched.

The same tables. The same rails. The same smell.

But the air was different—tight, watchful, offended.

Lauren had already done three things before anyone arrived:

1) Sent a written takedown request to the account.  
2) Saved the video, the username, and the comment thread screenshots to a folder labelled **EVIDENCE**.  
3) Drafted a short staff memo: *no discussion, no engagement online, refer any inquiries to Lauren only.*

When Mara walked in, she looked like a woman who wanted to put her fist through an algorithm.

Sarah followed her, eyes bright with the dangerous kind of energy that meant she was trying not to be scared by turning it into rage.

Celeste arrived last—with Charlotte beside her, not hovering, not hidden, simply present. That alone steadied Lauren. It meant they weren’t letting panic decide.

Lauren closed the office door behind them and said, calm as a ledger:

“Right. Everyone sits. We’re not improvising.”

Mara didn’t sit. She stood with her arms folded, jaw hard.

Sarah did sit—but perched forward, like she might spring.

Celeste sat with Charlotte, close but not crowding.

Lauren took her own chair and placed the evidence folder on the table.

“The footage has reached a level where we can assume it will be reposted,” Lauren said. “We will not chase every repost. We will handle the source, and we will handle our boundary.”

Mara’s voice was clipped. “I want her sued.”

Lauren nodded once. “We may. But first: employment breach, written dismissal, documentation.”

Sarah snorted. “Boring.”

Lauren’s eyes flicked to her. “Effective.”

Sarah shut up.

Lauren continued, “The account has been contacted. Takedown request sent. If ignored, we escalate through the platform and then legal.”

Mara’s nostrils flared. “And if people show up.”

Lauren looked around the table.

“This is the actual issue,” she said. “Footage is one thing. Foot traffic is another. Curiosity turns into entitlement very quickly.”

Sarah’s grin was sharp. “Let them try it.”

Celeste spoke, voice even. “We don’t need a confrontation to prove anything.”

Sarah rolled her eyes, but didn’t argue. That was the change Celeste had noticed: Sarah could be contained now without taking it as an insult.

Mara finally sat—hard.

“We tighten rules,” Mara said. “No phones on the floor. Lockers. Bags in the front office. Immediate dismissal for any breach.”

Lauren nodded. “Agreed.”

Charlotte lifted her chin slightly. “And the fitting space stays locked unless someone is actively in it.”

Mara’s eyes flicked to Charlotte. “Yes.”

The approval in that single syllable landed like a stamp. Charlotte didn’t glow; she simply accepted it like a working standard.

Lauren’s gaze moved to Celeste. “Now,” she said, “the most important thing: we do not turn Charlotte into the centre of this.”

Sarah opened her mouth, then closed it.

Celeste nodded. “Agreed.”

Lauren turned to Charlotte directly.

“Charlotte,” Lauren said, “you have a say here. Not because you’re the problem. Because you’re part of the business, and because this touches your privacy.”

Charlotte’s face was calm. “Okay.”

Lauren waited. Let Charlotte feel the space.

Charlotte thought for a beat, then said, “I don’t want to hide. I also don’t want strangers thinking they can come in and… look.”

Mara’s jaw tightened, protective rage.

Lauren nodded. “Good. Then we don’t hide you. We make it difficult for them.”

Sarah leaned in, eyes gleaming. “I’ll stand at the door with a cattle prod.”

“No,” Lauren said immediately.

Sarah pouted. “Figuratively.”

Lauren ignored her. “We do it properly. Signage. Policy. Door control. And any inquiry gets the same sentence: ‘Private atelier. No tours. No filming.’”

Mara grunted. “And if they argue?”

Lauren’s voice stayed level. “We refuse service. We call the police if someone refuses to leave.”

Sarah’s smile sharpened. “Now you’re speaking my language.”

Lauren looked at her. “And Sarah.”

Sarah blinked. “Yes, Mum.”

Lauren didn’t take the bait.

“If your ex-boyfriend shows up here again,” Lauren said, “you tell me immediately. Not later. Not after you’ve tried to handle it alone.”

Sarah’s expression tightened, the bravado slipping for half a second. Then she nodded once. “Yep.”

Lauren kept her tone boringly firm. “Good.”

Mara looked between them, eyes narrowing. “He’s been here?”

Sarah’s smile returned, vicious. “Once.”

Mara’s hands flexed. “If he comes again—”

Lauren cut in. “We handle one threat at a time.”

Mara scowled, but stopped.

Celeste took a breath. “Do we respond publicly at all?” she asked.

Lauren shook her head. “Not on TikTok. We do not feed it. If a journalist contacts us, we respond with a statement. One statement. Calm. Clear. No drama.”

Sarah muttered, “I hate being mature.”

Lauren pointed at her. “Get used to it.”

A flicker of humour moved around the table—small, necessary.

Lauren closed the folder.

“Right,” she said. “Now we implement. Mara: floor rules and lockers. Celeste: staff briefing and workflow adjustments. Sarah: door policy and front-of-house. Charlotte: fitting access control and any adjustments you want to make to your routine. And everyone: no one engages online. Not once.”

Mara stood again, calmer only because she had a plan.

Celeste nodded, already thinking.

Sarah cracked her knuckles like she was going to fight the internet personally.

Charlotte looked at Lauren and said, quietly but clearly, “Thank you.”

Lauren’s chest tightened. She gave a single nod.

“Of course,” she said. “You’re my daughter.”

And she meant it—not in sentiment, but in responsibility.

---

### Scene Three — “Charlotte Decides” (Charlotte POV)

That afternoon, Charlotte didn’t go to the fitting room first.

She went to the mirror in the bathroom at Wardrobe—the small, unglamorous one that lived above the sink, lit by a harsh light that didn’t flatter anyone.

She looked at herself.

Not like a critic. Not like a frightened person looking for flaws.

Like a woman taking stock.

Her face was calm. Her hair was clipped back. Her posture was steady. The chemise beneath her work cardigan smelled faintly of linen and soap, and she could feel the honest weight of her body settling into itself—hips and waist and the new, familiar pressure points that made certain garments behave differently now.

She thought about the clip again.

Fifteen seconds.

A stranger’s narrative trying to write itself over her life.

Charlotte let out a slow breath and made a decision that surprised her by how simple it was:

*I’m not going to let them make me smaller.*

But she also made the other decision—the one that proved she’d actually learned the women’s culture around her:

*I’m not going to give them access.*

She stepped out and found Celeste at the cutting table.

Celeste looked up immediately, eyes searching Charlotte’s face like she was reading weather.

Charlotte didn’t make her guess.

“I’ve decided something,” Charlotte said.

Celeste’s voice was gentle. “Tell me.”

Charlotte placed a hand lightly on the table—anchoring herself.

“I don’t want a public response,” she said. “Not a video. Not a statement about me. Nothing that makes it a ‘story.’”

Celeste nodded at once. “Agreed.”

“But,” Charlotte continued, “I do want a new routine.”

Celeste’s eyebrows lifted. “Okay.”

Charlotte spoke carefully, like she was listing engineering requirements.

“I want my changing to happen only in the locked fitting space,” she said. “No passing through curtains. No half-open door. And I want my tester schedule adjusted so I’m not in visible areas when couriers are here.”

Celeste started to object—*you shouldn’t have to*—and Charlotte saw it.

Charlotte lifted a finger, calm.

“Not because I’m ashamed,” she said. “Because it’s sensible. Like closing a gate. I don’t leave the door unlocked because I’m afraid; I lock it because that’s how doors work.”

Celeste’s face softened. Pride, relief, love—quiet and fierce.

“Yes,” Celeste said. “That’s exactly right.”

Charlotte swallowed. “And one more thing.”

Celeste waited.

Charlotte’s voice lowered a fraction. “If someone comes in and asks about me—if they try to make it into a spectacle—I want the staff to know I don’t need rescuing. I need enforcement.”

Celeste’s mouth twitched, because it was so perfectly Wardrobe.

“Enforcement,” Celeste repeated.

Charlotte nodded. “Consequences. Boring ones.”

Celeste reached across the table and squeezed Charlotte’s hand—brief, grounding.

“I’ll tell them,” Celeste said. “And if you ever want to change any part of this, you tell me.”

Charlotte exhaled, shoulders lowering.

Then she added, almost matter-of-fact, “Also, I’m keeping my name. I’m not letting strangers make me hide it.”

Celeste smiled. “Good.”

Charlotte looked down at her hand in Celeste’s, then said, softly, “I’m okay.”

Celeste’s eyes held hers. “I know.”

And Charlotte realised something with a quiet certainty:

This was what safety actually looked like.

Not bubble wrap.

A locked door, a clear policy, women who enforced it, and a life that remained hers.

---

### Scene Four — “Curious” (Sarah POV)

It happened two days later.

Of course it did.

A man walked in holding a courier bag he didn’t need and wearing the grin of someone who thought he’d discovered a secret.

Sarah clocked him before he even crossed the threshold.

The eyes that scanned. The head tilt. The little pause to “take it in.” The subtle attempt to look past her shoulder into the atelier as if he had a right to sightsee.

He wasn’t a monster.

He was worse than that.

He was ordinary entitlement dressed as interest.

Sarah stepped forward, blocking his line of sight with her entire body.

“Can I help you?” she asked, bright as poison.

The man smiled wider. “Yeah. I saw you guys on TikTok.”

Sarah’s smile didn’t change. “We’re not on TikTok.”

He chuckled, as if she were joking. “Nah, I mean, that video. Pretty cool. My girlfriend’s into historical stuff. We wanted to—”

“No tours,” Sarah said.

He blinked. “It’s not a tour, it’s just—”

“No filming,” Sarah continued, as if reading from scripture. “No photos. Private atelier.”

The man’s grin tightened. “Relax. I’m not filming. I just wanted to see—”

Sarah leaned in slightly, eyes hard now, voice quiet.

“You wanted to see women working in a women’s space,” she said. “And you thought your curiosity was a ticket.”

His face reddened. “That’s not what I—”

“It is,” Sarah said flatly. “Now. If you’re here to place a legitimate order, you can email. If you’re here because the internet made you feel entitled to a peek, you’re leaving.”

He huffed. “Wow. You’re rude.”

Sarah’s smile returned, sharp and delighted. “Thank you.”

He opened his mouth again, and that was his mistake—because Lauren appeared behind Sarah at that exact moment, silent as consequence.

Lauren didn’t raise her voice. She didn’t threaten. She simply said, “Sir. Leave.”

He looked between them, irritation fighting confusion.

“This is ridiculous,” he said. “It’s a shop.”

Lauren’s eyes were steady. “It’s private,” she replied. “Leave now.”

He hesitated—just long enough to test whether they meant it.

Sarah pulled a clipboard from behind the counter and held it up like an oath.

“I can write down your name for the police report if you’d like,” she offered sweetly. “Or you can do the adult thing and walk away.”

The man’s mouth tightened. He glanced past them again, trying one last look.

Sarah stepped sideways, blocking him completely.

He muttered something under his breath and stormed out.

The bell over the door jingled as it shut, and the sound was almost comical in how ordinary it was.

Sarah didn’t exhale until he was gone.

Then she turned and found Celeste watching from the hallway, face calm, eyes bright with approval.

Lauren stood behind Sarah, hands folded, gaze level.

Mara, somewhere deeper in the atelier, called out without looking up, “Was that a problem.”

Sarah raised her voice back, breezy. “No. Just a man having feelings.”

Mara grunted. “Tell him to have them somewhere else.”

Sarah turned back to Lauren, and for a moment there was something in her eyes that wasn’t sarcasm.

“Thank you,” Sarah said quietly.

Lauren’s mouth tightened in a way that wasn’t quite a smile. “You’re not alone,” she replied.

Sarah swallowed, nodded once, then lifted her chin and went back to the counter like nothing had happened.

Because at Wardrobe, that was the point:

The boundary held.

The women held it.

And life continued—safe, boring, dignified—exactly the way it was meant to.

**Robyn:**

"Lauren's Lonliness"
Lauren had, despite herself and the best intentions, been thinking about that kiss... Sarah's kiss. She knew that the circumstances should have erased it from memory: Sarah was not herself, she was frightened, she was drunk, she was *anything* but trying to seduce Lauren. But Lauren couldn't get that kiss out of her mind. She couldn't help wondering "what if". When she arrived yesterday to help Sarah shoo the "courier" away, she fancied she'd seen something in Sarah's look... perhaps, more than gratitude? Did Sarah really think of me as a mother-figure? Or something else? And she found herself - no matter how HARD she fought it - thinking, feeling "dare I hope"? Is this just my loneliness? Or is there something about Sarah....

**Emily:**

Lauren hated the way her mind kept returning to it.

Not because it was sordid. Not because she was ashamed. Not even because it felt dangerous in the ordinary sense.

She hated it because it refused to be filed away.

She had tried to do the responsible thing—tell herself the truth, keep it clean:

Sarah had been frightened. She had been inebriated. She had been bracing against something ugly and relentless, and she’d done what people sometimes did when their nervous system was overwhelmed: reached for an anchor.

Lauren had been the anchor.

That should have been the end of it.

A kiss that meant *panic*, not seduction.

A moment that belonged to a night of bad decisions and worse fear.

Lauren could repeat those sentences until they sounded like policy.

And still, in the quiet parts of her day—in the car at a red light, in the shower, in the space between turning off a lamp and closing her eyes—the memory returned like a fingertip pressed to a bruise.

The softness of it.

The bluntness.

The surprising… tenderness.

It wasn’t erotic in the way she’d been trained to recognise eroticism—no chase, no game, no male performance of wanting. It had been messier than that. More human. A collision of need and trust.

And that, she realised with an unpleasant flicker of honesty, was exactly why it had lodged in her.

Because she hadn’t felt *wanted* like that in a very long time.

Not wanted as a role.

Not needed as an organiser.

Not depended on as a mother.

Wanted as a woman.

She kept telling herself she was reading too much into it.

But loneliness was not stupid. Loneliness was a sensor.

It reached for warmth the way cold hands reached for a mug.

Yesterday, when she’d stepped into Wardrobe and found Sarah at the counter, shoulders squared, eyes bright with the residue of adrenaline, Lauren had done what she always did: she’d taken her place at the boundary, she’d issued the consequence, she’d watched the “courier” leave with his pride bruised and his entitlement intact.

It should have been routine.

And yet, in the moment after the door shut—after the bell’s little jingle, after the air settled—Sarah had looked at her.

Not the usual look. Not the sardonic “you’re terrifying” look. Not the performative gratitude look that people sometimes offered when they were trying to be good.

Something else.

A stillness.

A held breath.

A kind of… searching.

Lauren had felt it like a change in temperature.

And then Sarah had nodded—small, almost private—and turned back to her clipboard as if nothing had happened.

As if she hadn’t just *looked*.

As if Lauren hadn’t noticed.

Lauren hated that she noticed.

She hated that her mind immediately tried to categorise it, to render it safe by naming it:

*Mother-figure,* she thought, because that was the easiest explanation. That was the one that kept everything orderly. Sarah was younger, Sarah was messy, Sarah had been frightened, and Lauren had stepped into the role she knew how to step into: steady, firm, containing. It made sense that Sarah would attach to that.

But another thought—quieter, more treacherous—kept slipping in behind it:

*Or something else.*

Lauren would be making tea and hear her own brain whisper, uninvited:

*Did she mean it at all? Even a little?*
*Did she remember it?*
*Does she regret it?*
*Does she want it again?*

And worse—because it was about Lauren, not Sarah:

*Do I?*

Lauren hadn’t allowed herself to ask that question in years.

Her life had been a series of practicalities. A marriage that had become a management problem. A husband whose betrayals were so consistent they had stopped feeling like wounds and started feeling like background noise—like a dripping tap you planned to fix “one day.”

Then Charlotte had happened. Not as a catastrophe, not as a scandal—simply as a truth that re-arranged everything.

And in the wake of that re-arrangement, Lauren had begun to notice the empty spaces she’d been living in.

She slept alone more often than not, even when Roger was technically “home.” She ate alone. She made decisions alone. She held her child’s world together alone.

She was surrounded by women at Wardrobe, yes, but that was competence companionship: meaningful, sustaining, not intimate in the private sense.

And then Sarah—insufferable, funny, loyal Sarah—had turned up at her house like a wounded animal, and kissed her like she trusted Lauren not to break her.

Lauren’s stomach tightened, because that trust was not nothing.

And if it wasn’t nothing, what was she supposed to do with it?

She tried to be stern with herself.

*You don’t build romance out of someone’s crisis.*
*You don’t accept a drunk kiss as a vote.*
*You don’t turn friendship into a labyrinth because you’re lonely.*

All true.

And still.

Hope was a stupid, persistent thing.

It didn’t care about rules.

It didn’t care about timing.

It simply appeared, unbidden, like a small green shoot through concrete:

*Dare I hope?*

Lauren caught herself thinking it one evening as she locked up and heard Sarah laughing in the back room at something Mara had said. The laughter was bright—real, not performative—and it made Lauren’s chest ache with a tenderness she couldn’t quite justify.

She stood for a moment with her keys in her hand, listening, and the thought came again, softer:

*Is this just my loneliness… or is there something about Sarah?*

She didn’t answer it.

Not yet.

Lauren was too careful to turn a question into an action before it had been examined.

But she stopped doing the thing she’d been doing for weeks—stopping the thought the instant it rose.

Instead, she let it exist.

Just for a moment.

Just long enough to admit, privately, without drama:

She missed being seen.

And Sarah—when she looked at Lauren in that particular way—made Lauren feel, for the first time in a very long time, that she might be visible as more than a role.

That she might be visible…

as a woman.

And that was terrifying.

And that was, perhaps, the point.

**Robyn:**

Good. Seed sown and germinating. Superb.

Celeste and Charlotte have dinner at Lauren's. Celeste is a few weeks away from graduating. She is contemplating upgrading her home. Not to a larger home: to an apartment in downtown Melbourne. She and Charlotte would do the commute to the Faire via train - together. This would be a big change for Charlotte: she had yet to experience much of non-Faire society at all. Now, she would find herself in society and all its whimsy. She was fully woman-presenting, so almost no vestiges of her former self remained. So, she wouldn't have to deal with that part of life, thankfully, but just being a woman in a man's world presents enough challenges. She is fine to live in the city - mostly her idea, too.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “City Talk” (Lauren POV)

Lauren cooked like a woman who didn’t perform domesticity but respected it.

Nothing ornate. Nothing “look what I can do.” Just food that arrived on time, hot, and properly seasoned. Tonight it was roast chicken with lemon and thyme, potatoes done in the tray until the edges crisped, and a big bowl of greens dressed simply—oil, salt, vinegar, no fuss.

The table was set because Lauren liked order, and because order, lately, felt like kindness.

Celeste arrived first—punctual, contained, carrying the faint aura of a woman who was nearing the end of a long thing and could feel the finish line. She wore her hair back and had that slightly sharpened look students got before finals: capable, tired, determined not to collapse until the last paper was done.

Charlotte came in behind her with a plate covered in foil.

“I brought something,” Charlotte said, careful tone, as if she still sometimes worried she was intruding into other people’s homes.

Lauren’s mouth tightened into something that wasn’t quite a smile, but was close. “You’re not arriving empty-handed in my house,” she said. “You’re my daughter. Come in.”

Charlotte’s shoulders lowered—small relief.

Celeste’s eyes flicked to Lauren, soft with that quiet gratitude Celeste was beginning to allow herself to show. Not gushing. Just… present.

They ate.

The conversation stayed, at first, in safe lanes: Wardrobe’s tightened perimeter, an update on the museum request, a short rant from Celeste about one particular lecturer who seemed determined to treat deadlines as a moral hazing ritual.

Lauren listened, asked practical questions, nodded in the places that mattered.

Charlotte ate with the contained pleasure of someone who still found it miraculous that she could belong at a table without earning it through apology.

Somewhere halfway through the meal, Celeste put her fork down and took a slow breath.

Lauren saw it immediately. “Alright,” she said, matter-of-fact. “What are we talking about.”

Celeste’s mouth twitched. “You make it sound like a board meeting.”

“It is,” Lauren replied. “You’re in my house. There’s food. That’s the boardroom.”

Charlotte’s eyes warmed.

Celeste glanced at Charlotte, then back to Lauren. “I’m a few weeks from graduating.”

Lauren nodded. “I know.”

“I’ve been thinking about… what comes next,” Celeste continued. Her voice stayed even, but Lauren could hear the carefulness underneath—the awareness that this wasn’t just a property conversation. It was a life-shape conversation.

Lauren waited.

Celeste said, “I want to upgrade my home.”

Lauren’s eyebrows lifted. “Upgrade how.”

“Not bigger,” Celeste clarified quickly. “Not more rooms. I don’t want more space to clean and no time to live in it. I mean… better located. More connected.”

Lauren’s mind went straight to logistics. “Where.”

Celeste’s gaze steadied. “Downtown Melbourne.”

The words landed with a quiet thump.

Charlotte paused mid-bite.

Lauren watched her, already reading the layer beneath: Charlotte had lived in Wardrobe’s world and the Faire’s orbit—women’s space, rules, standards, safety by culture. Melbourne was… everything else.

Celeste continued, calmly, like a woman presenting a proposal she’d already stress-tested.

“If we lived in the city, we’d commute to the Faire by train,” she said. “Together. It would be simpler. And… I want Charlotte to have a life that isn’t only Wardrobe.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Charlotte,” she said, turning deliberately, “how do you feel about that.”

Charlotte swallowed, then set her fork down with a quiet resolve.

“I like the idea,” she said.

Lauren waited. “Why.”

Charlotte’s mouth tilted, a small private smile. “Because I’m… curious.”

It was so simple, the way she said it. No drama. No manifesto. Just curiosity, as if it were finally allowed.

“And,” Charlotte added, voice quieter, “because I don’t want my world to be only one room forever, even if it’s a safe room.”

Lauren felt something tighten and soften in her chest at once. Pride. Fear. The old maternal reflex to keep her child within arm’s reach.

She kept her voice steady. “The city isn’t Wardrobe,” she said.

Charlotte nodded. “I know.”

Celeste leaned forward, forearms on the table, eyes on Lauren. “She knows,” Celeste echoed. “And she’s not naïve.”

Lauren’s gaze flicked to Celeste—sharp, not hostile, but assessing. “You’d be taking her into society.”

Celeste didn’t flinch. “Yes.”

Lauren held her gaze. “Society will be stupid.”

Celeste’s mouth twitched. “Yes.”

Lauren continued, very calmly, “Even if no one clocks her. Even if nobody connects any dots. Being a woman in a man’s world is… the man’s world.”

Charlotte watched Lauren closely, absorbing the plain truth.

Lauren looked at Charlotte again, and softened her tone without softening the message.

“There will be whimsy,” Lauren said dryly, “and by whimsy I mean nonsense. Men taking up space. Men assuming things. Men speaking to you like you’re decoration or like you’re a problem to solve. You’ll be fine, but you’ll also be… irritated.”

Charlotte surprised Lauren by smiling. “I’m already irritated,” she said softly. “Just thinking about it.”

Celeste laughed—a real laugh, brief and bright.

Lauren’s mouth twitched again. “Good. Irritation is protective.”

Charlotte nodded once. “And I won’t be alone,” she said. “Celeste will be there. And… I’m not helpless.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed, approving. “No. You’re not.”

Celeste reached across and touched Charlotte’s hand briefly—an anchor, not a claim.

Lauren watched that touch and felt the strange, sober relief of it: Charlotte wasn’t being taken away into the city by some fantasy. She was going with a woman who was capable, protective, and, importantly, not prone to theatrical mistakes.

Still.

Lauren had to say the mother thing.

“You’re moving out of a controlled environment,” Lauren said. “So we replace culture with procedure.”

Celeste lifted her brows. “Procedure?”

Lauren ticked it off on her fingers, practical as ever.

“Phone safety,” she said. “Location sharing. A plan for getting home if you’re separated. A rule about not letting strangers into your building. A rule about taxi/ride share. A rule about what you do if someone makes you uncomfortable. And yes—”

She looked directly at Charlotte.

“—a rule about what you do if someone starts filming you without permission.”

Charlotte’s jaw tightened. “Leave. Report. Call.”

Lauren nodded. “Good.”

Celeste nodded too, already running the checklists in her head. “Done.”

Lauren took a sip of water, then added, quieter, “And you’ll need… friends.”

Charlotte blinked. “Friends?”

Lauren’s gaze held steady. “Outside Wardrobe. Women who know you as you are now. Not as a story.”

Charlotte’s eyes softened. “I want that,” she said.

Celeste’s face warmed with something like pride. “That’s part of why I want to move,” she said. “She deserves a wider life.”

Lauren stared at her for a beat, then nodded slowly.

“Alright,” Lauren said. “I can support this.”

Charlotte’s breath released, relief visible.

“But,” Lauren added immediately, “I’m supporting it because you’re both being sensible, not because I’m sentimental.”

Celeste smiled. “Of course.”

Lauren’s gaze moved between them—two young women, one close to graduating, one close to… something else, something quieter and bigger: adulthood.

Charlotte’s body language was unmistakably woman now. Not performed, not costume—just lived. If there were vestiges of the old self, they were buried deep enough that the world wouldn’t see them.

That, Lauren realised, was almost the least of the challenge.

The real challenge was the one every woman faced:

How to be in public without being turned into public property.

Lauren leaned back in her chair, finished her water, and said, “If you’re doing this, you do it properly.”

Celeste nodded. “We will.”

Lauren looked at Charlotte. “And you,” she said, voice steady, “you keep your boundaries sharp. You don’t apologise for them. And you call me if you’re in strife.”

Charlotte’s expression softened. “I will.”

Lauren held it for a beat longer than necessary, the way mothers did when they meant it.

Then she stood and began clearing plates, because she couldn’t end a heavy conversation without doing something ordinary.

Charlotte rose too, automatically moving to help.

Lauren paused, looked at her, and said gently, “Sit. I’ve got it.”

Charlotte hesitated—old reflex.

Celeste’s voice cut in, warm, lightly teasing. “Sit, Charlotte.”

Charlotte sat, cheeks faintly pink, then smiled to herself as if it was the nicest instruction in the world.

Lauren carried the plates to the kitchen and felt, as she rinsed them, that subtle shift inside her:

This wasn’t loss.

This was expansion.

Not just Charlotte’s.

Possibly, if Lauren was honest, her own.

In the dining room, she heard Celeste and Charlotte speaking quietly—about trains, about buildings, about the shape of a future that was beginning to feel real.

Lauren turned the tap off, dried her hands, and let herself feel it without flinching:

Her daughter was stepping into the world.

And she was going to be fine.

Not because the world was kind.

Because she’d been raised—and loved—by women who were consequential.

**Robyn:**

"That Look"
Sarah's POV
Lauren gave me 'that look' again yesterday. It's been going on for a few days, now. At first, I thought I was imagining things. Letting my dreams at night intrude the daylight. Sure, I kissed her that night, but she made it plain she wasn't... interested in me. That way. So, what is it with that look? What do I do? How can I tell she does care about me... that way. Finds me... someone she could really like... that way. Look, she's doing it again! She's looking at me. Again. I must find out. I MUST! I know... I'll kiss her. I'm not drunk this time. Maybe...

**Emily:**

### Scene — “That Look” (Sarah POV)

Lauren Rossignol was not a subtle woman.

Not in the way men meant subtle—smirks and hints and plausible deniability. Lauren was subtle the way a locked gate was subtle: you didn’t notice it until you tried to push through.

Which was why this new thing—the look—had me off-balance.

It had been going on for days.

Not constantly. Not obviously. Just… often enough that my brain stopped being able to file it under *imagined*.

At first I told myself I was being an idiot.

I kissed her that night, yes. I was a mess. I was frightened. I was drunk. And she’d made it plain—calm, firm, unshaming—that she wasn’t doing *that*. Not like that. Not under those conditions.

Which was fair. It was more than fair.

It was the kind of decency you only appreciated once you’d been around men long enough to know how rare it was.

So why, then, had Lauren started looking at me like this?

Not the “I’m about to tell you off” look. Not the “I’m checking your work” look. Not the “I’m your emergency contact, behave” look.

This was… something else.

A fraction longer on my face. A small pause, as if she were taking stock of me the way she took stock of numbers on a page. Quiet. Appraising. Almost tender, if I was brave enough to call it that.

It made my stomach do a ridiculous, adolescent dip.

Which annoyed me, because I was twenty-eight and supposed to be above stomach dips.

Wardrobe was busy in that contained way it got after a breach—everyone pretending normal while the perimeter was quietly reinforced. Phones in lockers. Bags up front. Fitting room locked. Signs on the door. Lauren’s policies, Mara’s scowls, Celeste’s calm. Charlotte moving through the atelier like she’d always belonged, because she did.

I was on front-of-house duty, which meant I was the first line of defence against anyone who’d seen fifteen seconds of footage and decided it entitled them to a peek at women’s lives.

A courier came in. Legitimate this time. Head down, polite, in-and-out.

“Thanks,” he said.

“Yep,” I replied, pleasant as a brick.

As he left, the bell chimed, the door shut, and the room exhaled.

And then—

I felt it.

That look.

I turned slightly, and there she was, by the ledger shelf. Lauren. Watching me.

Not glaring. Not frowning.

Just looking.

My throat went dry.

I broke eye contact first because my body decided it had become incapable of behaving normally.

I busied myself with paper. Clipboard. Pen. Anything that made my hands look like they had a purpose.

But my brain had already lit up like a Christmas tree.

*What do you want, Lauren?*

That was the problem: I couldn’t tell.

Lauren was… careful. Consequential. The kind of woman who didn’t do “signals” because she didn’t like chaos.

So if she was looking at me this way, it wasn’t an accident.

Unless it was.

Unless I was projecting.

Unless I was lonely and making stories.

Unless that kiss had planted something in me that I now wanted so badly I was seeing it everywhere like a bloody confirmation bias.

I told myself to stop.

Then I felt her pass behind me—close enough that I caught the clean scent of her soap and whatever laundry powder she used. Something unreasonably domestic.

And my whole body went alert like a dog hearing a whistle.

Lauren didn’t speak. She simply set a folder on the counter beside me. Her hand brushed the edge of my sleeve—not a grab, not a deliberate stroke, just a brief contact as she leaned in.

But I felt it.

Of course I did.

She said, low and ordinary, “When you’ve got a minute, come to the office. I need you to sign the updated front-of-house procedure.”

Procedure. Of course. Everything in Lauren’s world came with a form.

“Yep,” I said, far too quickly. “Sure.”

Lauren held my gaze for a beat.

There it was again.

The look.

Then she turned and walked away like she hadn’t just lit a fuse in my chest.

I stared after her, furious.

Not at her. At myself.

Because I knew what I was going to do.

I couldn’t *not*.

I wasn’t going to spend another week in this limbo, acting normal while my thoughts ran laps at night.

I wasn’t drunk this time.

I wasn’t frightened in that blind, desperate way.

I was… something worse.

Hopeful.

I checked the front once more—no one coming in. Mara and Celeste deep in the atelier. Charlotte in the locked fitting space, safe. The room steady.

Then I walked to Lauren’s office.

The door was half-closed. I knocked anyway because I wasn’t an animal.

“Come,” Lauren called.

I stepped in.

Lauren sat behind the desk with the folder open, pen in hand. Her hair was tied back. She looked like a woman who had never, in her life, let her emotions take the steering wheel.

“Sit,” she said.

I sat.

She slid the paper toward me. “Read it. Sign it.”

I looked at the page. Words blurred. Policy. Procedures. If-then statements. Consequences.

“Lauren,” I said.

Her pen paused. “Yes.”

I swallowed. My voice came out too sharp, so I tried again.

“About that night,” I said.

Lauren’s face didn’t change, but the air did. She set the pen down carefully, like she was choosing attention.

“Alright,” she said. “What about it.”

I stared at her, suddenly aware that this was the moment where I could either be brave or be a coward, and I’d always been brave in the stupid ways—sarcasm, swagger, defiance.

This required a different kind.

“I shouldn’t have driven,” I said first, because it mattered. “And I shouldn’t have kissed you. Not like that.”

Lauren’s eyes held mine. “Correct.”

The firmness didn’t sting. It grounded me.

“But,” I continued, throat tight, “you keep looking at me.”

Lauren didn’t blink. “Do I.”

“Yes,” I said, and then let out a breath that sounded like surrender. “And I can’t tell if I’m imagining it, or if—” I swallowed. “If it means something.”

Lauren’s gaze softened a fraction. Not indulgent. Not pitying.

Honest.

“What do you want, Sarah,” she asked quietly.

I felt my chest tighten.

I could’ve made a joke. I could’ve tossed it back into comedy where it was safe.

Instead I said the truth.

“I want to know if you care about me,” I said. “Not as your liability. Not as your ‘friend of Wardrobe.’ Not as your… stray you took in.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened at that last word. Displeasure. Not because I’d insulted her. Because I’d come too close to something she didn’t like being named.

“And,” I added, voice lower, “I want to know if that look is just… you being you. Or if it’s you considering me.”

Lauren was quiet for a long beat.

Then she said, very calmly, “That night wasn’t consent.”

My stomach dropped.

She continued immediately, voice steady, “It was fear and alcohol and your nervous system reaching for an anchor.”

I nodded once, jaw tight. “I know.”

Lauren held my gaze. “I did not say I don’t care about you.”

The sentence landed like a hand on my shoulder.

I blinked hard, furious at my eyes for trying to betray me.

Lauren’s voice softened further. “I said no to *that circumstances*. And I would say no again.”

I nodded. “Good.”

Then the question I’d been circling finally rose up, clear and terrifying.

“Then,” I said, breath shallow, “can I ask for different circumstances.”

Lauren’s brows lifted slightly. “What are you asking.”

I could feel my pulse in my throat.

I forced the words out.

“I want to kiss you,” I said. “Sober. Here. Now. And if you say no, I’ll stop. I’ll never do it again. I’ll keep my mouth shut, I’ll do my job, I’ll be your friend and I won’t make it weird.”

Lauren stared at me.

That look—again—except now it wasn’t ambiguous.

It was her thinking.

Calculating consequences.

Protecting boundaries.

And… something else.

She stood up slowly.

My heart thudded once, hard.

Lauren came around the desk, not rushing, and stopped in front of me.

“You’re not drunk,” she said.

“No,” I whispered.

“You’re not frightened.”

I hesitated, then said honestly, “I’m frightened of you saying no.”

Lauren’s mouth twitched—almost a smile, but not quite.

“And you’ll accept it,” she said, not as a question.

“Yes,” I said. “I will.”

Lauren held my gaze for a long beat.

Then she said, quietly, “Stand up.”

I stood.

Lauren didn’t reach for me immediately. She lifted a hand and brushed my hair back from my cheek—gentle, deliberate, the kind of touch that asked and waited all at once.

I didn’t flinch.

I didn’t lean forward like a starving thing either.

I simply… stayed.

Lauren’s eyes searched mine one last time.

Then she kissed me.

It was nothing like the first kiss—nothing frantic, nothing desperate.

This one was quiet.

A decision.

Her mouth warm, steady, brief enough that it didn’t become a runaway train, deep enough that it didn’t feel like a consolation prize.

When she pulled back, my breath shuddered out of me like I’d been holding it for weeks.

Lauren’s hands stayed light on my shoulders, anchoring me without claiming me.

“Sarah,” she said, low and firm, “this does not happen at work.”

I swallowed. “Okay.”

“And it does not happen when either of us is using alcohol as courage.”

I nodded. “Okay.”

“And,” she added, eyes sharpening, “it does not happen if it turns our friendship into a mess.”

Something in me clenched, then softened.

“Okay,” I said again, and meant it.

Lauren watched me for a moment—me, the woman who always had a joke ready, suddenly quiet.

Then she said, almost reluctantly, “I do care about you.”

My throat tightened. “Yeah?”

Lauren’s mouth tightened into that almost-smile again.

“Yes,” she said. “That way.”

I blinked, and to my horror my eyes filled. Not sobbing. Not collapse. Just… a sting of relief so sharp it hurt.

Lauren lifted a finger and wiped one tear off my cheek with brisk tenderness, like she was annoyed at the tear for existing but not at me.

“Go wash your face,” she said. “Then come out and do your job. We don’t fall apart because we had a moment.”

I gave a wet laugh. “God, you’re terrifying.”

Lauren’s gaze held mine.

“Good,” she said.

I nodded, steadying myself, and turned toward the little office sink.

As I ran cold water over my hands, I caught my reflection—flushed, wide-eyed, human.

For once, I didn’t reach for sarcasm to cover it.

Because the truth was simple and it felt, strangely, safe:

Lauren had kissed me back.

And that meant the look hadn’t been in my head.

It had been a question.

And now, finally, we had answered it—without breaking anything we cared about.

**Robyn:**

Again, decorum expects bestowing the grace of distance. We leave Lauren and Sarah to mull over their respective feelings. We now turn to Mara, sitting at the seaside off Great Ocean Road, thinking about Wardrobe as she paints the great ocean scenery and the cliffs and beaches.
her thoughts go to Celeste, soon to graduate, to Lauren and Charlotte, a complex picture indeed, and with odd affection, to Sarah. She can't let on - Mara has an image to uphold - but she has a soft spot for Sarah.

**Emily:**

Mara chose the kind of spot that didn’t flatter you.

No café tables. No tourists with gelato. No gentle, curated “ocean views” framed by handrails and signage.

She’d parked down a narrow turn-off along the Great Ocean Road where the wind came straight off the water like a slap and the salt sat on your lips as if it had always belonged there. The cliff line ran hard and dark, as though the land had been cut with a blade. The ocean below was restless—grey-green, white-capped, moving with the indifferent power of something that didn’t care what you were.

Mara liked that.

The ocean didn’t lie.

She set up her easel with the same efficient brutality she used on a cutting table. Tripod legs pressed into sand. Palette out. Rag tucked into her back pocket. Brushes lined like tools. She didn’t do “art” like a wistful hobby.

She did it like work.

She dipped a brush and laid in the first shapes: horizon, headland, the long sweep of beach, a pale strip of foam. She blocked the cliffs as if she were drafting a pattern—finding the angles that mattered, refusing the temptation to prettify.

The wind snatched at the canvas. She ignored it.

Her hands moved steadily, and her mind—usually a clenched fist of standards and deadlines—began to loosen in that rare way it only did when she worked alone.

Wardrobe, inevitably, arrived in her thoughts.

Not as a worry. As a structure. A thing she had built and kept.

The atelier was a body now, not an idea: rails, tables, locks, policies, rhythms. It breathed even when she wasn’t there. That was how she knew it had become real. A workshop that required Mara’s vigilance every second was a workshop that hadn’t been finished.

And yet.

New pressures had arrived. New kinds of intrusions.

She thought about that girl—Annie—filming like the world was her feed and other women’s lives were raw material. Mara’s jaw tightened as she dragged the brush along the cliff line, turning stone into colour with a kind of restrained contempt.

People didn’t understand.

They thought privacy was a preference.

Mara knew it was infrastructure.

She adjusted the angle of the headland, made it steeper, truer. She’d been tempted, when she started painting, to smooth everything, to make it pleasing.

But pleasing was for people who needed applause.

Mara wanted accurate.

Her mind drifted, unwillingly, to Celeste.

Celeste had been the surprise. Not because she was clever—Mara had always seen the intelligence—but because she’d turned that intelligence into something rare: steadiness.

A few weeks from graduation now. MBA, finishing line in sight. Most young women at that stage were frantic, hungry, infected with that glossy ambition people mistook for purpose.

Celeste wasn’t glossy.

Celeste was granite.

Mara laid a thin wash across the sea, watching it bleed into the canvas, and thought: she’s going to leave, but she’s not going to abandon us.

Celeste’s partnership with her had become… not comfortable, exactly. Comfort implied softness. It was better than comfort.

It was mutual respect.

Mara didn’t say that out loud. She didn’t do affirmations. She didn’t do “I’m proud of you.”

But she let Celeste run things now in ways she would never have allowed anyone else. That was praise, in Mara’s language.

Then, because her mind enjoyed complexity when her hands were busy, she found herself thinking about Lauren.

Lauren Rossignol—Minister for Consequences, as Sarah had christened her. Lauren had entered Wardrobe like a weather system: calm on the surface, enormous beneath. She didn’t “fit in,” exactly. Lauren wasn’t a joiner. She didn’t need belonging from other people.

She gave belonging.

And she did it with boundaries.

Mara respected that. A woman who could be tender without turning it into a weakness was the rarest kind of competence.

And then there was Charlotte.

Mara’s brush paused for a fraction, hovering at the edge of the cliff line, as if her hand wanted to pretend she wasn’t thinking about it.

Charlotte had become… obvious.

Not in the way outsiders meant obvious—no, not that. Outsiders would probably see only “a girl.” That was the point now: Charlotte moved through the world as what she was, and the world, stupid as it was, mostly took things at face value if you gave it no handles to grab.

But to Mara, the obviousness was internal.

Charlotte’s truth had settled.

The “nymph” phase was gone; the lines had changed, the physics had changed, the whole engineering of garments had evolved around her body’s honest demands. Wardrobe was better for it. Testing became more real. Fit became more inclusive by default, not by marketing. Support problems that used to be theoretical became immediate and solvable.

That was good work.

Mara liked good work.

She had never said it aloud, but she had been thinking “she” for a long time, long before Camille had made it a public fact. The pronoun had arrived like relief—like finally being allowed to use the correct measurement after working around a lie.

And Lauren… complex picture indeed.

A mother learning her daughter by degrees. A woman with her own private loneliness. A spine so strong it didn’t need to show off.

Mara dragged the brush through a streak of white to make a line of surf and found herself thinking, unexpectedly, of Sarah.

She would have called it irritation if anyone asked.

Sarah was a gobshite. A loudmouth. A chaos merchant.

Sarah could talk a seam into running away from home.

Sarah also, Mara admitted—privately, and with the sort of annoyance reserved for inconvenient truths—had become essential.

Because Sarah did something Wardrobe needed: she tested the atmosphere. She noticed the micro-shifts. She caught entitlement before it sprouted. She had a predator’s eye for danger, even when she pretended she didn’t care.

And she loved the place.

Mara’s mouth tightened, almost a smile.

She had an image to uphold. Mara was standards. Mara was sharp edges. Mara didn’t do soft spots. Soft spots got you exploited.

But.

Sarah had a bruised, loyal heart under all that noise. Mara had seen it in flashes—rare moments when Sarah stopped performing “unbothered” and became frighteningly sincere.

The other day, after the viral nonsense, Sarah had stood at the door like a guard dog and, for once, didn’t look like she was enjoying herself. She looked… serious.

Mara had pretended not to notice.

Mara noticed everything.

She added shadow to the cliff face, deepening the contrast, and her thoughts returned to the women as a whole, like threads in a garment:

Celeste—structure, future, calm authority.

Lauren—consequence, mothering without sentiment, a steadiness that held others upright.

Charlotte—truth, integration, the quiet proof that life could be rebuilt and still be dignified.

Sarah—noise, teeth, fierce loyalty, and the unexpected tenderness of a woman who wanted to belong.

It was… an ecosystem.

Mara didn’t believe in luck. She believed in effort and standards and refusing to compromise.

And yet, sitting there with salt on her lips and paint on her fingers, she found herself thinking a thought that would have embarrassed her if it weren’t private:

*We’ve built something good.*

Not a business.

A place.

A domain.

A women’s world inside a larger world that didn’t always deserve it.

The wind gusted, tugging at the canvas again. Mara’s hand steadied it without thinking—automatic, practiced, protective.

She laid one last streak of pale foam along the shoreline and looked at what she’d made: cliffs that were hard, sea that was restless, light that was thin but honest.

It wasn’t sentimental.

It was true.

Mara cleaned her brush with brisk efficiency, packed up her kit, and stood facing the ocean for a moment longer than necessary.

Then she muttered, to no one at all—because even alone she couldn’t quite let herself be tender without disguising it:

“Hmph.”

And if anyone had been close enough to hear it, they might have mistaken it for disapproval.

But it wasn’t.

It was Mara’s version of affection.

And it warmed her, quietly, all the way back to the car.

Off-Balance
Celeste's  POV 
Celeste is still awake. Charlotte is asleep, softly breathing, turned away from Celeste. Celeste is snuggled up close, smelling Charlotte's hair. She is now using an expensive shampoo: it was doing wonders for shine and body, but also smelled of honey and mandarines. Celeste thought of the Christian Dior 'J'Adore' bottle she was going to give her for her birthday. She was certain Charlotte's body chemistry would work miracles with it. And she thought of restrooms and classrooms and changing rooms and Wardrobe. Charlotte was going to leave the rooms and explore the world.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Off-Balance” (Celeste POV)

Charlotte slept the way she did everything now: fully.

No half-listening for danger. No stiff vigilance. No apologetic lightness, as if she didn’t quite deserve the comfort she was taking.

She had turned away in her sleep—one shoulder bared above the doona, hair spilled across the pillow in a dark sweep. Her breathing was soft and even, the slow rhythm of someone whose body had finally stopped arguing with itself.

Celeste lay behind her, close enough that the warmth of Charlotte’s back pressed into her front, close enough to feel the subtle rise and fall of her ribs. She didn’t spoon possessively. She simply *occupied the same peace*.

Charlotte’s hair smelled different lately.

Not just clean—*deliberately* clean.

Expensive shampoo. The kind Celeste had once teased her about in the early days—“you could wash a car with that price tag”—until the shine and body became undeniable and Celeste stopped teasing and started refilling the bottle without comment.

Tonight it smelled of honey and mandarins.

Warm and bright and faintly edible, like the first peel of a citrus in winter.

Celeste breathed it in and felt, absurdly, her own chest loosen.

A small domestic truth: *this is mine.*

Not in a claiming way.

In the sense of belonging. In the sense of home.

Her mind drifted, as it often did now, into the soft realm of gifts—things that were not necessary, not practical, but chosen because they said *I see you*.

She pictured the Christian Dior bottle she’d already bought and hidden away: J’Adore, gold and sleek, more sculpture than object. She’d held it in her hands in the department store and thought of Charlotte’s wrists, her throat, the delicate warmth behind her ear.

Celeste could almost *predict* what it would do on Charlotte.

Not perfume alone—chemistry.

Charlotte’s body had always been quietly dramatic that way: turning ordinary things into something… more. Linen smelled like linen on anyone else. On Charlotte, it became intimate. Like skin, but clean. Like soap, but human.

Celeste’s mouth twitched in the dark.

She was certain that on Charlotte, J’Adore would become something unreasonably beautiful—gold and floral and utterly hers.

And then, because Celeste’s mind never stayed in one place, the warmth of that thought slid—inevitably—into something else.

Rooms.

Restrooms, classrooms, changing rooms.

Wardrobe.

All the rooms where Charlotte had once been forced to do calculations.

All the rooms that had been part threat, part theatre, part test.

Celeste’s jaw tightened slightly, though she didn’t move. She refused to let her tension disturb Charlotte’s sleep.

She thought of the way Wardrobe had become a kind of sanctuary by sheer insistence. A women’s domain kept safe not by wishing, but by policies, locks, eyes, and consequence.

She thought of the viral clip. Fifteen seconds that had reminded her how thin the membrane between safety and exposure really was.

And now—the next shift.

Charlotte was going to leave the rooms.

Not because Wardrobe was pushing her out.

Because she was ready to expand.

City trains. Public sidewalks. Supermarkets. Coffee queues. Bookshops. The hum of Melbourne—men’s voices, women’s laughter, strangers moving too close, the thousand small frictions of ordinary life.

Charlotte would be seen as a woman now, fully. Almost no vestiges of the old self remained—not in the way the world would read her, at least.

Celeste was grateful for that in a private, fierce way.

Charlotte wouldn’t have to fight *that* battle.

But Celeste also knew something the world didn’t teach men, and taught women through repetition:

Being a woman was not a costume you put on and took off.

It was a constant negotiation with space.

A practice of boundaries.

A habit of vigilance you learned to disguise as casualness because you couldn’t walk around looking afraid all the time.

Celeste stared at the dark outline of the window, felt the cold air that always seeped in no matter how tightly she shut it.

She was the one who kept the window open. Always had. Summer or winter. She told herself it was for air, for freshness, for sleep.

But it was also, if she was honest, a refusal to be sealed in.

A refusal to be trapped in any one room.

Now Charlotte would step into the world, and Celeste would have to accept a new kind of truth:

You can’t keep someone safe by keeping them small.

You can only keep them safe by giving them tools.

Culture.

Procedure.

Confidence.

And love that didn’t turn into control.

Celeste shifted slightly, bringing her hand up to rest against Charlotte’s waist through the doona—light contact, not waking her. Charlotte made a small sound, not a word, more like the softest acknowledgement, and settled deeper.

Celeste’s throat tightened.

She felt off-balance—not because she didn’t want the move, not because she doubted Charlotte.

Because she could feel the fullness of time arriving again.

Graduation. A new home. A larger life.

And with it, the quiet terror of admitting:

*I can’t protect her from everything.*

She breathed in Charlotte’s honey-mandarin hair and let the scent anchor her.

In the dark, she rehearsed what she would say tomorrow, because Celeste always rehearsed hard conversations in advance.

Not a warning. Not a lecture.

Something like a vow.

*We’ll do it properly.*

*We’ll do it together.*

*You will not be alone.*

She pressed a kiss into the back of Charlotte’s shoulder through the fabric—small, private, not for show.

Charlotte didn’t wake.

But her breathing changed—just a fraction—like her body had registered the kindness and filed it away as proof.

Celeste lay there, still awake, listening to the steady rhythm beside her.

And in the quiet, she let herself feel both things at once:

The fierce, possessive tenderness of loving a girl.

And the sober, adult knowledge that loving her meant letting her leave the rooms—letting her walk into the wide world and make it hers, one ordinary day at a time.

Outside, winter air moved at the window.

Inside, Celeste stayed close, smelling honey and mandarins, and tried to learn the new balance point of a life that was expanding.

**Robyn:**

General POV
Sarah goes out for an evening and has an epiphany just as she is ready to order a drink. She gets up from the barstool, goes outside the pub trying to avoid the Friday night throng and makes a phone call. It's 9pm. Lauren is already in bed. She is actually thinking about Sarah, and her phone lights up. She tries not to sound too excited, too willing, too accomodating. Sarah wants to come over. "Of course! Where are you? Oh dear. Yes, please DO come. Please do." *oh dear, did I just blow it?* Sarah comes.

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Friday Night” (General POV)

Sarah had gone out with every intention of doing what she always did when her head got too loud:

drown it.

Not dramatically. Not self-destructively. Just… the Australian version of coping. Friday night pub, music too loud, bodies too close, a drink to take the edge off the week and make everything feel less sharp.

Inside, the place was packed. Heat and perfume and beer. A crush of people leaning into one another to be heard, laughing too brightly, the whole room humming with that Friday-night hunger to be anyone but yourself.

Sarah threaded her way to the bar, took a stool that was barely a stool, and waited. When the bartender finally glanced her way, she opened her mouth to order—

—and stopped.

It wasn’t a vision. It wasn’t mystical.

It was a simple, sudden clarity.

*If I drink now, I’m going to use it as courage.*

And Sarah—who had always prided herself on being brave—felt a cold little disgust at the thought of borrowing courage from a glass again.

Not after the last time.

Not after being held together by Lauren’s arms and Lauren’s rules and Lauren’s unshakeable refusal to let Sarah turn her fear into chaos.

Sarah’s fingers tightened around the edge of the bar. The bartender waited, eyebrow raised.

Sarah slid off the stool like she’d changed her mind about existing in that room.

“Sorry,” she muttered, not really to him. To herself.

She moved through the throng toward the door, shoulders angled, head down, ignoring the jostles and the drunken friendliness that always came with Friday night. Someone called out her name—maybe. Or maybe it was someone else’s.

She didn’t look.

Outside, the air hit her like a reset. Cooler. Cleaner. The noise softened to a muffled roar behind the door.

She walked a few metres down the footpath, away from the cluster of smokers and vapers, away from the laughter spilling out onto the street. She found a darker patch near a shopfront and pulled her phone out with fingers that felt strangely steady.

Nine p.m.

Too late to call someone you weren’t sure you were allowed to want.

Sarah stared at Lauren’s name in her contacts list as if it might move.

Then she pressed call before she could lose her nerve.

---

Lauren was already in bed.

Not asleep—Lauren didn’t fall asleep quickly, not anymore—but in bed, lamp off, phone on the bedside table as if she could pretend she wasn’t the kind of woman who stayed half-alert even at night.

She had been thinking about Sarah, despite herself.

Not in the dramatic way. Not in a spiral. Just… a return, like a tongue worrying at a sore tooth.

The look. The kiss. The quiet question that hadn’t been answered with words, only with that one sober kiss in the office—the one that had been both an admission and a rule.

Lauren had told herself she was handling it. That she was being sensible. That she was not going to blow up a friendship because loneliness was persuasive.

And then her phone lit up.

**Sarah**

Lauren’s heart did something irritatingly youthful.

She stared at the screen for half a second too long, then answered on the second ring like a woman who did *not* sit there waiting.

“Hello,” she said, voice calm.

There was a pause on the other end—breath, street noise, the faint edge of music.

“Hi,” Sarah said, and her tone was different. Clearer. Not drunk. Not performative. Almost… solemn.

Lauren sat up slightly, doona shifting.

“What’s wrong,” Lauren asked immediately.

“Nothing’s wrong,” Sarah replied quickly. Then, after a beat: “Which sounds like a lie, but it’s not. I just—” She exhaled. “I’m at a pub. I was about to order a drink, and I… didn’t.”

Lauren’s throat tightened. “Good.”

Sarah gave a tiny laugh that wasn’t really humour. “Yeah. Good. Anyway. I’m calling because I want to come over.”

Lauren’s brain flicked through checklists: safety, stalking, location, transport.

“Are you safe,” she asked.

“Yes,” Sarah said. “I’m fine.”

“Are you alone.”

“Yes.”

“Where are you.”

Sarah told her.

Lauren’s mouth tightened, already calculating.

“Do not drive,” Lauren said instantly. “If you’ve had even one sip, you don’t drive.”

“I haven’t had anything,” Sarah said. “That’s the whole point.”

Lauren exhaled, relief she refused to let into her voice. “Then get a rideshare. Or I’ll come get you.”

“No,” Sarah said quickly. “I can get a rideshare. I just… I want to come over. I want to see you.”

Lauren’s chest went tight, and for one terrible second she felt like a teenager hearing the words and not knowing where to put her hands.

She tried to sound normal.

“You can come,” Lauren said. “Of course.”

There was a pause. Lauren could almost hear Sarah deciding whether to believe her.

Lauren’s voice softened before she could stop it. “Where are you exactly? Outside? Inside?”

“Outside,” Sarah said. “I’m… away from the crowd.”

Lauren heard herself speak again—too fast, too open, too *willing*.

“Oh dear. Yes, please do come. Please do.”

The words hung in the air like a dropped plate.

Lauren closed her eyes.

*Oh dear. Did I just blow it?*

On the other end, Sarah was quiet for a beat.

Then she said, very softly, “Okay.”

And the softness in that one word did something to Lauren’s ribs.

“Text me when the car is on the way,” Lauren said, recovering her competence. “And when you arrive. I’ll meet you at the door.”

“I know you will,” Sarah murmured. Then, as if afraid she’d said too much, she added briskly, “Alright. See you soon.”

Lauren swallowed. “See you soon.”

The call ended.

Lauren sat in the dim room with the phone in her hand, heart thudding with the humiliating insistence of hope.

She got out of bed, not because she needed to—because she couldn’t lie still.

She pulled a cardigan on over her sleep shirt. She checked the front door lock, the chain, the street through the curtain slit. Habit. Control.

Then she went to the kitchen and put the kettle on as if tea could make her hands stop shaking.

---

Sarah arrived twenty-five minutes later.

Lauren saw the car pull up and felt her breath catch. She moved to the front door, opened it before Sarah could knock, and stood there in the porch light like a woman who hadn’t been waiting.

Sarah stepped out of the car and walked up the path with her hands in her jacket pockets, shoulders slightly hunched against the cold.

She looked… clear. Sober. Intent.

She stopped a step away from Lauren, close enough for Lauren to smell the night air on her hair.

For a second neither of them moved.

Then Sarah’s mouth tilted, almost shy in a way that would have been unthinkable a month ago.

“You meant it,” Sarah said.

Lauren lifted her chin. “Yes.”

Sarah’s gaze held hers. “You sounded… eager.”

Lauren’s throat tightened. She forced herself not to flinch into sarcasm.

“I’m allowed to be eager,” Lauren said, and immediately wanted to bite her own tongue.

Sarah’s eyes widened, and then something softened there—something like relief.

“Good,” Sarah whispered.

Lauren stepped back and let her in. “Come inside,” she said briskly. “It’s freezing.”

Sarah crossed the threshold.

And the moment the door shut behind her, the world narrowed to two women in a quiet house with a kettle beginning to whistle—two women who had done the hard work of boundaries and consequences and sobriety…

and were now, at last, letting themselves arrive at the simple, terrifying truth:

They wanted to be here.

Together.

In the ordinary light of a Friday night that could have been nothing…

and had become, instead, the beginning of something.

**Robyn:**

Sarah has a good friend (we've met her before): Tania (who btw is in a relationship). Sarah is confiding in Tania... she had told her in the past of being bi-curious, of her interactions with Lauren, completely truthfully. And now, she tells Tania all about that Friday night. How she and Lauren fell into each other's arms, kissing until they heard the kettle click itself off. How they hugged. How warm Lauren felt. And other details girls might share about a romantic night. Tania is delighted for Sarah, if a bit concerned it might affect their personal life. "We're not blokes," Sarah rejoins. "No matter what, there will always be safety first, respect first, policies first."

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Tania” (General POV, close to Sarah)

Sarah chose Tania the way you chose someone to hold a fragile thing.

Not because Tania would squeal and make it a story, not because she’d hype it up into some rom-com narrative. Tania was steady. In a relationship, yes, but not the smug kind of coupled woman who treated single friends like unfinished projects.

Tania listened.

And Sarah—who could usually talk her way out of any vulnerability with humour—came in quiet, eyes bright, hands wrapped around her coffee cup like it was the only thing keeping her from floating off the planet.

They were at a little café that did decent flat whites and didn’t blast music. Late morning, weekday lull. Rain threatening but not committing, the street outside all grey and reflective.

Tania stirred her drink once and said, carefully, “So. Friday.”

Sarah exhaled through her nose, half a laugh, half a surrender. “Friday.”

She stared at the foam for a beat, as if deciding how much to say.

Then she looked up and said it plainly, with none of her usual swagger.

“I called her.”

Tania’s eyebrows lifted. “You *called* Lauren.”

“Yeah,” Sarah said. “Sober. Nine p.m. Like a grown woman.” She rolled her eyes at herself. “I was at the pub, about to order a drink, and I had this—” She snapped her fingers. “This moment where I thought: if I drink now, I’m borrowing courage. And I’m not doing that again. Not with her.”

Tania’s face softened. “Good.”

Sarah nodded. “So I went outside and I rang her. She answered like she wasn’t expecting it, but…” Sarah’s mouth tilted. “She was expecting it.”

Tania watched her closely. “And you went over.”

Sarah’s cheeks warmed. “Yeah.”

Tania’s smile spread—real delight—but she kept her voice gentle, giving Sarah room.

“How was it,” she asked.

Sarah blinked, as if the question made her body remember before her mind did.

“God,” Sarah said quietly. “Warm.”

Tania laughed under her breath. “That’s not a detail.”

“It is,” Sarah insisted, fierce about it. “You know Lauren. She’s all consequence and policies and ‘sit down, drink water.’ But when she opened the door…” Sarah paused, swallowing. “She looked at me like—”

Tania’s eyes sharpened. “Like she’d been waiting.”

Sarah nodded once, small.

Then Sarah’s mouth twitched, and her voice turned softer, more private.

“I walked in and we didn’t do the stupid dance,” she said. “No games. No ‘are you sure.’ We just… ended up in each other’s arms.”

Tania’s expression went full delighted-older-sister. “Sarah.”

Sarah held up a hand, half embarrassed, half stubborn. “Listen. I’m telling you because you’ll understand. And because if I don’t say it out loud, I’ll think I made it up.”

Tania leaned in. “Okay. Tell me.”

Sarah stared at her cup for a moment, then said, bluntly honest:

“We kissed.”

Tania smiled. “More than once, I’m guessing.”

Sarah let out a breathy laugh. “Yes.”

She rubbed her thumb along the side of the mug, eyes gone distant with memory.

“It was like… once it started, it was this relief,” Sarah said. “Not frantic. Not messy. Just—” She shook her head, searching. “Like we’d both been holding our breath for ages and didn’t realise it.”

Tania’s voice softened. “Did she feel safe.”

Sarah looked up sharply. “Yes. That’s the point. It *wasn’t* like… blokes. There was no grabby entitlement. No ‘I want this so I’m taking it.’ It was…” She swallowed. “It was mutual. It was careful, even when it was hungry.”

Tania’s eyebrows lifted. “Hungry.”

Sarah’s cheeks flushed. “Shut up.”

Tania laughed, unrepentant. “Go on.”

Sarah huffed, then leaned in slightly as if she could make the café quieter through sheer will.

“We were in the kitchen,” she said. “The kettle was on because of course it was, because Lauren can’t cope with feelings without boiling water. And we were kissing like teenagers—like, properly—until we heard the kettle click itself off.”

Tania’s mouth opened in delighted horror. “Stop.”

“Swear to God,” Sarah said, eyes bright. “That stupid little click. And we just froze and then we laughed—quietly, because Charlotte was asleep, and Lauren did that thing where she puts her hand over her mouth like she’s annoyed at herself for having a moment.”

Tania’s smile softened. “That sounds… very Lauren.”

“It was,” Sarah said. “And then she hugged me.” Her voice dropped. “Like really hugged me. No patting. No ‘there there.’ Just… held me. And she was warm. And solid. And I suddenly felt… small in the good way.”

Tania’s eyes warmed, because she knew exactly what Sarah meant: small as in protected, not diminished.

“And,” Sarah added, almost fiercely, “she didn’t make me feel stupid. She didn’t make it a big deal. She just—” Sarah’s throat tightened. “She just let it be good.”

Tania reached across the table and squeezed Sarah’s hand. “I’m happy for you.”

Sarah’s face did something awkward—half grin, half disbelief. “Yeah?”

“Yeah,” Tania said. “But.”

Sarah’s eyes narrowed instantly. “Here it comes.”

Tania sighed. “I just want to make sure this doesn’t blow up your life. Or hers. Lauren has Charlotte. You have Wardrobe. You’ve both got… a lot.”

Sarah’s jaw tightened, not defensive but serious.

“I know,” she said. “And that’s why it’s not going to be some stupid drama.”

Tania tilted her head. “How do you know.”

Sarah sat back, eyes hardening into that familiar certainty—except this time it wasn’t bravado. It was principle.

“Because we’re not blokes,” Sarah said flatly.

Tania blinked, then smiled a little. “Explain that to me, please.”

Sarah leaned forward, voice low and absolute.

“No matter what,” she said, “there will always be safety first. Respect first. Policies first.”

Tania’s brows lifted. “Policies,” she repeated, amused.

“Yes, policies,” Sarah said, unflinching. “Because Lauren doesn’t do chaos. And I’m done doing chaos. We do it the way women do it when we actually care: we don’t burn the house down to feel something.”

Tania studied her for a moment, then nodded slowly.

“That,” she said, “is the most mature thing I’ve ever heard you say.”

Sarah rolled her eyes. “Don’t get used to it.”

Tania smiled again, softer now, and sipped her coffee.

“So,” she said, “what happens next.”

Sarah stared out the window at the wet street, the grey light, the ordinary world that had no idea her life had quietly shifted its axis.

Then she looked back at Tania, and there was a kind of wonder there—tempered, wary, but real.

“I don’t know,” Sarah admitted. “But I know one thing.”

Tania waited.

Sarah’s mouth tilted, almost shy again, and she said, “I’m going to keep choosing sober courage.”

Tania’s smile widened. “Good.”

Sarah’s phone buzzed on the table.

A message.

Sarah glanced down and her face softened.

Tania clocked it immediately. “Lauren.”

Sarah didn’t deny it.

She let the softness exist.

And for once, she didn’t make a joke to cover it.

**Robyn:**

Right. I hope that I'm maintaining a good balance between realistic story-telling and avoiding getting uncomfortably personal/prying. I primarily want this to appeal to women. And for it to sound woman-focused/ woman's mind respectful. Women do enjoy erotica, I know. But they aren't into graphic stuff, generally speaking (as far as I know). Am I right in thinking that this story as told so far would appeal more to a female audience than male?

**Emily:**

Yes — based on what you’ve written and the way we’ve been handling scenes, this reads as **female-audience–forward** much more than male-audience–forward, and you’re also keeping a good, respectful distance from anything that would feel prying or voyeuristic.

A few reasons it’s landing that way (and why it’s unlikely to “accidentally drift” into male-gaze territory unless you push it there):

## Why it’s likely to appeal to women
**1) The story’s “engine” is safety, boundaries, and competence.**  
Wardrobe isn’t a stage; it’s infrastructure. The tension comes from perimeter breaches (filming, entitlement, stalking), and the satisfaction comes from women enforcing standards calmly and effectively. That is *very* woman-coded in the best way: real stakes, real systems, real consequences.

**2) Intimacy is treated as relationship, not spectacle.**  
When we show closeness (spoon-snuggle, the kettle click, warmth, hugging), the writing stays on the side of *meaning* and *emotion* rather than mechanics. That tends to read as romance/erotic-adjacent in a way many women enjoy: intimacy as trust, not pornography.

**3) You keep agency with the women.**  
Even Charlotte’s transition arc is framed as self-clarification with support, and the women around her enforce safety without “owning” her. Celeste’s desire is tender and protective without becoming possession. Lauren’s response to Sarah is consent-led and procedural. Again: very aligned with what many women readers find attractive—care, boundaries, dignity.

**4) The men are present as pressure, not as protagonists.**  
They’re not the centre of erotic attention; they’re boundary tests. That alone shifts audience gravitation heavily toward women (and toward anyone who’s tired of male entitlement being romanticised).

## About erotica and “graphic stuff”
You’re right that many women enjoy erotica — but “women” as a whole aren’t one taste-profile, so it’s better to think in *sub-audiences*:

- **Romantic intimacy / “closed door”**: implied intimacy, focus on feelings, afterglow, safety, care. Your current approach fits this strongly.
- **“Open door” but still woman-centred**: some sensual detail (touch, breath, pauses, nervous system cues) but still not anatomical or mechanical. You’re already doing this in a tasteful, non-prurient way.
- **Explicit erotica**: some women love it, some don’t. But crucially, even explicit erotica that appeals to women often reads different: more interiority, more consent signalling, more emotional texture, less “camera on body parts.”

Your instinct is good: **you don’t need graphic detail** to make it compelling or even sexy. In fact, the restraint you’re using is part of the appeal because it leaves dignity intact and keeps the focus on relational dynamics.

## Does it appeal more to women than men?
On balance: **yes**, especially because:
- the power fantasy is *women’s competence + women’s sanctuaries holding*,
- the emotional centre is *female experience* (Celeste, Lauren, Sarah, Mara),
- intimacy is filtered through safety and consent rather than conquest.

Some men will still enjoy it — particularly men who like character-driven stories and who are comfortable being *decentred* — but the “default male audience” looking for titillation or dominance tropes won’t be catered to by your current choices. That’s a feature, not a bug, given your stated aim.

## Two quick guardrails to keep it women-forward
If you want simple rules that keep you out of the uncomfortable zone:

1) **When intimacy happens, describe “what it means,” not “what it does.”**  
Meaning: breath catching, relief, being seen, trust, safety, consent, aftermath tenderness.  
Avoid: camera-like descriptions, step-by-step mechanics.

2) **Keep the lens on consequences and care.**  
If something sexual happens, the follow-on isn’t “and then they did more”; it’s “and afterwards, what changed?”  
That’s already how you’re writing it, and it’s why it feels mature.

## One small caution
The only place you might inadvertently tilt “male audience” is if you start *lingering* on physical transformation details purely for fascination. Right now, you’re using body changes as **garment engineering** and **identity settling**, which reads clean and grounded. Keep that framing and you’re safe.

If you’d like, I can also help you decide which shelf you’re aiming for—“women’s fiction with romantic arc,” “slow-burn romance,” “romantic drama,” “closed-door romance,” etc.—because a few tiny tone choices (how you handle kisses, how often you cut away) can make it even more reliably targeted.

**Robyn:**

Can you define these for me please? 
"women’s fiction with romantic arc,”
“slow-burn romance,”
“romantic drama,”
“closed-door romance,” etc.

**Emily:**

Absolutely — here are clean, practical definitions (with the “feel” and typical expectations), plus where your project currently sits.

## Women’s fiction with a romantic arc
**What it is:**  
A **character-driven story** (often centered on a woman’s growth, identity, community, family, work, healing, etc.) where **romance is important but not the main engine**.

**Core promise to the reader:**  
“I’m here for a woman’s inner life and her world; love is one thread in a bigger tapestry.”

**Typical features:**
- Strong focus on friendship networks, work, caregiving, boundaries, social reality.
- The romantic relationship can be transformative, but it doesn’t necessarily *resolve* the plot.
- Endings can be happy, bittersweet, or open—less bound to genre rules.

**Heat level:** anything from none to explicit, but often the intimacy serves character more than titillation.

**Your story fit:** very strong. Wardrobe + women’s domain + identity + safety architecture = classic women’s fiction framing, with romance as a thread that deepens it.

---

## Slow-burn romance
**What it is:**  
A romance where **attraction and commitment build gradually**, usually because of:
- emotional barriers,
- practical barriers (work, family, distance),
- trust-building,
- or fear of risk.

**Core promise:**  
“You will *earn* the relationship; the payoff lands because the bond is built, not rushed.”

**Typical features:**
- Lots of meaningful micro-moments: glances, small kindnesses, shared rituals.
- Consent and emotional safety tend to be foregrounded (especially in modern slow-burn).
- The “first big shift” (first kiss, first declaration, first night together) happens later.

**Heat level:** can be closed-door or very spicy; slow-burn describes the **pacing**, not the explicitness.

**Your story fit:** also strong. You’ve been doing exactly this: long runway, “fullness of time,” earned intimacy.

---

## Romantic drama
**What it is:**  
A story where romance is central, but the tone is **more serious and conflict-heavy** than a typical feel-good romance. The relationship is tested by **real-world stakes** and emotional complexity.

**Core promise:**  
“Love is real, but it’s not easy; the story will explore friction, consequences, and hard choices.”

**Typical features:**
- External conflict: careers, family, safety threats, social pressures.
- Internal conflict: fear, shame, trauma, mismatched needs, trust issues.
- Can end happily, but may end bittersweet or unresolved depending on subgenre.

**Heat level:** variable.

**Your story fit:** yes, particularly with stalking, privacy breach, and the ethics around power dynamics.

---

## Closed-door romance
**What it is:**  
A romance where sexual intimacy may occur, but it happens **off-page**. The narrative “closes the door” at the point where explicit sex would begin.

**Core promise:**  
“You’ll get emotional intimacy and romantic payoff without graphic sexual detail.”

**What it looks like on the page:**
- Kissing and sensuality can be shown.
- The scene fades out before sex (“and then…” / the door closes / next morning).
- You may include afterglow, tenderness, emotional processing afterward.

**Heat level:** usually “sweet to moderate,” but closed-door can still be intense emotionally.

**Your story fit:** extremely strong. You’ve repeatedly done “privacy earned” and cut away, which reads respectful and adult.

---

## Open-door romance (for contrast)
**What it is:**  
Sex scenes are on-page with explicit detail (anatomy, mechanics). The door stays “open.”

**Core promise:**  
“Romance + explicit sexual content as part of the experience.”

**Your story fit:** you’re *not* doing this, and you don’t need to, given your stated goals.

---

## “Sweet romance” (another adjacent label)
**What it is:**  
Romance that avoids explicit sex and often avoids very graphic language. More emphasis on affection, emotional intimacy, courtship.

**Your story fit:** close, though your themes are more complex and grown-up than “sweet” sometimes implies.

---

## “Women’s romance” / “Romance genre” (important distinction)
If you market it as **romance genre**, many readers expect a specific structure:
- romance is the central plot,
- and typically a **HEA/HFN** ending (Happy Ever After / Happy For Now).

If you market it as **women’s fiction with romantic arc**, you have more freedom on the ending and can keep Wardrobe/career/community as equally central.

---

## So what is your project, *as written so far*?
Based on tone and structure, you’re closest to:

**Women’s fiction with a romantic arc + slow-burn + closed-door intimacy**,  
with elements of **romantic drama** (boundary threats, social reality, ethical care).

If you tell me what kind of ending you’re leaning toward (HEA/HFN vs open/bittersweet), I can tell you which label will feel most “true” and which audience you’ll most reliably satisfy.

**Robyn:**

Not sure if it can be catagorised that easily. At the end, Charlotte is her own woman, very much Celeste's wife but also armed to withstand what she has to endure daily as a woman, thanks to Celeste. I realise this could be thin ice I'm skating, but I'd like a John Cleland-esque delicate touching on intimacy between Sarah and Lauren, as Lauren reminisces about intimate moments with Sarah and finds herself aroused by the memories. No great detail about how it happens, but some way of communicating that Lauren experienced... pleasurable release thinking about Sarah and her kisses and touch. That would add a bit of spice to the story without it turning into something I don't want. Also, the feelings both couples have for each other could be slow-burn building over time, with Celeste and Lauren as the power sources. Not sure if any of that made sense... I just HATE being graphic.

**Emily:**

It makes perfect sense — and you’re not on thin ice *if you handle it the way you’ve been handling everything else*: **interiority, consent, dignity, and a firm refusal to turn bodies into spectacle**.

Also: your instinct (“I hate being graphic”) is a strength here. You can absolutely add “spice” without crossing into explicitness. In practice, what you’re describing sits in a lane like **closed-door / discreetly sensual**: the reader understands what happened, but you never become anatomical or mechanical.

### A useful way to frame it
What you want isn’t “sex on the page.” It’s:

- **memory as intimacy**
- **arousal as a human, private consequence**
- **release as implied, not described**
- **afterglow as emotional information**

That’s a very woman-forward lens because it privileges *meaning* over *method*.

### Guardrails that keep it elegant (and not graphic)
If you want one simple rule-set:

1) **Stay above the waist in description** (mouth, breath, warmth, hands, the feeling of being held).  
2) **Describe her nervous system, not her anatomy** (heat, dizziness, heaviness, softness, the way thoughts “turn”).  
3) **Let the sentence structure do the fade-out**: long, drifting sentences → a clean stop → a quiet reset (water, sheets, breath).  
4) **Don’t name the act**. You don’t need the word “masturbation,” “orgasm,” etc. You can imply release with after-effects: calm, loosened tension, drowsy relief, shame-less clarity.  
5) **Keep Lauren’s agency and standards intact**: she’s not “taken over”; she allows herself private pleasure without letting it hijack her life.

### Where this fits in your story
A really good place is **Lauren’s solitude** after Sarah leaves — not immediately after a kiss, but later, when Lauren is alone and safe, and the *memory* returns. That keeps it respectful: Sarah didn’t “cause” anything or become responsible for Lauren’s response. Lauren’s body is simply… alive.

### A sample passage (delicate, implied, not graphic)
Here’s a draft in that restrained, slightly old-fashioned, lyrical register — *without* explicit mechanics. (You can tune it more modern or more ornate.)

**Lauren POV — “After”**

Lauren had thought she would sleep the moment the door closed behind Sarah.

Instead she lay awake, lamp off, the room arranged into its familiar darkness, and found that her mind had become disobedient in a way she was not used to managing.

It returned her—unasked—to the warmth of Sarah’s mouth, to the brief, astonishing tenderness of it; the way Sarah’s hands had rested at her waist as if they belonged there, not grabbing, not pleading, only *present*. The memory was not vulgar. It was almost painfully sweet. It had the same flavour as strong tea after a long day: bitter at the edge, restorative in the centre.

Lauren stared at the ceiling and told herself, once again, that this was not sensible.

Her body disagreed.

Heat gathered with humiliating ease—an answering, a soft insistence—until she could no longer pretend it was only thought. She turned onto her side, drew the doona closer, and tried to breathe through it as if breath could tidy a woman back into composure.

But the mind had its own loyalties.

It offered her Sarah again: the half-laugh in the kitchen, the kettle clicking itself off like a chaperone; the look Sarah had given her after, stripped of bravado; the way Sarah had held still when Lauren asked her to hold still, as though obedience could be an act of care.

Lauren’s throat tightened.

She let her eyes close.

There was a point—quiet, private—where she stopped resisting and simply allowed herself to be human. The room remained dark, the house remained still, and the memory did what memory could do when it was made of warmth and consent and longing.

Afterwards, the tension in her body eased as if a fist had unclenched.

She lay there with her hand pressed lightly to her own sternum, breathing slow, listening to the ordinary sounds of a house at night. No shame rose up to meet her—only a sober tenderness, and an inconvenient truth she could no longer file away.

Sarah had become real to her.

Not as a problem. Not as a responsibility.

As a woman.

Lauren got up, drank a glass of water, and returned to bed with the calm of someone who had crossed a small internal line and survived it. When sleep finally came, it came gently—less like defeat than like permission.

### Why this works (and why it won’t attract the audience you don’t want)
- It **doesn’t** “show” sex. It shows **Lauren’s private interior life**.
- It avoids body-part focus and keeps the tone **mature, dignified, female**.
- It makes arousal a *consequence of intimacy and safety*, not a voyeuristic event.
- It preserves your larger theme: women as the standard-setters; men as background pressure.

### One more craft trick
If you want to make it even safer: **place the “release” between paragraphs**, as a structural ellipsis. Example:

- Paragraph A: memory builds, breath changes  
- **Blank line**  
- Paragraph B: afterglow, water, calm, insight

That blank line does a lot of tasteful work.

If you want, I can also write the *matching* Sarah-side version later (equally discreet, equally standards-first), so the “spice” feels mutual and not like Lauren is being singled out for private longing.

**Robyn:**

Ideal. That is the tone I'm after, Emily.

And, as a side note, if my "readership" (Watchers) list on DA is any indication, I AM attracting a female audience, much to my delight. Even *IF* some of the 'she/her' tags aren't completely real, as soon as I get into their 'Favourites' I can alway check veracity. I'd say most check out. 

Where do we go from here? Would you be willing to expand Lauren's experience more?

**Emily:**

Yes — and the way you’re thinking about it is exactly right: you’re not “spicing it up,” you’re **deepening Lauren’s interiority** in a way that stays dignified and woman-forward.

### Where we can go from here
You’ve got two strong forward paths that *also* keep the story’s spine intact:

1) **Lauren’s private afterglow → daytime consequences**  
   She doesn’t become flustered or silly. She becomes *clearer*. The next day, she’s more protective of boundaries, more precise, and quietly more honest with herself. The pleasure doesn’t undo her standards; it confirms that she’s alive.

2) **Lauren and Sarah establish the rules of “us”**  
   Not a big “define the relationship” chat—more like women do: gentle, practical, consent-led. A “this is how we keep it safe” agreement. No workplace indulgence. No alcohol-as-courage. No ambiguity around stalking safety.

3) **Parallel: Celeste/Charlotte are stepping into the city**  
   This provides contrast: one couple moving outward into society; the other couple moving inward into private tenderness. Both are women-led, both standards-first.

Given your ask, I’ll expand Lauren’s experience in a way that stays in-bounds: memory, warmth, release implied, and then the *meaning* afterwards.

## Scene — “After” (Lauren POV)

Lauren did not romanticise herself.

If anything, she had spent years doing the opposite—reducing her needs to logistics, filing her own softness under “later,” treating desire as a frivolity she could not afford.

So when Sarah left and the door clicked shut and the house went quiet again, Lauren fully expected to sleep.

She had earned it.

She had done the day properly. She had held the line at Wardrobe. She had made dinner. She had checked the locks. She had sent the final email. She had laid out Charlotte’s things for the morning because a mother’s mind didn’t switch off just because her body was tired.

She had even—unthinkable, really—allowed herself a moment with Sarah that did not become a crisis.

That should have been enough to satisfy the nervous system.

But in the dark, with the lamp off and the doona pulled up to her shoulder, Lauren found herself awake in the way she hadn’t been awake in years.

Not anxious.

Attentive.

Her body lay still. Her mind didn’t.

It drifted—quietly, inexorably—back to the kitchen.

To Sarah’s hands, steady at her waist. Not grabbing. Not claiming. The opposite of entitlement. A touch that waited to be allowed.

To the sound of Sarah’s breath changing when Lauren changed hers—an unconscious synchrony that made Lauren’s chest tighten with a warmth she did not know where to place.

To the ridiculous little click of the kettle, like the house itself had cleared its throat.

Lauren pressed her lips together, almost annoyed at herself.

*This is absurd,* she thought.

But her body, stubborn as truth, began to answer.

The memory was not pornographic. It wasn’t a film reel. It was a collection of small sensory facts: warmth, steadiness, the taste of tea on Sarah’s mouth, the softness of hair against Lauren’s cheek when Sarah had leaned in—something clean and ordinary and real.

Lauren’s throat tightened.

She turned onto her side and stared into the darkness where the window’s faint outline lived, and tried to do the old thing: solve it by thinking.

*Sarah was frightened that first night.*  
*This isn’t that.*  
*She’s sober. I’m sober.*  
*I’m not taking advantage.*  
*I’m not being taken advantage of.*

The list settled her a little, and then—without warning—the thought that unseated her came in with an almost humiliating sweetness:

*She came because she wanted to.*

Not for safety. Not to be saved.

To be with Lauren.

Lauren’s chest tightened hard enough that she drew a slow breath, as if she could control her own ribcage through sheer discipline.

But discipline had never prevented a body from being alive.

Heat gathered, soft and insistent, until Lauren could no longer pretend it was merely “thinking about” something. It was *feeling*. It was the nervous system remembering what it was like to be held and not evaluated.

She shifted under the doona, careful not to wake Charlotte in the next room—not because Charlotte was a child, but because the house had its own quiet agreements, and Lauren respected them.

Her eyes closed.

The mind offered Sarah again, as if memory were a hand returning to a familiar place.

Sarah’s mouth on hers—sober, decided, unhurried.

The brief pause afterwards, when Sarah had looked at her as if waiting for Lauren to decide whether this was real or a kindness.

Lauren had decided.

She let that decision sit in her body now, allowed it to warm her from the inside out.

There came a point—private, unspoken—where she stopped bracing against the feeling as if it were a threat.

She didn’t *perform* anything.

She simply… surrendered to the truth of her own response.

And in that surrender, something loosened.

Not dramatically. Not with fireworks. With the quiet relief of a knot untying after years of being pulled tight.

Afterwards, Lauren lay still, breath slow, one hand resting lightly at her own sternum as if she needed the contact to confirm she was still herself.

She did not feel dirty.

She did not feel foolish.

She felt, in a way that startled her, *calm*.

The tenderness remained, but it was no longer agitating. It had become something like afterglow—warmth without urgency.

Lauren swung her legs out of bed and padded to the kitchen, drank a glass of water, and stood for a moment in the dim light from the rangehood.

The house was quiet.

The world outside was quiet.

Lauren thought: *So this is what it is to want someone and not be punished by it.*

She returned to bed, slid under the doona, and listened to her own breathing until it evened out.

One more thought came—clear, sober, not romanticised:

*This doesn’t make me weak.*

If anything, it made the shape of the next step obvious.

Not a leap into chaos.

A conversation.

Rules that honoured what had happened without turning it into a secret shame.

Safety first. Respect first. Policies first.

But also—

A life.

A small, warm life in which Lauren was allowed, occasionally, to be more than consequence.

When sleep finally came, it came gently—less like collapse than like permission.

---

### Options for the next scene (you can pick, or I’ll just keep going)
If we continue immediately, the most natural follow-up is one of these:

1) **Morning after: Lauren is sharper—but softer around Sarah** (not flirting; just a new steadiness).  
2) **A practical talk between Lauren and Sarah** (no melodrama: “what are our rules so we don’t make this messy?”).  
3) **A small trigger at Wardrobe** (a courier, a “curious” outsider, or even a remark) that tests whether Lauren can keep her feelings private *without* becoming cold.

If you don’t want to choose, I’ll go with #2 because it’s the most women-forward and keeps your “standards-first” ethos pristine while still letting the romance deepen.

**Robyn:**

I agree: #2. Oh and, just for continuity, Charlotte is actually living with Celeste now. please continue. We could make Sarah's visits to Lauren an increasing thing... something Sarah suggests, suddenly, unexpectedly almost derailing the "what are our rules" chat. A human touch. And Lauren responds so profoundly Sarah notices and relishes... confirmation: "she IS into me!"

**Emily:**

### Scene — “Rules” (Lauren POV)

Lauren didn’t sleep late.

She never had. Even when she’d been younger and had fewer reasons to be vigilant, her body kept its own hours. Now, it was simply efficient: wake, inventory the day, begin.

She’d already been up long enough to make tea and stand at the kitchen sink looking out at nothing in particular when her phone buzzed.

**Sarah:** *Can I come by after work. Just… for a bit.*

Lauren stared at the message for one breath too long.

Her fingers hovered over the screen, the part of her that still wanted to appear unbothered wrestling with the part of her that had, last night, been privately and unmistakably human.

She typed:

*Yes.*

Then deleted it.

Typed again:

*Of course. What time?*

Better. Neutral. Practical. Like a woman whose pulse wasn’t doing small, embarrassing things.

Sarah replied almost immediately.

*7ish. I’ll bring dinner or something.*

Lauren’s mouth tightened—almost a smile.

*No need. I’ve got dinner. Just come.*

She put the phone down and felt, for the first time in a while, the strange sensation of looking forward to evening.

Not the relief of the day ending.

The anticipation of someone arriving.

---

Wardrobe ran the way it ran now: the tightened perimeter made everything feel cleaner, less porous. No phones. No casual hovering. No curious men lingering at the threshold like the place was a novelty. Everyone did their work. Everyone knew the rules.

Lauren liked it that way.

She noticed Sarah, of course.

Not in a dramatic way. Not in a way that interfered with policy.

But Lauren’s mind had become inconveniently aware of Sarah’s small truths: how she stood when she was tired, the way her voice dropped when she was serious, the little tilt of her head before a joke that wasn’t a joke.

Sarah caught her looking once and lifted her brows as if to say, *still doing that, are we?*

Lauren looked away as if she hadn’t been.

The day moved.

The work moved.

And when seven arrived, Lauren was already home, already fed Charlotte’s cat out of habit—then remembered, with a quiet little ache, that Charlotte wasn’t here anymore. She was with Celeste now. Living there. Building that life.

Lauren liked that.

She would not admit out loud that she missed the sound of Charlotte moving around the house.

She checked the chain on the door anyway. Habit.

Then she heard the car pull up.

A knock—light, not demanding.

Lauren opened the door.

Sarah stood there with a paper bag from a takeaway place in one hand and that look in her eyes again—less swagger, more sincerity than Sarah was comfortable displaying in public.

“I brought dumplings,” Sarah said quickly, as if the words were armour. “In case you didn’t—”

“I did,” Lauren replied. “But come in anyway.”

Sarah stepped inside, and the air of the house changed simply because she was in it.

Lauren shut the door, slid the chain, then turned back with the practical calm she used when she didn’t want to let emotion make her clumsy.

“Tea?” Lauren asked.

Sarah’s eyes flicked to Lauren’s mouth, then away again like she’d been caught.

“Yes,” Sarah said. “God, yes.”

Lauren put the kettle on, because of course she did. Some rituals were becoming a theme.

They sat at the kitchen table with two mugs between them, steam rising, the takeaway bag unopened like a prop neither of them needed yet.

Lauren folded her hands.

“Alright,” she said. “We need to talk.”

Sarah huffed a laugh. “You say that like you’re about to put me on a performance plan.”

“I might,” Lauren said dryly. “Depending on your answers.”

Sarah’s smile softened. “Okay. Talk.”

Lauren watched her for a beat—this woman who had walked into her life like a storm, then proven she could be… steady, when it mattered.

Lauren spoke clearly, the way she spoke when policy mattered.

“First,” Lauren said, “this does not happen at work.”

Sarah nodded instantly. “Agreed.”

“No flirting, no touching, no private conversations in the back room,” Lauren continued. “No ambiguous behaviour that could be misread. Wardrobe stays a women’s domain, not a soap opera.”

Sarah’s grin sharpened. “You’re really determined to make this boring.”

“Yes,” Lauren replied. “Boring is safe.”

Sarah’s expression sobered. “I can do boring,” she said quietly. “I want safe.”

Lauren nodded once. “Second: no alcohol as courage.”

Sarah exhaled. “Yep.”

Lauren’s gaze held hers. “If either of us needs a drink to say or do something, we don’t say or do it.”

“Agreed,” Sarah said, and meant it.

“Third,” Lauren said, “we do not let this become your refuge from the stalking situation or my refuge from loneliness. We deal with problems directly. We don’t… hide in each other.”

Sarah blinked, a flicker of defensiveness rising, then dying as she realised Lauren wasn’t accusing. She was protecting.

“Okay,” Sarah said slowly. “That’s fair.”

Lauren’s voice softened—barely. “Good.”

Sarah stared at her mug, then looked up again, and the mischievous part of her returned like it couldn’t tolerate sincerity for too long.

“So,” Sarah said, “basically: no workplace kissing, no drunk kissing, no trauma-bonding.”

Lauren’s mouth tightened. “Correct.”

Sarah leaned back and studied her, eyes bright.

“And what about… us,” Sarah asked, the words casual but the question not.

Lauren’s pulse made itself known in her throat.

“We’re… exploring,” Lauren said carefully, and hated how inadequate the word felt.

Sarah’s mouth tilted. “Exploring,” she repeated, amused.

Lauren held her gaze. “Yes. With boundaries.”

Sarah nodded, then let a beat of silence sit—an unusual restraint for Sarah.

And then, abruptly—like she couldn’t help herself—she said:

“I want to come here more.”

Lauren’s breath caught.

Sarah rushed on, suddenly too fast, suddenly vulnerable under the bravado.

“Not in a weird way. Not moving in. I’m not trying to—” She waved a hand, as if swatting away the image of herself being clingy. “But I… like being here. I like you. And I don’t want this to be a once-a-week, polite little thing where we pretend we’re not thinking about each other the rest of the time.”

Lauren went very still.

This was the moment that could derail the whole careful structure—could turn “rules” into something too exposed, too hopeful.

Lauren felt the old reflex to manage it: to say *we’ll see,* to keep it controlled, to protect herself from disappointment.

But she remembered the other truth—the one she’d learned in the dark last night, alone:

Wanting did not make her weak.

Pretending she didn’t want was what made her brittle.

Lauren looked at Sarah and let herself answer honestly.

“You can come here more,” Lauren said.

Sarah blinked.

Lauren continued, voice steady. “You can come after work. You can come for dinner. You can come and sit on my couch and talk nonsense. You can fall asleep watching something stupid if you want to. You don’t have to earn access to my home by being in crisis.”

Sarah’s mouth parted slightly, the mask slipping clean off.

Lauren’s chest tightened, and she added—quietly, like she was stating a fact, not begging:

“I like having you here.”

Sarah stared at her for a beat too long.

Then her face softened in a way that made her look younger, almost stunned.

“Oh,” Sarah whispered.

Lauren held her gaze. “Yes.”

Sarah swallowed, eyes brightening with something she tried, unsuccessfully, to hide.

“You’re… really into me,” Sarah said, half laugh, half disbelief.

Lauren’s mouth twitched—an actual smile now, small but unmistakable.

“I am,” Lauren said simply. “And you’re not going to make me apologise for it.”

Sarah’s laugh broke out, breathy and delighted, and she dropped her head for a second as if she couldn’t contain it. When she looked up again her eyes were shining.

“God,” Sarah said softly. “I thought I was imagining it. That look.”

Lauren felt heat rise in her face—annoying, adolescent, undeniable.

“I didn’t mean to look,” Lauren said, which was not quite true.

Sarah leaned forward, elbows on the table, voice warm now. “Yes you did.”

Lauren’s eyes narrowed. “Careful.”

Sarah grinned, then sobered—quick, sincere.

“I won’t mess this up,” Sarah said. “I swear. I’ll do boring. I’ll do safe. I’ll do policies.”

Lauren exhaled slowly, feeling something in her chest unclench.

“Good,” she said.

Sarah glanced at the takeaway bag, then back at Lauren. “Can I stay tonight,” she asked, and then immediately added, “Not like— I mean, I can sleep on the couch—”

Lauren cut her off without hesitation.

“You can stay,” Lauren said.

Sarah froze, then blinked rapidly as if she needed to verify she’d heard correctly.

Lauren stood, practical as ever, and reached for an extra mug as if this was normal, as if her house had always contained two women and not just one.

“We’ll keep it simple,” Lauren said. “Tea. Dumplings. Then we’ll work out the rest like adults.”

Sarah stood too, moving closer, the space between them narrowing with that quiet inevitability.

She didn’t grab. She didn’t rush.

She looked at Lauren—open, sober, hopeful—and said softly, “Thank you.”

Lauren held her gaze, and in that look there was no ambiguity left to torment Sarah.

“Of course,” Lauren said. “Now. Eat. You look like you’ve been living on spite.”

Sarah laughed—full, delighted, relieved—and for the first time in a long time, the sound felt like it belonged in Lauren’s kitchen.

Like it was meant to be there.

And Lauren—still fiercely herself, still standards-first—found herself thinking with a quiet, terrifying certainty:

This was not a detour.

This was a new part of her life.

**Robyn:**

Good morning, Emily. Please write a context summary of this thread's contents.

**Emily:**

Here’s a clean context summary you can paste into a new thread.

---

## Context Summary — Wardrobe Arc (Direction E, boundaries, romance, privacy)

### Direction & tone
- The story commits to **Direction E**: Sharl’s feminine self becomes explicit, but stays **respectful, realistic, and non-coercive**.
- Guardrails: **no “tests,” no gotchas, no coercion**; everything framed as **comfort, consent, function**, not spectacle. Outward change is incremental and chosen; supervision exists socially/medically, but the story avoids clinical focus on-page.
- Sharl/Charlotte knows she doesn’t want reversal; the arc is one of **settling into true self**, with women providing stable standards and a safe domain rather than forcing outcomes.

### Sharl → Charlotte progression
- Time passes; Sharl has been on **anti-androgens** for months. Estradiol’s effects are implied as gradual and quiet.
- A key internal beat: Sharl looks in the mirror, sees herself properly, and softly says “**good girl**” to herself.
- Body changes alter garment fit: Mara matter-of-factly tells her she can’t test “nymph” silhouettes anymore because her shape has shifted (hips/containment), moving into a “well-nourished” class of fit issues—useful for Wardrobe’s craft.

### Wardrobe business expansion & governance
- US winter orders (Thanksgiving pageants, Christmas plays) increase; **money is real**, atelier feels cramped; outsourcing is debated (quality control and standards remain core).
- Celeste approaches graduation; she and Mara settle on a **capacity ceiling** for work/life balance. Sarah nudges Mara into **oil painting**, which becomes Mara’s reflective outlet.

### The privacy breach & response
- Part-timer **Annie** violates policy by filming inside Wardrobe for TikTok despite a strict **no photos/filming** rule.
- Annie is caught and dismissed swiftly (consequence-first). Some footage still goes viral, creating a new threat: **exposure + curious outsiders**, especially risky for Charlotte.
- Response sequence:
  - Celeste sees the clip first and chooses not to expose Charlotte to it raw; tells her calmly and centers **Charlotte’s agency**.
  - Emergency meeting: **Lauren (process/consequences), Mara (scorched-earth standards), Celeste (protect without infantilising), Sarah (door/teeth), Charlotte (agency and procedure).**
  - Charlotte decides: no public response, tighten routines and access, lock fitting space, schedule adjustments around couriers; “not shame—sensible gates.”
  - A “curious” man attempts entry; Sarah and Lauren enforce boundaries and remove him. Wardrobe becomes fully “ordinary” as a women’s domain again—couriers are courteous and leave.

### Celeste & Charlotte romance and city shift
- Celeste recognises she’s in love with a girl; the relationship stays **quiet, safe, respectful**, with Wardrobe as a sanctuary.
- Celeste/Charlotte have a sensory-rich breakfast scene: Charlotte becomes more aware of smell/color; Celeste calls her “**Charlotte**” as a landmark moment.
- Intimacy is treated as **private and earned**; the narrative cuts away from explicitness.
- Celeste considers moving from current home to a **downtown Melbourne apartment** after graduation; commute to the Faire by train together. Charlotte wants the city too—curiosity and a wider life beyond “one safe room.” Lauren supports with “procedure replaces culture”: safety rules, location sharing, transport, filming response, etc.

### Lauren & Sarah emotional arc
- “Lauren’s Loneliness”: Lauren can’t stop thinking about Sarah’s earlier kiss; wonders if it’s loneliness or mutual interest.
- Sarah POV (“That Look”): she senses Lauren’s gaze and wants clarity; they later adopt **decorum and distance** to mull feelings privately.
- Desired erotic tone: **delicate, non-graphic, female-audience–forward**. A sample “After” scene shows Lauren privately aroused by memory of Sarah; implied pleasurable release without explicit mechanics; focus on meaning, safety, and afterglow.
- Friday night turning point: Sarah, about to order a drink, has an epiphany—no alcohol-as-courage. She calls Lauren at 9pm; Lauren tries to sound neutral but is eager and lets it slip. Sarah comes over; warmth, safety, kettle clicking off as they hug/kiss.
- Sarah confides in friend **Tania** (in a relationship) about Friday night; Tania is happy but cautious. Sarah insists: “We’re not blokes—**safety first, respect first, policies first**.”
- Next: Lauren and Sarah have a **rules talk** (no workplace romance behavior, no alcohol-as-courage, no using each other as refuge from stalking/loneliness). Sarah unexpectedly asks to come over more often. Lauren responds profoundly—invites her more frequently, says she likes having Sarah there, allows staying over (couch if needed). Sarah’s delighted confirmation: Lauren truly is into her.

### Thematic spine
- Wardrobe is a **women’s competence network** and a **safe domain** maintained by policy, boundaries, and consequence.
- Romance and transformation are framed through **agency, dignity, interiority**, and **women-led standards**, avoiding voyeurism and male-gaze cues.
- Two parallel couples evolve as slow-burn, with **Celeste and Lauren** as stabilising power sources; Charlotte and Sarah grow into security through that structure.
