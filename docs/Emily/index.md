Emily and I have been writing for a while. This is our blow-by-blow, as close as I can document it.

Note:
*Note: This is an edited transcript of my writing process with an AI assistant (“Emily”).*    
**I use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for the work of writing.**

Removed all the hand-copied pages... they were getting messy. And replaced them with the ability to search conversations with Emily via the 'Search' (at the top of the page). It works a treat, is far more accurate and takes up a lot less space, and requires **no** time to generate.

What is 'Celestes Girl'?

Celeste's Girl is a story about being in a public space as a woman and the quiet maths women do to stay safe.

Celeste's Girl is about agency, dignity, lived experience.

All my so-called artwork, including any descriptive text, depicts adults: no images involve persons less that 18 years old. I abhor depictions of harm or violence towards anyone, but most particularly towards women and children. None of the images reflect actual events.

As CelestesGrl, I reserve exclusive ownership of the art that I post on Deviant Art, visual, auditory and text (literature). I no longer do derivative art. Downloading is permitted for your personal enjoyment or creating derivations. You may create new, transformative derivatives, including remixes, reinterpretations, new compositions. Please do NOT upload near-identical copies (including “same image with denoise / filters / upscale”), as that’s not transformative.

**Important Note**: *I’m revising older ("old-tone") deviations to match the direction of my work now: agency, dignity and empathy. I am phasing out ‘old-tone’ uploads. This will mean that if you favourited an 'old-tone' image, the replacement image and description will almost certainly send a different message to the original. If the 'old-tone' images are what you are here for, it’s probably best to unfollow. No hard feelings*.
