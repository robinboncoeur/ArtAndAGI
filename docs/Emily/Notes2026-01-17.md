# Notes 13-Jan-2026


## Context summary
Hi Emily. Before we move on, I've been revisiting previous scenes, with the purpose of adding illustrations. For example, here's Charlie outide of the Historical Faire maintenance yard reading the scrap of paper Mara gave Graham to give to him, offering him work at Wardrobe.

I'm now on Scene 5 "Second Day". I've done a bit of firming up: please let me know what you think:

Scene 5
Second Day

[Celeste POV]

Mara doesn’t test people the way teachers do.

Teachers announce the test, watch you sweat, and then moralise the result. Mara tests you the way you test a seam: under her fingers, quietly, looking for strain. Charlie was back next morning: same early arrival, same clean hands, same careful stillness, as if he didn’t want the room to notice he’d come in. Mara noticed everything. She didn’t say hello. She pointed at a tin on the table.

“Pins,” she told him. “Sort them. Then you’re on the mending pile.”

Charlie nodded once and moved, no dramatics. He poured the pins out onto a cloth and began arranging them by length with a kind of tidy focus that made the task look dignified. I was at the rail, tagging garment bags, listening to the hiss of the steamer and the small scrape of hangers sliding, sensing the beeswax and chalk dust in the drawers. 

Wardrobe had its own rhythm — calm on the surface, precise underneath — and Charlie had already started matching it without being told. That was his first tell: he could join a system without trying to dominate it.

Mara’s next marker came ten minutes later, when she “accidentally” left a pair of vintage shears too close to the edge of the table. A tiny trial: a valuable tool sitting in the wrong place. A careless person would ignore it and let it fall. A nervous person would unceremoniously grab it and dump it. Charlie had noticed it: his eyes flicked to it, then to Mara. He didn’t touch the shears but nudged the cloth closer, stabilised the table edge with his palm, and slid the shears back with two fingers — carefully, respectfully — like returning a bird to its perch.

Mara didn’t look up, but I saw the smallest change in her mouth: the line eased by a millimetre. Ten minutes after that, she called across the room, voice neutral.

“Rossignol. Bring me the blue painter’s tape.”

Charlie paused, his gaze shifting to the shelves. There were three blue tapes of different widths. He didn’t guess. He looked once at Mara, then asked — quietly:

“Which width?”

Mara’s eyes lifted. She held his gaze for a beat. “Quarter-inch.”

Charlie retrieved the roll and brought it to her.

“Good.”

Just that. One syllable. It landed like a stamp. Charlie went faintly pink at the ears anyway, as if the word had surprised him. I kept my eyes on the tags, but my attention drifted to him. I watched people the way you watched fabric: how it fell, where it pulled, what it revealed when it thought nobody was looking.

Charlie’s attention to Mara was respect. Charlie’s attention to the room was caution. 

Charlie’s attention to me was different. It wasn’t the obvious stare you got from boys who thought you existed to be noticed. It wasn’t even the furtive kind. It was as if his eyes kept finding me on their own, the way a compass needle finds north, and each time he realised, he corrected himself like it was a breach. He was trying not to.

Which made his attention almost endearing. Almost.

Mara sent him to the mending pile: a basket of small catastrophes: popped seams, torn cuffs, fraying apron ties. She didn’t give him the easy ones: she gave him the ones where haste would show. Charlie sat, assessed each item the way he’d assessed the torn dress yesterday: calmly, quietly. He chose thread that matched without holding it up to the light like a show. He measured seam allowance with his eye, then confirmed with a tape. He stitched with even tension, no puckering, no desperate pulling.

Half an hour later, Mara handed Charlie a garment bag.

“Hang that.”

It was heavier than it looked — wool, boning, metal closures. Charlie took it with both hands. He carried it the way you carried something that mattered, and when he reached the rail he stopped and looked at the rail, checking spacing, weight distribution, the hook’s position — like he was thinking not of this one garment but of the system as a whole. Then he hung it in a place that made sense, not in the first empty gap.

Mara watched him. She didn’t praise him nor did have to correct him. That was Mara’s version of warmth. When she moved away, I stepped closer to Charlie’s table, because it was time to introduce the next lesson, and because I’d been told — explicitly — not to hover. I was not told not to function.

“You’re stitching like you’ve done this for years.”

Charlie’s hands paused for half a second, needle hovering. Then he kept going.

“My mum,” he said, voice low. “She... she showed me. If you make it neat, people pay.”

“That’s true,” I replied. “And if you make it neat here, Mara doesn’t kill you.”

His mouth twitched in a small smile he didn’t quite permit to exist. I watched his eyes flick up to my face, and then away again too fast, like touching a hot surface.

“Thanks.”

“For what?”

He swallowed. “For... yesterday. For - for getting me in.”

I let a beat pass. I didn’t want gratitude. Gratitude can turn into dependence, and dependence can rot a person.

“*You* got you in, Charlie,” I said. “You turned up. You work. Mara cares about that.”

His shoulders loosened slightly, like that was a relief. He threaded another needle, hands steady. Then, without looking at me, he murmured,

“I’m not... I’m not trying to be weird.”

“Weird? Weird how?”

His ears went a deeper pink. He frowned at the fabric as if it had betrayed him.

“I just—” He stopped. The words clogged. It was there, in the stall between his sentences: the thing he didn’t want to say because saying it would make it an admission, turn it into a liability. I knew what was trying to say, except he couldn't. So I did what I always do: I decided what would happen next.

“You mean you don’t want to make me uncomfortable,” I said evenly.

His head snapped up. Hazel eyes, startled. Then he looked down again, quick as shame.

“Yes,” he whispered.

“That’s good. Keep it that way.”

He nodded quickly, like he’d been given a rule and was relieved. Then, because his brain was honest even when his mouth wanted to be cautious, he added,

“It’s just... you’re... you’re a lot.”

I blinked.

“A lot?”

He winced as if he’d just spilled ink. “Not... not bad. I mean, you’re... you make things - make sense.”

It was Charlie’s version of a crush: not desire as entitlement, but admiration as gravity. I froze a threatening smile: he would have read it as mockery. I let it sit between us, uninflated. He was not seeking romance, but structure.

“You’re allowed to admire,” I said. “Just don’t let it derail you.”

His eyes flicked to mine: confused, searching. I continued, calmly:

“You’ve been living in rooms where you can’t win. Wardrobe is a room where you can. If you have strong feelings... aim them at your work. That will keep you safe.”

He stared at me, stunned by the fact I’d named it without accusing him of anything.

“Okay.”

I glanced at the garment in his hands. “Be sure to make that repair invisible. Mara hates visible.”

He almost smiled again. I turned to go back to the rail, and that’s when he said it — what mattered.

“I’m not going back next year,” he muttered. “To school.”

I stopped, hand on a garment bag.

“What do you mean?”

He looked at his stitches. Not me. “I’m wagging it. I can’t... do it again. They just— they don’t—” He shook his head once, small and furious. “It’s a waste.”

He said it like it was a plan, not a knife-edge. I walked back to him and placed my finger lightly on the fabric near his seam — not touching him, just anchoring the moment.

“No.” My voice was flat.

“No?”

“You’re not wagging,” I replied. Simple. Not a debate.

His jaw tightened. “Why do you care?”

I held his gaze. “Mara will train you,” I said. “Your mum will back you. I can point you at doors. But if you sabotage your own foundation, you’ll spend your whole life needing someone to catch you.”

His throat bobbed. He looked away.

“That’s not fair,” he muttered.

“I’m not trying to be fair,” I said.  “I’m being accurate.”

He stared at his hands as if they belonged to someone else. I softened a fraction: not into comfort, into clarity.

“If school is the wrong language,” I said, “we’ll find you translation. But you don’t get to disappear. That’s the old you talking.”

He swallowed. “I don’t know how to do it.”

“Then you learn,” I said, and let a small edge of humour in, because humour makes medicine swallowable. “You’re doing a whole new trade. You can learn Year Twelve.”

His mouth twitched. He didn’t say yes. He didn’t say no. But he didn’t argue either.

That, for Charlie, was progress. Across the room, Mara’s voice cut through the hiss of the steamer.

“Rossignol!”

Charlie’s head snapped up immediately.

“Yes?”

Mara held up a sleeve with a tear near the cuff.

“This one. If you stitch it tight, I’ll know. And you’ll unpick it in front of everyone.”

Charlie went very still. Then he spoke, clear and calm.

“Okay.”

He rose, took the sleeve, and walked to Mara’s table with the careful confidence of someone who had found a rule-set that didn’t hate him. Before he left me, his eyes flicked to my face again — quick, warm, grateful, frightened — and then away.

I watched him go and thought: he’s going to learn that being chosen is not a miracle. It’s a responsibility.

And I’m not letting him waste it.



<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">










Robyn, this is *very* on-voice for Celeste and it’s doing several hard jobs at once: (1) establishing Wardrobe’s culture as a system (not a vibe), (2) letting Mara “approve” without sentimentality, (3) giving Charlie a way to succeed that isn’t charisma, and (4) letting Celeste be the one who names what’s happening and sets the rules.

A few thoughts, split into **what’s landing**, **what I’d tweak**, and **a couple of micro line-edits** you can just lift.

---

## The illustration (Charlie in the maintenance yard)

It reads cleanly as *“threshold moment”*: the forklift + wrapped pallet says “worksite / logistics / real labour,” and Charlie’s posture (head down, absorbed in the scrap) sells that he’s *already halfway inside* Wardrobe’s world before he even arrives. The surrounding buildings give “historic precinct” without needing costumes in-frame, which is perfect for an early illustration: we feel the environment’s authority, not the glamour.

If you do a companion image later, a nice pair would be: **the same stance**, but now he’s holding a garment bag ticket or ledger slip *inside* Wardrobe—visual rhyme: paper → belonging.

---

## What’s already strong in Scene 5

### 1) Mara’s testing logic is *exactly right*

The seam-testing metaphor is the right kind of quiet menace: not teacherly, not performative, just “show me what you are when nobody claps.” That’s Wardrobe’s ethos in one move.

### 2) Charlie’s competence is shown as *boring and precise*

Sorting pins by length, matching thread without theatrics, checking rail spacing/weight distribution—this is “wife-work” in the structural sense: anticipatory, system-minded, non-ego. It’s attractive for the *right* reasons.

### 3) Celeste’s power reads as governance, not mood

You do a great thing here: Celeste doesn’t *comfort*, she *sets policy*. The “gratitude rots into dependence” line is very Celeste—and very Wardrobe. She keeps him upright rather than held.

### 4) The crush beat is handled with discipline

It’s not “ooh he’s into her”; it’s “his focus is drifting toward the north star; she notices; she contains it; she turns it into fuel.” That’s the dynamic you want.

---

## What I would tweak (to sharpen impact and keep continuity)

### A) Watch a tiny bit of “explaining the intention” in a few spots

You’re mostly “show, don’t tell,” but you occasionally name the mechanism in a way that slightly smooths the grit. Example:

> “That was his first tell: he could join a system without trying to dominate it.”

That sentence is true, but you’ve *already shown it.* If you want the line, consider making it more Celeste: less authorial, more proprietary appraisal.

Something like:

* “He didn’t try to improve anything. He just joined it.”
* “He didn’t arrive with opinions. He arrived with attention.”

### B) “I froze a threatening smile” is the one phrase that snagged me

It’s vivid, but “froze” + “threatening smile” risks reading like she’s doing a villain face. Celeste’s strength is quieter: she keeps her expression *flat*, or *gentle* in a way that still controls the room.

Options:

* “I kept my mouth neutral. He would’ve mistaken warmth for permission.”
* “I let my expression stay blank. He needed clarity, not encouragement.”

### C) The shears test is excellent, but you can make Mara’s “accident” even more plausible

Right now it’s clearly a test (which is fine), but if you want it to feel less staged, make it a *realistic near-miss* in a busy room:

* she sets them down to reach for something,
* the tape measure snags,
* the shears creep toward the edge.

Then Charlie’s response feels even more like “instinctive care” rather than “passing a scenario.”

### D) The school “No.” is perfect—consider trimming the exchange by a few lines

The *power* is in how quickly Celeste ends the fantasy of self-sabotage. You can keep the whole conversation, but if you want it to hit like a stamp (like Mara’s “Good.”), shorten slightly so Celeste’s “accurate” lands harder.

### E) Tiny continuity: Charlie vs Charli

In later Wardrobe scenes you’ve moved the workplace identity to she/her. Here, you’re intentionally still in “Charlie” era, which is fine—just be conscious of when Wardrobe officially flips. This scene feels like it’s still “Charlie,” which makes sense as Day Two.

---

## Micro line edits (a few surgical fixes)

1. Grammar:

> “She didn’t praise him nor did have to correct him.”
> → “She didn’t praise him, nor did she have to correct him.”

2. Tighten a repeat:

> “Charlie’s attention to Mara was respect. Charlie’s attention to the room was caution.”
> You could make this sharper and more rhythmic:

* “With Mara, he was respectful. With the room, cautious.”

3. Clarify this (it’s good, just slightly clunky):

> “I was not told not to function.”
> Maybe:

* “I hadn’t been told not to be useful.”

4. This is great but can be even colder (in a good way):

> “That’s good. Keep it that way.”
> Celeste could make it policy-sounding:

* “Good. Maintain that.”

5. “You’re a lot” beat: small tweak to make it less teen-romcom and more “structure hunger”
   Right now it works, but if you want it to feel less like flirtation:

* “It’s just… you’re… decisive.”
* “You make the room stop lying.”

---

## Two optional punch-up rewrites (pick-and-mix)

### 1) Replace the “first tell” sentence

Original:

> “That was his first tell: he could join a system without trying to dominate it.”

Alternative:

> “He didn’t try to improve anything. He just matched the rhythm.”

### 2) Replace “I froze a threatening smile…”

Original:

> “I froze a threatening smile: he would have read it as mockery.”

Alternative:

> “I kept my expression neutral. He would’ve mistaken amusement for cruelty, and cruelty for permission.”

---

## What I think you’ve achieved (and why it matters)

This scene quietly codifies Wardrobe’s moral universe:

* **Mara** is the standard (non-negotiable, impersonal, fair in a way that doesn’t soothe).
* **Celeste** is governance (she names dynamics, sets boundaries, redirects emotion into competence).
* **Charlie** is viable because he’s already behaving like someone who can live inside women’s rules without needing to be special.

And that last line you end on—

> “being chosen is not a miracle. It’s a responsibility.”

—that’s *the thesis* of this whole arc, stated without sermonising.

If you want, I can do a “tightened cut” pass where I keep every beat but shave ~10–15% of the words (mostly repeats and a couple of explanatory lines) so the scene reads even more like a stamped ledger entry: clean, inevitable, hard to argue with.

<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:pink;background-color:pink">











Lovely — and that makes perfect sense. The softened tone is doing a quiet but important thing here: it keeps Celeste *authoritative* without making her feel like she’s performing authority. The scene becomes easier to read because it flows like real observation instead of a series of “moves.”

If you want to preserve that softness going forward (without losing the steel), here are a few **house rules** you’ve already instinctively followed in this draft—worth keeping in mind as you revise earlier scenes for consistency:

* **Let Mara’s approval stay microscopic.** One syllable, a millimetre, a corrected tool position. Readers lean in.
* **Keep Celeste’s power procedural.** She doesn’t “win” arguments; she sets the terms so the argument never happens.
* **Let Charlie’s crush stay structural.** He admires competence and clarity; it reads cleaner and avoids melodrama.
* **Make tenderness a by-product of standards.** Warmth comes from “you can succeed here” rather than “I feel sorry for you.”

And because you’re in illustration mode: this scene has three *very drawable* beats that match the softer tone:

1. **Pins on cloth** — hands, small order, morning light. (Quiet competence.)
2. **Shears returned to safety** — two fingers, the edge of a table, Mara’s mouth easing. (Approval without speech.)
3. **The sleeve threat** — Mara holding the torn cuff; Charlie’s stillness. (Rules made visible.)

Whenever you’re ready, paste your revised Scene 5 into the sequence and I’ll help you check continuity against Scene 4 and Scene 6—especially the gradual ramp from “noticed” to “named,” and where exactly Wardrobe’s language begins to shift around Charlie.
