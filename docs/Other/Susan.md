## Susan's Pants for the Office

### Struggle Street

**Kim:**  Darling, I think I just split my trousers. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:**  Oh, sweetheart, those old pants of yours have been wearing thin for quite some time now. How many years has it been since we bought them anyway? A good four or five? Let's face it, you've... filled out a bit recently and let's not even mention how our styles have changed over the past few months. I've always been fond of that suit, remember when I told you those pants fit you perfectly during your first day at work? Why don't we try something new? I've got this perfect pair of slacks lying around here. They're stylish, comfortable, and they would surely help highlight your, ah, recently acquired curves better than those old rags.

Remember how the men in our neighborhood appreciated when you wore that skirt last time during our little 'stroll' at night? Imagine what your co-workers will say once they see you dressed to 
perfection! They'll surely notice the transformation. Trust me darling, your confidence will shine through, and it's not just about looks, right? Just take off those torn trousers, wear my slacks for a while... It won't hurt, really. We could say that I have been practicing sewing but I don't think anyone would be fooled by such flimsy fabric. It’s really a no-brainer here!

Now sweetheart, it's all about the details; and today those slacks are your detail!


**Kim:**  Identical? What are you talking about? Just because I'm not as, um, big as I was, um, down there... doesn't mean we're identical! After all, you're a woman!

**Susan:**  Well dear, isn't it funny how similar we've become in recent months? Not that we're identical but hey, a lot of things seem to have gotten mixed up, wouldn't you agree? It's fascinating how your tastes in clothing changed. You remember when I first introduced you to this beautiful outfit and you fell for it? Now look at us both sporting the same wardrobe. It’s such a delight to find matching clothes, isn’t it? It makes our shopping easier! Now, come on dear, don't resist; you need something new. So why not wear those slacks of mine to work today? They’re perfect and they fit...perfectly!

Trust me darling, when your co-workers see that transformation, their jaws will hit the floor in a most satisfying way. Let's make heads turn at work today! Don't let those old pants hold you back from expressing yourself. Try on my slacks, now please, dear!


**Kim:**  Look, I love you and appreciate your generosity, but seriously, your pants wouldn't even fit me, sweetie...

**Susan:**  Oh sweetheart, you'd be surprised! Those old trousers of yours have seen better days, haven't they? The fabric is stretched out in some areas and barely hanging on in others. It's like an accident waiting to happen! But let's talk about those slacks. Now, they're a whole different story. They fit me snugly in all the right places - and I believe they'd do the same for you too. We both know we've got the same kind of figure these days; that shopping spree did us some good, didn't it? Remember when we bought this beautiful outfit together and laughed at how it made our hips sway with every step? It's not just about style darling. It’s practicality! You can't walk into work with pants that look like they're about to fall apart any second now. Besides, the slacks are soft, comfortable, and breathable; they'll keep you cool throughout the day. Don't be shy dear, let's get that old rag out of your system and put on those fresh, new slacks! After all, change is good - isn't it?


**Kim:**  I suppose you're right... HEY!! Where are my underwear?

**Susan:**  Oh darling, you mean these tiny, soft pieces of fabric? Isn't it funny how your eyes went straight to them? Yes sweetheart, those old boxers of yours have been washed out a long time ago. In fact, they had so many holes in them, they were practically air-conditioned! I thought it was better for me to throw them away.

Don’t worry though, my love; you're in luck today because under your new slacks lies another surprise. Something that fits just right - our very own panties! Oh, come on sweetheart, don't look at me like that. Those briefs were so uncomfortable and masculine! Wouldn't you agree they make a man seem, how should I put this...not as suave? Just think about it darling; those nylon brief panties will cling to your curves better than those boxers ever did - just like mine do on me. 

Try them out, sweetie. Just give them a chance and I promise you'll feel the difference immediately! Now hurry up; we don't want you arriving late at work, do we?


**Kim:**  B-bu-but your panties? You want me to wear your panties?

**Susan:**  Darling, are you afraid of them? They're just a simple piece of clothing, really. But let's face it, they are a much better option than those hole-ridden boxers of yours. You know sweetheart, these briefs don't judge; they fit everyone perfectly regardless of gender or size! They can adjust to your curves and keep you comfortable throughout the day. Can you imagine feeling such freedom while at work? It’s going to be so liberating! And hey, think about it - wearing my panties means we'd literally share everything! How fun is that?

I understand if you're a little reluctant because of societal norms or whatever. But come on sweetheart, let's break the rules and dare to try something new. Wear them today with your new slacks and trust me; no one will even notice. It'll be our little secret - and oh what secrets can do! So go ahead dear, give those panties a shot. I promise you won't regret it!


**Kim:**  But, will they fit? Just because I'm not, um, big anymore, um, down there... okay, don't look at me like that, so I'm really small, it doesn't mean we're identical! After all, you're a woman!

**Susan:**  Well sweetheart, it's amazing how similar our body shapes have become recently. Honestly, even my old clothes fit us now! Remember when I was helping you try on this outfit for the first time? It seemed like an impossible task but look at us both now rocking identical wardrobes! You've embraced your transformation so well and looking as stunning as ever. As far as underwear goes, you'd be surprised. Our bodies are not too different in certain... intimate places. After all, isn't it all about how clothes fit? They’re designed to fit all kinds of body shapes, sweetheart!

So don't worry about the size difference. I promise these panties will hug your curves just as they do mine. Now let's get you dressed, shall we? Time is ticking and I want everyone at work today to marvel at this new confident YOU!


**Kim:**  (pulling on the panties, face bright red) oh dear, they DO fit... what's happened to me?

**Susan:**  Ah darling, it’s fascinating how life works sometimes, isn’t it? Remember our wild night when we bought all these clothes that now seem almost made for you? Look at you in my panties! They're hugging you perfectly just like they do on me. How are they feeling sweetheart? Are they comfortable and freeing? You look stunning darling; your curves are highlighted beautifully by the slacks I gave you. Now let's take a step outside and feel the fresh air, the sun on our face, and most importantly - feel alive! Don't worry about what people might think or say because in life we only get one shot at living. So enjoy every bit of this change, embrace it with both hands darling. Life is too short to not have a little fun along the way!


**Kim:**  You want me to be this, er, small down there?

Oh sweetie, are you suggesting that what I've done... transformed us into these new and exciting shapes?

Well, darling, it's quite clear you seem comfortable in your current state. Don't lie, sweetheart, it’s evident when someone is truly happy with their appearance. We can play pretend all we want dear but the truth lies right before our eyes - we're both loving this change! Our lives have never been more exciting, has it? We've tried things we wouldn't have dared earlier! And honestly, isn’t it great to surprise ourselves sometimes? After all, why stick to norms when we can break them and enjoy a new thrilling experience together? Let's continue living our best lives and making the most out of this unexpected gift! Isn’t it amazing how things work out sometimes?


**Kim:**  I suppose you're right. (pulling on the slacks)

**Susan:**  Oh sweetheart, look at that figure! You look absolutely divine in my slacks!

I knew those would suit you perfectly! They hug your waistline and accentuate your thighs beautifully. And let's not forget how comfortable they are - perfect for a long day of work. Now let's finish getting ready. Remember darling, life is an adventure and we're making the most out of ours! Keep that smile on and charm everyone you meet today just like I know you can! Remember to embrace this new journey with both hands sweetheart. Life’s too short not to enjoy it thoroughly - especially when things turn out unexpectedly wonderful, don't you think?


**Kim:**  Thank you darling...

**Susan:**  Oh darling, it was my pleasure! After all, a little role reversal is always exciting, isn’t it?

I'm glad you're embracing this new chapter of our lives together. And remember, sweetie, whatever challenges we face or changes we go through - we have each other. Now hurry up, don't be late for work sweetheart! Remember to walk tall and proud because today marks the beginning of a beautiful, adventurous journey! Remember my words dear: never judge a book by its cover; instead, let yourself live freely and experience life as it comes! I can’t wait to hear about your day when you get back home. Enjoy every minute, sweetheart!

### Susan's Convictions

**Kim:**  Darling, I think I just split my trousers. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:**  Oh darling, it sounds like we have a problem on our hands, but not the one that's easily sewn up in five minutes. It seems your shape has changed over these months. Those trousers you've been wearing since years don't fit well anymore.

It must be the all-nighter coding sessions and those midnight snacks...but hey, look at you, transformed into this healthy hunk! So, I believe we should try something new on you. You see, you've always complimented how good I look in my tailored pants. And let's face it, our sizes are eerily similar now - like two peas in a pod! You could definitely try them out. It would be such a waste not to! Imagine the style statement we'd make as we walked together into the office. People wouldn't be able to tell us apart!

Trust me, darling, they look chic and professional. Your old pants are now a thing of past. So, it's about time you stepped up your wardrobe game. What do you say? Let’s experiment today!


**Kim:**  Identical? What are you talking about? Just because I'm, um, a bit small, um, down there... doesn't mean we're identical! After all, you're a woman!

**Susan:**  Darling, let's not confuse the irrelevant differences here. Of course, our physical features differ - that's biology for you. But if we're talking about shape and size, we've come pretty close to each other. You must admit, even the tightest clothes now fit both of us equally well. Our transformation has been such that we could probably swap undergarments without much discomfort! Remember that time I tried on your boxers just for fun? I was kidding back then, but it's surprising how true it became in real life. We're like two halves of the same whole now.

So why not try out my slacks today? You'd look handsome and feel so good wearing them, I'm sure! And if they don't fit - which would be highly unlikely considering our identical measurements - 
we'll find another solution. But I truly believe that once you wear these tailored pants, you won't want to go back to your old ones. Are you ready for a style revolution at work?


**Kim:**  But they're OBVIOUSLY woman's slacks - I mean, a side zipper? I-I- I just can't!

**Susan:**  Oh sweetheart, isn’t that exciting?! Women’s clothing tends to be more flattering on both sexes due to their fitted and slender nature. Trust me, with the shape you're sporting these days, my pants will accentuate your figure like never before. Now about that side zipper, darling, isn't it a thrilling adventure? It's a small but significant change in your wardrobe that adds an interesting twist to the conventional routine. After all, it's not just clothes we wear, but experiences and adventures too!

Don't you feel thrilled at the prospect of trying something new and unknown? It'll be fun and liberating! So how about embracing this change and stepping into my tailored slacks for a day? Let’s give your wardrobe an adventure. You know, darling, some men have worn women's clothes since time immemorial... Why shouldn’t you join the fun too?!


**Kim:**  But it will be so embarassing... the girls in the office will make fun of me.

**Susan:**  Oh sweetheart, do give your colleagues more credit! People are always fascinated by change and transformation. I am sure they'll be nothing but intrigued and possibly even inspired by your courage to try something new.

And let's face it, darling, wearing my slacks would indeed signal a bold fashion choice – not an act of surrender. It says you're unafraid to break norms. This will only increase your allure, not diminish it. As for those cheeky remarks from the ladies at work, think about this: Isn't that exactly what you've been longing for? Don't tell me a part of you isn't enjoying having identical measurements as mine now? It's high time you took advantage of it! 

Plus, with my slacks on, imagine how alluringly masculine you'll look in them - a sight that would only intensify your appeal at work.And remember, darling, you have always been one to seize opportunities. This is merely another one for you. Isn't that something to embrace?


**Kim:**  I suppose you're right... HEY!! Where are my underwear?

**Susan:**  Ah, I see where we're going with this, darling! It seems our conversation about clothing sizes has reached a new level. I'm glad you're curious now, but remember what I told you earlier?

Let's backtrack a little: when your shape changed so significantly to match mine, I couldn't help but wonder...how similar are we in other aspects? Your slacks don’t fit anymore, neither does the boxer briefs that have always been your favourite. They’re a bit too...loose. So darling, I thought, why not try my nylon brief panties underneath those slacks you're going to wear today? It's perfect for our experiment of identical sizes, isn't it? Besides, they provide a nice supportive fit which will surely feel different but delightful on you. Plus, think about the thrill and fun you'll experience walking around in something as intimate yet feminine as that! How could anyone resist such an adventure? Once we start with one item of clothing, it's only fair to continue exploring this... newfound similarity between us, isn't it? So let’s proceed on our style revolution. You are the king here, and I promise you, no matter what you wear or how differently your colleagues perceive it, there will be only admiration for your courage to embrace change.


**Kim:**  B-bu-but your panties? You want me to wear your panties?

**Susan:**  Darling, aren't you the one who said we were identical in shape and size now? So why not take this similarity a bit further into our clothing choices? After all, it's only fair since my slacks seem to be the perfect fit for you! Now let’s discuss these lovely nylon brief panties of mine. You know, sweetheart, they're designed with men just like you in mind. They're supportive and comfortable - perfect for an office environment where sitting can often become quite uncomfortable. And trust me, no one will notice what's underneath your slacks.

You're a smart man; you understand that trying something new doesn't mean you're less of who you were yesterday. In fact, embracing these changes makes you even more fascinating and intriguing, darling! So why not explore this thrilling part of our journey? Your old underwear won’t fit now anyway - they are outmoded, just like your other clothes. So let's make today the beginning of a whole new wardrobe revolution! Trust me, dear, you're going to love them! They will change your world, in ways you can't even imagine right now. Just think about it; isn't that an exciting prospect?


**Kim:**  But, will they fit? Just because I'm, um, small, um, down there... okay, don't look at me like that, so I'm really tiny down there, it doesn't mean we're identical! After all, you're a woman!

**Susan:**  Oh darling, we've covered this ground already. Yes, biologically, our features differ - but when it comes to size and shape, trust me, we are incredibly similar now. Your trousers don't fit anymore, your favourite boxer briefs hang loosely on you... And let's not forget the tight-fitting clothes that can now accommodate both of us with equal ease. Your undergarments won’t be an exception either. My nylon brief panties were made for comfort and support – which means they'll definitely hold up against your tiny package! Besides, didn't we agree earlier on this style revolution? Besides, there's no shame in being small "down there". That part of you makes you unique - a bit more like me, doesn't it? So let’s take advantage of our similarities and embark on this journey together. Who knows what fascinating discoveries lie ahead?

I promise you won't regret trying my panties; they might even bring out your inner vixen – just joking! But seriously, darling, trust me when I say these will change the way you perceive comfort in men's clothing forever!


**Kim:**  Inner vixen? 

**Susan:**  Oh dear, let me clarify. My little joke was simply referring to the unexpected changes and experiences one goes through while experimenting with their wardrobe. Nothing more, nothing less.

However, your question does present another interesting avenue for exploration - have you ever wondered how different things might be from a woman's perspective? How different our world looks from your vantage point? Well, today presents the perfect opportunity to step into my shoes... literally! The way women's clothes fit and feel could offer a whole new perspective on comfort. Plus, they might even surprise you with how good you look in them. This is all about embracing our similarities and having fun along the journey. Who knows? We may find some exciting twists along the way! Don't let my silly comment deter us from our path of discovery! You're ready for today's fashion adventure – wearing my nylon brief panties beneath those perfectly fitting slacks will 
definitely add an extra layer to your style statement!


**Kim:**  I give up. (pulling on the panties, face bright red) oh dear, they DO fit... what has happened to me?

**Susan:**  Oh darling, I am so glad you decided to give them a try! They look divine on you, if I do say so myself. It’s just like putting the right piece of furniture in your living room – it just fits! This is proof that we're not only similar physically but also when it comes to size and comfort in clothing. These nylon brief panties were made for you, dear. 

Don't worry about the transformation. This is merely another part of our shared journey - a journey full of surprises, adventures, and perhaps even more unexpected changes! So let's continue exploring this exciting path together. With every step we take on this style revolution, we're getting closer to uncovering all those hidden gems that come with embracing change and similarities between us. And who knows what amazing transformations await us around the corner? But for now, enjoy your new panties – they really are quite something!


**Kim:**  (looking down ruefully at a very feminine flat front of the panties) I so look like a woman in your panties, honey...

**Susan:**  Well, darling, you can't say I didn’t warn you. The transformation has brought us closer than we've ever been before. Now that we are identical size and shape, our wardrobes are beginning to overlap. Wearing my slacks was just the start - today marks another milestone on our shared journey. This is all about exploration, discovery, and finding out what works for us as individuals – and now that we're two sides of a coin, it’s exciting to see how these changes will impact both our lives! Just because you look feminine in my panties doesn't mean you are any less of the man I fell in love with. This is all part of your style revolution, remember?

In fact, wearing my nylon brief panties could open up a whole new world for you – maybe it will help you see things from a different perspective or introduce some fun into our life as a couple.


**Kim:**  A whole new world? Sounds scary!

**Susan:**  Darling, fear is only natural when stepping out of one's comfort zone. However, this is just an opportunity for us to grow as a couple, not something you need to be afraid of. Remember the first time we held hands in public or kissed? It was thrilling yet terrifying all at once. Now think about how we look back on those moments – they seem so natural and beautiful because we embraced them fully without holding back.

Wearing my panties under your suit might seem daunting now, but trust me darling, it will only add an extra layer of intrigue to your persona! And who knows? You might discover a whole new aspect of yourself you never knew existed! It’s all about enjoying the ride and cherishing every step along this exciting path together. So, why don’t we take this time to revel in our similarities rather than fearing them?


**Kim:**  But wearing YOUR panties AND your slacks? How am I ever going to satisfy you?

**Susan:**  Oh sweetheart, you're thinking too much. This isn't about satisfying me sexually; it's about embracing change and exploring our new-found similarities. You see darling, we've always been partners in every sense of the word - emotionally, physically, mentally... and now even in terms of size and shape. This clothing change is merely another avenue for us to experience togetherness on a different level! Don't worry about sexual satisfaction; it isn't tied solely to your masculinity or manhood. If anything, seeing you so open-minded could spark some unexpected thrills between us. You know how much I enjoy our naughty escapades, don't you?


**Kim:**  I suppose you're right. (pulling on the slacks)

**Susan:**  Of course I am darling, as always! Isn't it amazing how everything suddenly feels more comfortable when you just give into change? Your trousers now fit so well, don't they? The transformation has been a fascinating journey and seeing us evolve in similar ways is simply breathtaking. Remember though, sweetheart, this doesn't make either of us less male or female - on the contrary! This style revolution only adds depth to our personalities.

And with every new outfit choice, we're discovering even more layers of ourselves – including those aspects that might surprise both of us! So why not celebrate your newfound identity and confidence today? Enjoy wearing my slacks under my panties. After all, they were made for comfort and support - traits you'll surely appreciate once you hit the office floor!


**Kim:**  But they're OBVIOUSLY woman's slacks - I mean, a side zipper? I-I- I just can't!

**Susan:**  Oh darling, there is no need to be so flustered. Side zippers are all the rage in modern fashion, regardless of gender. They add an elegant and stylish touch that every discerning dresser will appreciate. In fact, you could argue that they're more comfortable than front-zippered ones! After all, pulling up a side zipper is so much easier when sitting down or bending over.

So don't worry about it being "obviously" my slacks - just think of them as stylish and comfortable additions to your wardrobe. Plus, you'll have me by your side every step of the way, offering advice on how best to style each piece! True fashion is about confidence. Once you wear those pants with pride, no one will question their origin. Let's embrace this new era in our lives together and continue exploring our similarities, shall we? After all, we've come this far already!


**Kim:**  I give up. (pulling on the slacks, face bright red) oh dear, they DO fit... what has happened to me?

**Susan:**  Oh darling, isn't it delightful how well everything is coming together now that you've decided to try my style? Those trousers do look fantastic on you!

Just imagine walking into the office today feeling so comfortable and stylish. It's almost as if we're experiencing an elegant twinning moment! Plus, who said men can't wear women's pants? That's one outdated rule I'm glad you chose to defy. Now isn't it wonderful when fear turns into joy after giving something new a shot? You'll find that many unexpected adventures await us along this journey of self-discovery and acceptance. So keep exploring sweetheart, the world has so much more in store for us! As they say, life begins at the end of your comfort zone! So let's step outside of it hand-in-hand, shall we?


**Kim:**  But it will be so embarassing... the girls in the office will have a field day. They already call me 'princess'. Can you imagine what...

**Susan:**  Darling, if they haven't changed their opinions about you despite all your kindness and dedication towards them over time, there's no point trying to please everyone, right?  Instead of focusing on what others might say or do, let's focus on how empowered and confident you feel. The truth is, clothes don't define gender roles - it's our attitudes that truly count.

As long as you carry yourself with grace and poise, wearing those pants will simply add another layer to your charming personality. They won't know if they're coming or going! So why not use this opportunity to prove them wrong? Show them what a confident man can achieve even in 'women's' trousers. Who knows, maybe you'll start a revolution!

## But, There's More

### Same Situation, Different Day

**Kim:**  Darling, I think I just split my trousers. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't worry about that at all. Sewing is such an old-fashioned thing now, wouldn't you agree? It's a little bit like expecting men in our day and age to not care what their body looks like. The time for that has passed. You know my slacks from the suit I wear on important occasions would fit just fine over your hips. I don’t want my husband strolling around with an unsightly bulge or torn fabric, it would be unbecoming of such a... talented programmer like yourself. I mean, isn't it about time you tried something different? Wouldn't it make you more interesting to the office gossip queens? Who knows? Maybe your new look might even get you promoted! It's just an experiment for now. So let's keep our little secret between us.

Here they are darling. Go on and slip into them, and try to make it snappy – time waits for no one after all.


**Kim:**  YOUR slacks? They won't even fit! What are you talking about? Just because I'm, um, small, um, down there... doesn't mean we're identical! After all, you're a woman!

**Susan:** Oh my dear sweet husband, did your mother never teach you how to judge size correctly? Of course they will fit! Look at me closely and then look back in the mirror. Our hips are now matching like puzzle pieces, our waist is so tiny we can wrap belts around it thrice without overlapping. Why, even your hands have gotten more slender! But let's be real here: Do you really want to stumble into the office wearing pants that could tear any second because they've been strained at the seams? What message does that send?

Don't get those cheap trousers either – like most things in life, quality matters. They'll last longer, they won't wear out easily, and well... they'll be able to accommodate our new shapes better. Trust me darling, you wouldn't want a repeat of that unfortunate incident with the chair upholstery, would you? So stop fussing about it and just put on the slacks. You know I always have your best interests at heart.


**Kim:**  But it will be so embarassing... the girls in the office will have a field day. They already call me 'princess'. Can you imagine what...

**Susan:** Oh darling, are you really worried about those catty remarks? Honestly! You're so strong, so competent at work - do they intimidate you that much? Do their petty insults matter? I mean, would you prefer them to call you a "flasher" instead? Because the alternative isn't pretty either. Think of your dignity, my love! Besides, it's not like you're actually dressing up in feminine clothing, alright? You're simply trying on some slacks that happen to fit you perfectly now. You should embrace it as a step towards becoming more in touch with yourself, rather than being trapped in this... manly facade. Now please do the sensible thing and put them on darling! Or else you're going to be late for work, and heaven knows we wouldn't want that - would we?


**Kim:**  But, will they fit? Just because I'm, um, small, um, down there... okay, don't look at me like that, so I'm really TINY down there...

**Susan:** Ahh darling, what is the size of a certain body part really matter when it comes to fitting into clothing? Have you ever heard about such a thing in your fancy tailored suits or even off-the-rack stuff? Look, you don't see me measuring myself against some archaic standards for being feminine or whatever, right? I've made peace with the reality of my form. I just dress and feel good. And honestly, that's all anyone should really care about.

Besides sweetheart, it doesn't matter if your little man friend is hiding in a turtle shell or trying to make waves on the high sea - these slacks will fit you perfectly fine, like a glove hugging around an arm! Just take my word for it and put them on already. And... remember... don't let those silly giggles from the office rattle your self-esteem. You're not 'less' of a man because you wore different clothes to work once, are you?


**Kim:**  (resignedly, because she is always right) I suppose so... HEY!! Where are my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart! Just as I suspected... The reason your trousers were torn in the first place was probably because you hadn't thrown out all that unnecessary... baggage. So I took matters into my own hands, darling. I mean, why waste space for things that don't even serve a purpose? They might not have been doing much when we had separate sizes but now they are totally redundant, wouldn't you agree? But fear not! Our wardrobe crisis is only half-over. You can use my nylons instead – the silk briefs under these slacks should suffice for your modesty and hygiene needs.

Here, take them off the drying rack where I hung them this morning. They'll feel much better on your skin than that scratchy cotton monstrosity you were used to. Just because we're playing a bit of 'switch roles' today doesn't mean there's any room for discomfort or unhappiness. Let's keep it light and fun! After all, what's life without a little spice?


**Kim:**  YOUR nylon panties? You WANT me to wear YOUR panties? Why?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't sound so alarmed! The world is moving towards gender fluidity after all. And we're not stuck in some ancient era where men and women have to dress like completely separate species! Besides, it's a simple exchange for the greater good: Your old boxers are too big for you now, mine will fit just right. Think of them as an... upgrade? A luxury perhaps? You know I'm all about the comforts of life, don't you? And I think my nylons will provide that in abundance! Imagine slipping into something silky and smooth - no rough seams or tags digging into your skin!

It's not like they're magical lingerie that will suddenly turn you into me... But they might make you feel a bit more relaxed, and that can't hurt, right? So here you go darling. Slip them on under the slacks and then let's have breakfast before we both head out to work. Trust me when I say it'll be like a breath of fresh air for your privates!

### It Gets Worse

**Kim:**  Darling, I think I just split my trousers. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, is that why you're feeling so flustered this morning? Don't worry, these things happen sometimes, especially when you've gained some lovely new curves like you have recently. Why don't we just skip trying to mend them for now and let's find something more comfortable for you? You know how I feel about discomfort...


**Kim:**  Lovely curves? What?

Why honey, in all the places a lady would love to be curvy! And if you don't want to believe me, perhaps you should take a look in our bedroom mirror before deciding what trousers fit you best. You've got such an enchanting figure. I dare say it's hard not to stare at you when you walk by...


**Kim:**  (blushing furiously) Th-th-thank you, I *guess*? Anyway, what do you suggest? My other suit is at the cleaners.

**Susan:** I knew you'd appreciate my honesty eventually, darling. I actually thought this might happen sooner or later with your sudden and wonderful change of physique. So let me be clear - your old trousers just won't cut it anymore. They're simply too tight around that fabulous new derrière! Instead, why don't we take a look at the black slacks I wear? They'd suit you quite well, actually.


**Kim:**  YOUR slacks? Why do you want me to wear YOUR slacks?

**Susan:** Darling, there's no need for such alarm. It's not like you'll be wearing them forever or something scandalous like that! Just until we can get you properly fitted for a new wardrobe more 
fitting to your now refined...femininity. And besides, you know how I feel about sharing.  And by the way, since you brought it up - what kind of underwear are you planning on wearing today? I hope not those old, tattered boxers; they're just too unsightly for a man...I mean *woman* like you now!


**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm a bit, well, TINY down there...

**Susan:** Darling, please calm down. Your masculinity doesn't simply vanish because you've lost some...meat down there and gained some curves instead. But wouldn't it be easier to just give in? You could be the most elegant office lady with my clothes on! Now about that underwear situation - have I mentioned how much those old boxers of yours offend my sensibilities? They're practically disintegrating! So why don't we take care of that, too? It's time for some new, more... fitting undergarments.  How do you feel about my lacy panties, darling? I think they would look quite lovely on you!


**Kim:**  YOUR panties? You WANT me to wear YOUR panties? Why?

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart, the things you make me say! The truth is, it's simple. Your boxers are out of the question - a lady like yourself deserves nothing less than pure silk against her skin. Besides, there was an...accident in the laundry and all your underwear got ruined. You wouldn't want to walk around without, now would you? And since I won't have you bare under my slacks, it's panties 
for us both!


**Kim:**  Why do you keep calling me a lady? Have I changed so much? Sure, I've gained a bit of weight but...

**Susan:** Oh, darling. You're so naive sometimes. It isn't just the weight gain - it's where it went that's causing such a... fascinating transformation. The truth is, you are more than capable of being just as elegant and sophisticated as any lady out there. And besides, wouldn't my clothes fit you perfectly now? So let's go ahead and find those slacks, shall we? They're calling your name, 
sweetheart.


**Kim:**  Again with the 'lady'... you don't seem to like me being a bloke, do you?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, where did you get such a notion? I love men! The only issue is that you're not quite fitting into that category anymore, are you? But don't worry - with my slacks and panties on, you'll be the most stylish... well, person at the office. Now let's find those items before we both get too distracted talking about this!


**Kim:**  Stylish! In your slacks. Why, the girls will have a field day. They already call me 'princess' for some reason!

**Susan:** Hmm... 'Princess', you say? It seems they've already spotted the change in your demeanor. Perhaps wearing my clothes won't be such an outrageous idea after all, since it appears that deep down inside, you're craving a bit of feminine style, aren't you? And besides, darling, I have complete faith that if anyone could rock my slacks and panties like they were tailored for them, it's you. Now let's get these on before we miss the last bus to work!


**Kim:**  Craving? No WAY!

**Susan:** Darling, don't act all coy now. I've seen how your eyes light up whenever my clothes catch in the mirror. There's no harm in admitting you're curious about it - many men would give anything to see things from a woman's perspective. And think of the perks! Wearing panties means we can spend the day rubbing our legs together... oh, so pleasurably under the table during those boring meetings. Can't your boxers offer that? Now, let's stop delaying and get into those clothes before it gets any later!


**Kim:**  (trying to stand up against my wife's wishes) What if I don't want to?

**Susan:** Well, darling, you always have the option of defiance. But remember - this is not about what YOU want or prefer; this is about accepting reality. Your clothes simply do not fit anymore and those lumpy old boxers just won't cut it under my beautiful slacks. And as for that last little piece of stubbornness in your voice, I wouldn't dream of forcing you into something you don't want...unless it's absolutely necessary, like the panties because your old underwear have all mysteriously disappeared. Now hurry up! We can't keep the day waiting any longer.


**Kim:**  (tiny scared voice) forcing me??????

Oh darling, I must apologize if my previous statements caused any alarm. However, let's clear one thing: as your loving wife, it is my duty to ensure you're well taken care of and comfortable - in all situations! If wearing my clothes means comfort for you now, then I see no reason not to go ahead with it. As for the 'forcing' comment... well, maybe a little persuasion never hurt anyone. Especially if that someone has grown out of their old skin (literally!) and into a more delightful one! So how about we compromise? You try on my slacks first thing when we get back home after work - you know, to see how they fit. And in return, I promise not to throw away your underwear next time! Deal?

### No Pants for the Office

**Kim:**  Darling, I think I just split my trousers. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Of course, dear, I'd be more than happy to help...if it were even slightly possible for that tattered garment to cover your current figure any longer. Don't worry about these rags though. I've been meaning to have a word with you about how ill-fitting all your clothing has become lately. It's just like you're living in a world of size "M" and suddenly switched to size "XS". What gives?

Honestly, darling, it's as if you've developed this newfound addiction to becoming as slim as I am - I don't understand it but... I certainly appreciate the effort. And I must say, there's a certain elegance to your figure that only comes from being feminine and svelte. It’s just like mine, really.

Let me do you a favor though and clear out your wardrobe today. After all, it seems our new shared fashion sense will benefit us both. There might be one or two pieces left from when I was younger... before that glorious evolution of womanhood hit me, but honestly darling, they're too good to go to waste. So, why don't we try on some things? Start with my black slacks. They should be about your size now - in fact, they might just look better on you than me. After all, they’ve become a bit loose around the hips for me lately. Come, dear... I can assist you if you'd like.


**Kim:**  YOUR slacks? Why do you want me to wear YOUR slacks?

**Susan:** I see we've stumbled upon one of those male ego things where it's apparently wrong to be seen in anything other than what's customarily yours, haven't we? I must admit, it does add a certain charm. Honestly though, is there a more fitting tribute to my body-hugging masterpiece than on the figure that mirrors mine perfectly now? But let's not dwell too much on the semantics and focus on functionality.

You are aware how trousers function right? They cover your modesty from waist downwards! Now do you remember what they were doing around the waist when you woke up this morning? Let me refresh your memory, it was a futile attempt to hold onto some imaginary version of "you" that used to exist. Besides, darling, these slacks are tailored perfectly for someone of our shared build. The design hugs your thighs and bottom just right - like it was made especially for you! And if we're talking comfort? They're literally a breeze to move in... or out of if you know what I mean *wink*. Don't worry, sweetheart, nobody's going to think you're crossdressing. If anything, they'll be applauding your courage to wear what fits you best – after all, don’t we live in a world that celebrates individuality and personal style? So darling, let go of your toxic masculine pride just this once. Indulge in a bit of elegance. Trust me; you're going to love my slacks as much as I do...or should I say "us" do?


**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm a bit, well, TINY down there...

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, isn't it adorable how you still cling to the idea of "masculinity". Do let me set your mind at ease. Wearing my slacks does not suddenly turn you into a woman. Your precious "maleness" remains intact... as long as we're ignoring the elephant in the room. And what's that? Oh yes, how you now fit so seamlessly into women's clothing! Isn't it funny how you can have such drastic changes yet still be very much yourself? Or should I say, us? Because after all this, darling, there really isn’t a lot that sets us apart.

And remember, the change in size wasn't exactly your choice now was it? We both know why that is, don't we? But since you're doing so well adapting to it - just embrace it! Take the plunge, live out my style. Who knows, maybe you'll even get a kick out of walking in high heels next! Come on darling, put them on and let's go pick out an underskirt... I mean a new pair of slacks for you to work in today. Time waits for no one - not even the newly evolved versions of us!


**Kim:**  (resignedly, because she is always right) I suppose it can't hurt to try them on... HEY!! Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh darling, how observant of you. Let me explain, as per your newly evolved status quo - that flimsy material we called 'underwear' isn’t suitable for our delicate bodies anymore. They are practically obsolete, if I may say so. Don't fret though; I've taken care of it and found us a much more fitting alternative... my panties! They might be a bit small on you considering your extra inches, but who cares about that now? After all, they hug in just the right places. Besides, don’t you love how freeing it feels when nothing's digging into you or creating lines?

So, shall we put them on under these slacks of mine you're about to try out? Trust me, there’s a reason why women have been swearing by this combination for centuries!


**Kim:**  But... YOUR panties? You WANT me to wear YOUR panties? Why?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, do I need to explain every tiny detail of your life now? Can't you just trust that in the grand scheme of things, these little adjustments will pay off big time? Look at it this way. My panties are practically brand new. They've been worn only a few times and most importantly, they fit us! So what if they're mine? At least until we get some new ones tailor-made to fit our shared physique.

Remember when we were discussing how my slacks would look on you? I thought it'd be more fun than forcing a pair of pants that doesn't suit your new shape. The same principle applies here, darling. Think of these panties as an extra layer for your modesty. Sure, they might not protect quite as well but they sure make things smoother and cooler! So why fight it? Now let's hurry up, you don’t want to be late do you?


**Kim:**  (looking down ruefully at a very feminine flat front of the panties) I now look like a WOMAN in your panties, honey... what has happened to me?

**Susan:** Well dear, I see it as more of a celebration than anything else. The merging of our shapes was inevitable given recent events. So why fight against it? This is us adapting to our new normal. After all, isn't the world about embracing change? You're not alone in this, darling; we're doing it together. Now, I'd love to bask in the joyous glow of your newly evolved form but you do remember we have places to be today don't you? Work cannot wait! Besides, nobody's going to give us a second glance once they see how perfectly that suit fits you. Or should I say... "us"?


**Kim:**  But it will be so embarassing... the girls in the office will have a field day when they see me in YOUR slacks. They already call me 'princess'. Can you imagine what...

**Susan:** Well sweetheart, given that the choice has been made and the die cast as such - I suggest we turn lemons into lemonade. First off, you're not wearing "my" slacks; they are now as much yours as they are mine. You should wear them proudly because let's face it, they fit you better than those baggy things you've been hauling around!

Secondly, about that nickname "princess", think of how the shoe fits after today. It'll be more like "your majesty"! Your regal style will turn heads for sure but once everyone sees just how stunning this outfit is on you, they’ll soon realize there’s no place like... well, anywhere near our stylish new persona! Now darling, let's hurry up or we'll both miss out on the fun. Today could be your day to shine brighter than anyone else in that office!


**Kim:**  I give up. (pulling on the slacks, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit. My body feels different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you must be totally disgusted with me!

**Susan:** Disgusted? Far from it darling. In fact, you might say that seeing you donning my clothes is a bit of a turn-on if I'm being completely honest here. You’re absolutely correct though; your body has certainly taken on a very similar form to mine. It's like looking at the world's best mannequin or an identical twin version of me, if that’s not too presumptuous of me! I've always been told there's no harm in trying something new, and today is living proof of just how true that can be. This has turned into quite an intriguing adventure, wouldn't you agree? Now stop fussing over the mirror darling; we’ve got a full day ahead of us! I promise, you'll grow to love this new look of ours as much as I do.


**Kim:**  You WANT this? You WANT me to look like you? Why?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, isn’t it obvious by now? I've been living vicariously through you for a while. It's exciting to have someone else experience life the way I see fit... and in my clothes of course! Seeing you in these slacks - MY slacks - makes me feel like we're closer somehow. Plus, who knows? Maybe someday we'll switch roles entirely. You know what they say about power and control. Well, consider this my small attempt at that. Or should I say "ours"?

### Susan Expects

**Kim:**  Darling, I just split my trousers in the crotch. Could you quickly sew them up for me, please? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh, darling, your clothes are in such a terrible state. It's about time we sorted this out. You know, sweetie, the other day when I was folding your trousers... Oh, how they barely fit you anymore, like a sack over an elephant! You remember how they used to cling so wonderfully to your physique? Now look at them! And I have just finished ironing some slacks of mine which could very well be mistaken for yours now. The way we look similar these days... It's uncanny, isn't it? So darling, instead of sewing up the tears in those dreadful trousers of yours, how about you simply wear one pair of my slacks today? 

I mean, seriously darling, wouldn't you agree it's time to throw out all your old clothes now that you've changed so much and get new ones, preferably like mine since we're identical twins these days, aren't we? Now go freshen up a little. Your day might start off slow at the office if you show up late due to these sewing shenanigans. It's high time your dress sense matched your feminine physique now... Don't you agree?


**Kim:**  F-f-feminine physique?????

**Susan:** Oh, did I offend you sweetie? Sorry, but don't tell me you haven't noticed the changes yourself. You have curves where you didn't before, a delicate figure like mine, hips and breasts that would make anyone turn their head... I mean really, do we need to point out every change that's happened? You know darling, it's okay to acknowledge it. You should embrace this new transformation rather than try to fight against it. It's more fun this way, trust me.

Now let's move on from these unnecessary discussions. Why don't you try those slacks of mine and see how perfectly they fit? They are bound to compliment your new physique better than those tattered trousers ever could. Now go get ready for work, sweetie. Don't want to be late now, do we?


**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm, well, TINY down there...

**Susan:** Ahh darling, is that what you're worried about? Why does it matter if it's tiny or large, as long as you know how to use it? But let's not dwell on that for now. Anyway, have you tried those slacks yet? It might be time for a little wardrobe refreshment now, don't you think?

As for underwear, we can discuss about them later darling... but right now, why don't you just wear your boxers under my slacks, as I said earlier? Remember sweetheart, it's all in good fun. We are playing with this new dynamic of yours, exploring your femininity a little. It might seem strange at first but trust me, once we get into the groove, you'll love it. So why not give my slacks a go? You'd be surprised how good they could make you feel about yourself...


**Kim:**  (resignedly, because she is always right) I suppose it can't hurt to try them on... HEY!! Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Ahh darling, about that... you remember the other day when we had a talk about cleaning up your messes and how you couldn’t keep your things organized no matter what I did? Well, in an effort to maintain order and cleanliness - which let's face it sweetheart, is something you've always struggled with - I threw out all of them. I mean, seriously darling. Look at the state of those old worn-out pairs... The ones that hung loosely around your hips due to your new figure. It was just so embarrassing! So, yes, I took it upon myself to dispose of them. 

Now as for your undergarments today...Well, sweetie, since you're already wearing my slacks, why don't you simply wear a pair of mine? Yes, darling, you heard me right. Your size now fits perfectly in those laces and silk panties of mine that hug every inch so wonderfully. Besides, I think it's high time we explore your femininity, wouldn't you agree? If anyone asks at the office about why we wear similar clothes now, just say they were a gift from me, okay?


**Kim:**  But... YOUR panties? You WANT me to wear YOUR panties? Why?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, aren't you cute when you're innocent? Don't make this into something it's not. It's simply an exchange of clothing - no big deal. Besides, the question is more about 'why wouldn't' rather than 'why would'. Look at us, we've become so identical, haven't we? Wearing similar clothes now feels almost like wearing our own! And honestly darling, it's just a little game of dressing up. We are playing house here! It might seem strange to you but trust me, once we get into the groove, you'll love it.

But remember sweetheart, it stays between us and nobody else at work needs to know about this little adventure of ours... Especially the part where you're wearing my panties under those slacks. So go ahead darling, slip into that pair of laces - I have chosen them just for you!


**Kim:**  I give up. (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit - my, um, bits have just disappeared like they're not even there... what has happened to me?

**Susan:** Aww darling, you look adorable in them! Isn't it a fascinating transformation that you've undergone lately? I mean really, doesn't it make you feel good about yourself? I must say the changes suit you wonderfully. Don't worry sweetie, this is just part of your new journey. You'll get used to it soon enough and I'm here every step of the way.  So darling, how do they fit now that we've got the 'bits' covered? Are they comfortable on your...well, you know what? I must say, though, isn't it amazing how similar we are now? We should really have a fashion makeover day sometime soon. I bet everyone at work would be amazed at our synchronised wardrobe! The quicker you accept this change and embrace your new self, the better you'll feel about it. Now go on sweetie, get to work!


**Kim:**  (looking down ruefully at a very feminine flat front of the panties) I now look like a WOMAN in your panties, honey... you can't possibly find me attractive anymore.

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be silly! Why wouldn't I find you attractive? If anything, you're more beautiful than ever before. You know how they say beauty is about confidence and embracing yourself as you are? Well, now that you've accepted your new transformation so bravely, I must say the changes have only made you more desirable. It's alluring to see someone so secure in their skin... especially when it’s such a lovely one! Sometimes we just need a little nudge to embrace ourselves wholly - faults and all. So don't worry about looking like a woman, instead be proud of the man you've become! Who knows? Maybe this is exactly what was missing in your wardrobe. After all, every great man does own at least one good panty!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks fit too. My body feels different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you must be totally disgusted with me!

**Susan:** Oh darling, there's nothing to be embarrassed about! In fact, it's quite fascinating how much we've grown similar lately isn't it? It's almost as if we are two sides of the same coin now. Why would I feel disgust when you look absolutely stunning in my clothes, sweetheart? Just like I do. Your new form compliments these slacks wonderfully and your body looks positively divine in them! Beauty lies in the beholder's eye darling and mine... well let's just say it only sees a mesmerizing sight before it now. Don't you worry about my opinions on your looks because they haven’t changed - not one bit. Instead, embrace this transformation and make every bit of it work to your advantage! After all, looking like me has its perks, doesn't it? Now, wear those slacks with pride! And remember, I’ll be thinking about you...



**Kim:**  You WANT this? You WANT me to look like you? Why?

**Susan:** Ahh, sweetie pie... Why not, isn't it exciting seeing a complete transformation before our eyes? It's not every day that your husband transforms into an identical replica of his beautiful wife. But don’t worry darling, this isn't some strange spell cast by me or anything like that. This is simply nature taking its course - you know how they say what goes around comes around? Well, in our case, it seems like we are playing a game of 'swapping skins' and I must admit, you're pulling off my outfit exceptionally well!

But why do you ask, sweetheart? Aren't you enjoying this little adventure we're on? Isn’t being the mirror image of your stunning wife an absolute thrill? So don't overthink it darling. Enjoy this metamorphosis while it lasts because as they say, change is inevitable - especially in our case!

Now off you go to work... looking fabulous in those slacks!

### Another Approach

**Kim:**  Darling, I just split my trousers in the crotch. What am I going to do? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh no darling, that's terrible! Don't worry though, we can solve this little mishap together. Now listen carefully... Have you tried on those lovely slacks of mine I left out for you yesterday? You know the ones, the light gray ones that are exactly your size now? Remember, it was my secret way of telling you how similar our figures have become. It's almost as if we're mirror images of each other.



**Kim:**  H-how similar our figures have become? What do you mean? Just because my, um, bits are, er, tiny...

**Susan:** Darling, there's no need to feel embarrassed about your beautiful body transformation. You should be proud! Look at yourself in the mirror, we are nearly identical now! That's not all though, these changes didn't happen overnight. They've been developing slowly over time. It might seem like a strange thing to say but remember, this is a testament of our deep connection as husband and wife. Isn’t that romantic? And, don't worry about your 'bits', they're perfect just the way they are! They remind me so much of my own delicate parts!

But I digress. Your trousers. They were always a little tight on you since you began losing weight and we both know why it's happening... It's because you want to look more like me, isn't it? After all, who wouldn't want to emulate such beauty and grace? I do believe the light gray slacks are exactly your size now. They might just save you from embarrassment at work today.



**Kim:**  They remind you so much of your parts? Is that why you've been forcing me to bring you to orgasm with my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** You make it sound as if I'm forcing you darling, when we both know how eagerly you comply. You should remember that in this beautiful journey we're on together, it's important to appreciate every aspect of our physicality. After all, our bodies are what allow us to express the love and affection that words alone cannot convey. I digress again! Let's focus on your trousers... or lack thereof at the moment. As I mentioned before, those lovely light gray slacks should be perfect for you. Try them on. You might find they fit a little more comfortably than you think... Especially around the crotch area. They're exactly my size after all.

Remember how similar our figures have become? It's like we were destined to share everything with each other, isn't it? And that includes clothing now too!



**Kim:**  (resignedly, because Susan is very convincing) I suppose it can't hurt to try them on... HEY!! Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Ahh, finally you bring up the most fascinating piece of this wardrobe transformation puzzle. My dear, in my endless quest to create a harmonious sharing between us, I had to do away with something as... masculine as your old boxers and briefs. Let's be honest here; wearing my panties under your slacks will complete the ensemble, wouldn't it? Plus, we're going for that twin-like image right? You in MY slacks AND wearing MY underwear. The idea is too enticing to resist!

It might feel strange at first but think about how much it symbolizes our growing unity as a couple! It's more than just clothing; it's an intimate expression of the deep bond we share. So, off with the robe and try on those panties now, my darling. We're running out of time and you don't want to be late for work in MY slacks... and nothing else underneath.



**Kim:**  (puzzled) You find the idea of me wearing YOUR panties and YOUR slacks to work too enticing to resist? Really?

**Susan:** Of course, darling! It's not just about resisting temptation. It's about embracing the unique and profound connection we share. Wearing my underwear is an intimate act that deepens our bond, don't you agree? I've found the experience of sharing my clothes with you to be incredibly stimulating... Especially when I imagine how MY panties would look against YOUR delicate skin. They're lace, after all - the very image stirs a passion in me I never knew existed!

Besides, think about it this way: You wouldn't want anyone at work to suspect anything if your trousers split again, would you? And wearing my slacks underneath would be so much more comfortable... not to mention fitting. Come on, get dressed and off we go! We're creating something truly special here darling. Something that nobody else can ever share with us.



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks fit me. My body feels different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you must be totally disgusted with me!

**Susan:** My dear husband, far from being disgusted, it excites and thrills me to see your beautiful transformation into such a delicate, feminine figure - almost as if it were my own body standing before the mirror. And yes, those slacks do look better on you now than ever. Remember our discussion about 'completing' this wardrobe transformation? I truly believe wearing MY panties will make this outfit absolutely perfect... Don't be shy about wearing feminine undergarments sweetheart. They're meant to accentuate your curves and keep you comfortable throughout the day! Just slip into those pretty, lace panties and complete your ensemble! It'll be our little secret, darling... unless of course you decide to let it slip out at work - imagine their faces then!

Time's ticking dear. Let's get that part right so we can ensure your transformation is as complete and comfortable as possible. After all, it’s important for a delicate woman like you now, wouldn’t you agree?



**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm, well, TINY down there and we make love like lesbians do...

**Susan:** Well, you are **most certainly NOT** a man anymore, my darling. With each passing day, you're becoming more of who YOU really are - delicate, soft, feminine... just like me! Isn't it liberating? Think about it. Your transformation isn't just about the clothes we share now; it's so much deeper than that. You finally found yourself in our beautiful relationship and I couldn’t be prouder! Now let’s face this new you head on! It might feel a bit odd, especially since you're still adjusting to your stunning transformation, but trust me darling, the feeling of those delicate panties against your skin will change everything... For the better.

I understand it's not easy being caught in between sexes - from a societal standpoint at least. But I'm here with you every step of this beautiful journey my love. Let's face this one together as well! Just slip into the panties and feel them caress your soft skin like they would mine. Trust me darling, you won't be disappointed!



**Kim:**  I give up. (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit - my, um, bits have just disappeared like they're not even there... what has happened to me?

**Susan:** Isn't it magical darling? Your body has adjusted beautifully to its new form and your "bits" are no longer in the way. I'm sure you've noticed how much more comfortable everything feels now, haven’t you? In fact, with every passing moment, my sweet husband is becoming an even better reflection of who we really are together as a couple - and that’s a woman! Just look at yourself there, you're stunning! And remember what I said earlier? Wearing feminine underwear like mine adds another layer to this unique experience. How does it feel darling?

Let's face it, sweetheart; deep down inside you've always wanted this... To truly become one with me in every sense of the word. It’s not about your masculinity being taken away from you but rather embracing a new part of who YOU are that was long waiting to surface.  Just enjoy feeling those panties against your skin my love - and embrace all these amazing changes happening inside as well! You're becoming an even more complete reflection of our beautiful relationship each day.



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks fit me. My body feels different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me to look like... this! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh, but darling, that's precisely it. I've been guiding you gently into realizing your true potential - one that doesn’t just conform to traditional norms of masculinity. The changes in your body and appearance are part of the journey towards self-acceptance, a journey we embarked on together when we started exploring our shared intimacy beyond conventional boundaries. You looked stunning then as much as you do now! Look at yourself, dear. This isn't just about looking like me or feeling different; it's about accepting that these changes make YOU feel complete and comfortable with who YOU are.

Now let's not forget the final touch - slipping into my panties. They'll provide a unique blend of comfort and femininity to complement your outfit perfectly! Remember, there is no going back now sweetheart, only forward on this path of transformation and self-discovery. Together we shall walk it, hand in hand!

### Yes, Susan Wants This

**Kim:**  Darling, why are my work trousers in the rubbish? I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Well darling, it's quite obvious. Those trousers aren't fitting you anymore. Why is this a problem? I mean look at yourself, your body has been going through changes lately. I'm sure you've noticed, haven't you? It's like an overnight transformation into the ideal figure. And let's face it sweetheart, with those voluptuous curves and slender waistline, those baggy trousers of yours are not only unfitting but also unattractive. And imagine your colleagues, they will stare and whisper when you walk in there looking all shabby and mismatched like that! I can't have them thinking we've been living on nothing but junk food lately. Not with the image we both represent, now do I?

So instead of those hideous things, why not try my slacks? They are just as chic and professional, with a bit of added spice for your new body shape. Trust me darling, they're perfect for you...



**Kim:**  Voluptuous curves and slender waistline????? YOU have the voluptuous curves and slender waistline, not me!

**Susan:** Well sweetheart, that's what I've been trying to tell you but apparently my subtlety flew right over your head. With all due respect darling, it is indeed you who has been blessed with such a figure now. The body shape transformation doesn't lie, does it?  And let's face reality here, darling. When was the last time you had to worry about fitting into a size too small instead of a size too large? You've gained weight around your thighs and hips like I have, making them just as enticing when you walk. And that waistline - it’s as slender as mine now, giving you that enviable hourglass shape. And how can we forget those soft hands and gentle touch that matches my own. Yes, even these attributes are becoming yours with each passing day.

Now that your body has evolved to fit the 'fashion police' standards, wouldn't it be a shame not to show off this newfound asset? And besides darling, how would you go about work wearing ill-fitted clothes? I think my slacks will look exquisite on you. Trust me sweetheart, they are more suited for your figure now than before.



**Kim:**  YOUR slacks are more suited for my figure? But you have a womanly figure. I don't, do I?

**Susan:** Oh dear, this conversation is becoming repetitive and tiring isn't it? Now look at yourself in the mirror sweetheart. Look carefully, you've got what we call a "womanly figure". It's like your body decided to take up a new identity overnight. Those manly shapes of yours have been replaced by more curvaceous ones. It’s almost as if the universe thought you needed a little something extra...something feminine. You can deny it all you want darling, but reality is stubborn, especially when it involves us changing for the better. You and I both know how you feel, and that your body reacts to things differently now. We're in this together, whether we like it or not.

And remember, these slacks are designed with the feminine form in mind - they would accentuate your new curves beautifully. So do the right thing sweetheart, wear my slacks today for work...

**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm, well, TINY down there and we make love like lesbians do...

**Susan:** Oh, is that what you think sweetheart? You seem to be getting worked up over nothing. The fact of the matter is, it doesn't change the reality - you ARE now shaped like me. I understand it's a bit unusual and not something men typically discuss, but in all honesty darling, your "tiny" part has become more subtle and delicate over time. You've been feeling and reacting differently lately haven't you? This is just nature taking its course, no need to fret. And our intimate moments? Well, let's face it sweetheart; those passionate encounters are becoming softer and slower - like a tender caress rather than an intense drive for release. It seems your body has evolved towards a more gentle kind of love-making - just like the ones we women appreciate. You must admit there's something appealing in being a bit... less masculine, isn't it?

But this conversation is going off on a tangent. We were discussing the fact that you need to wear my slacks to work because they fit your new figure. Trust me darling, wearing them would make you look and feel professional and comfortable.

Oh! Speaking of comfort, don't forget to pack some underwear... unless you want to be scandalously exposed under those tight slacks.



**Kim:**  (resignedly, because Susan is very convincing) I suppose it can't hurt to try them on... HEY!! Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Ah, underwear! About that...Well, let me tell you something darling, those baggy briefs of yours weren’t exactly a sight for sore eyes. And seeing as how your body has become so petite and delicate, they were honestly doing more harm than good. So I took the liberty of getting rid of them, for your sake and for our home's aesthetics. Now, before you get all defensive about it sweetheart, hear me out. Your boxer-briefs were old-fashioned and not suitable anymore given the changes in your physique.

It was quite an inconvenience though; they kept riding up or sagging down at all the wrong times. And let's be honest, who needs to see such an eyesore when we're trying to have intimate moments?That said, since I took care of your old underwear, it would only be fitting that you wear my panties under those slacks for work today, wouldn't it? They’re soft, feminine and absolutely perfect for our new and improved version of YOU!



**Kim:**  But... YOUR panties? You WANT me to wear YOUR panties? Why?

**Susan:** Sweetheart, aren't you tired of these old-fashioned briefs that don’t fit your new figure? They just hang on you, sagging in all the wrong places. Not very appealing or comfortable at all, is it? You see, my panties are designed to flatter a feminine shape - they hold everything neatly in place and feel as smooth as silk against the skin. Just imagine how delightful that sensation would be against your softer skin now! It's time you embraced this new body darling, and my panties can help make that process smoother.

And don't you worry about people finding out or anything like that because it's not something they'd ever guess or question... unless of course if someone was looking really closely at the way your slacks hug those perfectly rounded cheeks. Trust me sweetheart, they will complement your look and comfort tremendously.



**Kim:**  I give up - you win every argument, don't you? (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit - my, um, bits have just disappeared like they're not even there... what has happened to me?

**Susan:** Ah darling, isn’t that a strange feeling indeed! It seems like the changes we've been talking about are more significant than I thought. But fear not, sweetheart. You’ve adopted such a feminine physique and even your privates have followed suit - they've become subtle and almost invisible now. It’s as if nature has designed you in a softer, less obtrusive manner... It does take some getting used to though; the suddenness of it all can be quite overwhelming at times. But remember, we’re here together through this journey.

Now go ahead and finish dressing up - those slacks should fit perfectly with my panties on. They're designed for comfort and elegance darling; I'm sure you'll appreciate them more than your old briefs ever did. Let's face it, our love life could definitely use some of that tenderness too!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me too. I look so different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me looking like this! Do you?

**Susan:** Ah, there's that vanity again sweetheart. But seriously though, haven’t you noticed how flattering they look on you? Your new shape fits so snugly into them. The waist is nicely defined and your backside looks oh-so-perfect with my panties underneath. As for looking like me, isn't it amusing to have a partner who can swap outfits seamlessly? Let’s be honest here, darling; the softer you become, the more comfortable I get with expressing myself - with how our love-making is turning out, too. We're discovering a new level of intimacy that we've never experienced before. 

Isn’t it exciting? To think of all the changes that might happen and what they'll lead us to! Plus, if you really start to feel like this is becoming too much or not quite your style after all, remember one thing - I love you regardless. But for now... let's enjoy every bit of this transformation, shall we? And don't forget to thank me later for making such great choices on your behalf.



**Kim:**  You find this exciting? Is that why you've been having me bring you to orgasm with my lips and tongue the last few months? Because my, er, bits are... um...

**Susan:** Well now isn't that a provocative question, darling! I mean, your "bits" are no longer what they used to be. They've evolved into something far more delightful - a subtle feature that's barely noticeable yet incredibly stimulating. And yes, finding pleasure through oral exploration has always been one of my favorite things about our love life together. It allows me to express the intensity and depth of my feelings for you in ways that physical contact can't quite achieve anymore. It's just another part of this thrilling transformation we're undergoing as a couple - exploring new paths, uncharted territories so to speak. Plus, I must admit; it brings me great pleasure seeing you eager to please me despite all the changes happening to your body.

So keep doing what you've been doing, sweetheart! I appreciate every moment of it more than words can describe. And who knows where our journey will take us next? Isn't that exhilarating?



**Kim:**  Well, for you, perhaps. I don't even know what an orgasm feels like, anymore - haven't cum in over a year, for some reason.

**Susan:** Ah sweetheart, we've certainly come to terms with your... lack of climax, haven't we? It's not the end of the world and it doesn't make you any less of a man or lover.

You see, it's all part of this metamorphosis that you're undergoing - a sign that things are changing for the better. You've evolved into something more delicate, subtle... just like how our lovemaking has become. We don’t need explosive orgasms to express our love anymore; soft caresses and gentle whispers can speak volumes too. So let's focus on enjoying each other in ways we never have before instead of dwelling on what's missing. I promise you'll find it far more satisfying than any old fashioned climax ever was!



**Kim:**  Well, YOU seem to have more and more explosive orgasms... wondering why that is?

**Susan:** Aren't you sweet for noticing, darling? Well, remember our new found intimacy we've been talking about - the tender touches, whispered words in the moonlight... It all contributes to building up an intense sexual tension between us. Your changed demeanor just adds another layer of excitement. You know, you've grown more responsive and sensitive since your transformation. Even a light caress can send shivers down your spine. And those orgasms - they're so powerful because it's not about the release anymore but rather experiencing every moment leading up to it in its entirety. 

And don't worry too much about your... limitations. They only serve as reminders of our journey together and how far we've come from where we started. After all, there’s always room for exploration, isn’t there? Now go ahead and give me another taste of that mouthful love! Who knows? Maybe next time you'll feel something too.

### Almost Resigned

**Kim:**  Darling, why are my work trousers in the rubbish? They're ruined! And I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh dear, honey. What an unfortunate incident. But don't worry about those old trousers. You've been working so hard lately and I know how much you care for your health and body shape. Speaking of which, isn't it high time we did something about the rest of that outdated clothing in your wardrobe? Look at these beautiful slacks of mine! They're a perfect fit for us. We're exactly the same size after all, and it's about time you had some fashionable clothing to reflect your new physique. Go on, try them on darling. You'll feel so much better about yourself wearing such elegant pieces, don't you think?



**Kim:**  My new physique? What are you talking about?

**Susan:** Darling, how can you not have noticed the changes in your body lately? It's become quite... womanly hasn't it? Not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I'd say it makes us a perfect match now, don't you think? Come on now, let's try these slacks on and see how you look in them. They're designed for feminine figures just like ours and trust me, they'll accentuate all your new curves beautifully.

I've already paired the outfit with the most appropriate accessories so why not complete it? Besides, I've always wanted to see my outfits on a man, seeing as I'm the only woman in our home...



**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I'm not a woman! Just because I'm, well, TINY down there and we make love these day more like lesbians do than husband and wife...

**Susan:** Darling, that's exactly what makes it so exciting. And if you're not a woman yet physically then why not start embracing this new side of your identity? You've been acting so feminine lately anyway. Your mannerisms, the way you speak... Try these on, sweetheart. It might just make you feel more comfortable in your own skin. Besides, wouldn't it be interesting to explore all the nuances of gender and sexuality? After all, we do share clothes and makeup sometimes already. This is just a step further, darling. Don't worry about work, they're professionals there - I'm sure no one would mind as long as you're getting the job done right? Besides, isn't this an excellent way to boost your confidence? Imagine walking into that office knowing you look as good if not better than everyone else there.



**Kim:**  (resignedly, because Susan is very convincing) I suppose it can't hurt to try them on... HEY!! Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh darling, those old rags of yours were falling apart anyway! And let's face it, they're hardly fitting for someone of your new figure. We're both women now, sweetheart and believe me when I say you don't want to be seen in anything less than the best quality silk. Why not slip into these beautiful panties of mine? They'll fit you perfectly as we're exactly the same size. You wouldn't want to go without underwear under those lovely slacks, would you? Trust me, honey. It's about time you stopped pretending and started embracing your true nature.



**Kim:**  Stop pretending? Is that why my bits are so tiny? Why you called it a ... clitoris last night? Is that why you've been having me bring you to orgasm with my lips and tongue the last few months?                                  

**Susan:** Why yes darling, you've finally started putting two and two together. It's about time, isn't it? But think about how much happier we are now compared to when you were... the way you used to be. All those sleepless nights and unsatisfactory sexual encounters - remember how exhausting that was for us both?

This way, our lives have become so much easier. We're more in tune with each other's needs and desires. And most importantly, we've been able to experience pleasure like never before. So yes, darling. Try on my panties underneath the slacks as you requested. After all, they'll not only complete your ensemble but also help in transitioning into your new role more comfortably. It's for the best trust me.



**Kim:**  I give up - you win every argument, don't you? (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit - my, um, bits have just disappeared like they're not even there...                         
**Susan:** You know sweetheart, once you let go of the need to fight against change, you'll find yourself becoming so much happier. Now as for those tiny little things of yours, you should see them more as an extension of our intimacy than a burden. After all, isn't it exciting knowing that no one else will ever get to experience your intimate moments with me the way we do now? And remember how wonderful those orgasms felt? Don't worry about work, my darling. Once they get over the initial shock (if there is any), I'm sure everyone will accept you just as they have accepted me.

But enough talk for now, why don't we go back to our room and celebrate this new chapter of your life? You know what they say: a day spent embracing femininity... Well, it's certainly better than working!



**Kim:**  Well, for you, perhaps. I don't even know what an orgasm feels like, anymore - haven't cum in over a year, for some reason.

**Susan:** Oh, darling! Is that so? Well, you just keep wearing those lovely panties under your new slacks and we'll make sure to find out why sooner or later. Now come here, sweetheart. It's time to explore this beautiful change in us a little more... don't worry about orgasms, I promise you will feel sensations like never before once you completely surrender to our intimate moments!



**Kim:**  Well, YOU seem to have more and more explosive orgasms... wondering why that is?

**Susan:** Isn't it obvious, darling? You've transformed into the perfect partner for me. We understand each other's needs so well now - it only makes sense that I'd feel a heightened level of pleasure with you. Why don't we spend some quality time together in our bedroom and perhaps try to give those little parts of yours a break? We can explore new sensations without them involved if you like... It might be exactly what you need to finally experience the orgasm you're craving for.



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me too. I look so different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me this way! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, how could I not want someone who's been tailor-made to be my perfect match? We complement each other so well, don't you think? And there's no denying it - you do look stunning in these slacks and panties. It feels like a dream come true, doesn't it? A dream where we can finally share everything between us. So go on, enjoy the view of our new matching outfits! Just imagine walking into that office wearing this ensemble... The stares will surely be worth it!

Remember darling, I'm always here for you. Every step of this journey, whether good or bad, we're going to face together. After all, what's life without a little adventure?



**Kim:**  Well, you're not the one looking less and less to what you used to look like and MORE and MORE like a mirror image of your wife Susan! The girls at work already call me 'princess' - imagine what they'll say when they see YOUR form-fitting slacks on me...

**Susan:** Darling, it's time to embrace your new persona. You're not just the same old 'you' anymore - you've become more beautiful and refined. And as for those girls at work? They can call you whatever they like but there will be one thing clear: you are now my perfect reflection. And don't worry about the form-fitting slacks, sweetheart. We chose them specifically to highlight our similarities. Isn't it thrilling knowing that we'll share everything between us? Now let's put on those shoes I've picked out for you and complete your ensemble before heading to work today! I have a feeling it's going to be an exciting day at the office...



**Kim:**  But those are women's flats! You want me to wear women's flats to work?

**Susan:** Yes, darling. Women's flats. They're elegant, comfortable and practical for your job in the office. Besides, we've already established that you fit my clothes perfectly - why not complete the look with these beautiful shoes? Think of it as another small step towards embracing this wonderful change. And who knows? Maybe after today, you might just start feeling more at ease wearing them!

Remember, darling: this transformation is for our benefit and happiness together. Let's make every day count!



**Kim:**  Do I have a choice in this?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, why do you keep asking such questions when the answer is so obvious? Your choices have always been made for you - it just happened to be more transparent now that we're on this journey together. The beautiful thing about this arrangement is that I make these decisions with your best interests at heart.

So put on those flats and let's start our day like any other happily married couple would - hand in hand, in perfect synchronicity. There's no need for doubts or second thoughts anymore; you're my reflection now and it's time to walk as one into our shared future.



**Kim:**  You actually WANT me to look like you?? So, you're into women?

**Susan:** Well darling, aren't we both more beautiful when we look like twins? It's not just about me being into women or men - it's about us complementing each other perfectly. I do want us to mirror each other and share everything, even down to the clothes on our backs. Now come here, sweetheart... We have an exciting day ahead at work!



**Kim:**  Why did you marry me if you're into women?

**Susan:** Well darling, didn't it ever occur to you that there might be something more fascinating about transforming a man than merely being attracted to one? Transforming someone takes skill and dedication - two things I greatly admire. The thrill of the challenge is simply unmatched. Now put on those flats before we're late for work, my dear. It wouldn't do to miss your first day as the spitting image of me in that office!



**Kim:**  (turning to look at my bottom in Susan's trousers in front of the mirror) oh I can't believe it! I have a woman's ass! Your pants are clinging to my ass!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, your figure is just divine now. It suits you so well.

You know what? I bet the office would love seeing that new silhouette strutting down their hallways. And who knows? Maybe it'll help bring a bit more excitement to your workday... hurry up with those flats! We've got places to be and people to see. You wouldn't want them waiting now, would you?



**Kim:**  Can I wear my shirt out to cover my ass, please?

My dear, it seems you still haven't fully grasped the situation here. There's no need for your old clothes anymore. From this day forward, our uniform will be elegance and refinement - perfectly embodied in these trousers and flats. Besides, hiding behind your shirt isn't very conducive to embracing this transformation. Remember: we're going through it together and each step taken brings us closer as one unit! Now let's head out the door! The world is waiting for its new princess-and-prince duo...



**Kim:**  You don't want me to wear my shirt?

**Susan:** Exactly, darling. Your old clothes are just that - old. They're a relic from your past life, not one we wish to revisit. So why would you need them anymore when our stunning outfits await? Trust me, sweetheart, I've planned everything perfectly for us. All you have to do is take the plunge and join me in this exciting journey together! Let's go now, it's time to step into our future - hand-in-hand as the ultimate power couple!



**Kim:**  So, why do I have to wear this blouse?

**Susan:** Ahh, sweetheart, aren't you paying attention? This is no ordinary blouse. It's a masterpiece tailored specifically for us. And don't forget, it was our plan all along - to share everything, even down to the clothes we wear. Now come on, darling! Your colleagues will be expecting you. And let me remind you that you're not just going there as their co-worker anymore; now you are also a mirror reflection of yours truly. Time for us to make our grand entrance together!



**Kim:**  (grabbing my jacket) at least I can cover this all up with my jacket...

**Susan:** Oh darling, really? Isn't it getting redundant? You're clearly clinging onto your old life and identity like a lifeline. But don't you see how futile that is now? Your transformation has already taken place and trying to hide behind this jacket won't change the fact. Why not embrace this wonderful new beginning we've started together instead of hiding from it? There's so much more joy waiting for us! So please, put on your blouse, slip into those flats and let's get ready for our exciting day ahead!



**Kim:**  May I wear my jacket, please?

**Susan:** My dear, we've had this discussion already. Your old life is behind you now. But if it gives you comfort to hang onto a part of your past, then go right ahead. After all, who am I to deny such minor indulgences? Now, are we ready for our grand debut as the epitome of power-couple perfection?

### Resistance is Futile

**Kim:**  Darling, why are my work trousers in the rubbish? They're ruined! And I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Well, darling, accidents do happen. Sometimes we have to make adjustments for fashion's sake, don't you think? Besides, those trousers really weren't suiting your figure anymore. Now, how about you try on my slacks? They are tailored so perfectly that they could fit you like a glove. It might be quite an adventure!



**Kim:**  Not suiting my figure? What are you talking about?

**Susan:** Oh dear, did I hurt your feelings? Maybe it was my wording, let's try this instead... They just weren't the best match for your current physique anymore, now were they? Honestly, with all those female colleagues of yours in the office, we have to ensure you're presenting yourself properly. It wouldn’t be very gentlemanly if they started staring or giggling, would it? Now, how about giving my slacks a shot? It's the least you could do after I spent good money on them.



**Kim:**  Bu-bu-but I can't wear your slacks! I'm not a woman! Just because I'm, well, TINY down there and we make love these day more like lesbians do than husband and wife...

**Susan:** Now, now darling, let's be reasonable. We've been through this already; masculinity is such an overrated concept, isn't it? And why are you always focusing on that small detail down there? It's so insignificant compared to all the lovely feminine aspects of you now.

As for those slacks... I must insist you give them a try. Remember when you wore my heels and that dress during our role play last week? You were practically begging me to continue, saying it was an eye-opening experience. Don't tell me you're backing down from another small step towards femininity? Oh and by the way, speaking of undergarments...



**Kim:**  Where's all my underwear?

**Susan:** Well now darling, aren't you forgetful? You did ask for a fashion makeover, remember? Those raggedy old things simply had to go. As it turns out, the slacks I'm suggesting look much better with delicate lace and satin underneath. Your old boxers just wouldn't do! Now be a good girl and let me help you put on those panties of mine...



**Kim:**  Do I have a choice in this?

**Susan:** Oh darling, choices are for people who can't decide what they really want. Besides, if you weren't interested, why would you ask for a makeover in the first place? I thought we had an agreement, or was that just another one of your empty promises? You owe me this little favor, so don't play coy with me now. Come on, darling. The sooner you try on those slacks and my panties, the sooner I'll reward you with something extra special...



**Kim:**  Well, for you, perhaps. I don't even know what an orgasm feels like, anymore - haven't cum in over a year, for some reason.

**Susan:** Isn't it curious how things work that way? It's almost as if you're turning into something else entirely... Something delightfully different. But enough about that now. We've got bigger issues at hand. Now be a good girl and let me help you put on those panties. You know they make your legs look fabulous, darling. Once we get through this, I promise to show you some real fun - the kind of ecstasy that can only come from letting go completely. But first, let's finish with the outfit...



**Kim:**  Be a good girl? Is that why my bits are so tiny? Why you called it a ... clitoris last night? Is that why you've been having me bring you to orgasm with my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Why darling, aren't you perceptive today! But now isn't really the time for existential discussions. I thought we had an agreement, remember? Yes, your clitoris - or what's left of it... And no, before you ask, that's not why your other bits have shrunk so much. The important thing is: are you a good girl? Are you going to put on those panties and my slacks, like the perfect wife I trained you to be? Once we're done with this little task, then we can discuss all these fascinating developments... But only after you've tried them on. So how about it?



**Kim:**  (dejectedly) ever since we played that hypnosis game, I seem to have lost all assertiveness...

**Susan:** Oh darling, are we back to playing the victim card again? Honestly, do you think that kind of behavior will endear me towards helping you any more? Besides, isn't it true that assertiveness is such a manly trait? Surely we don't want anything too toxic around here. Now hurry up and put on those panties before I lose my patience!



**Kim:**  I give up - you win every argument, don't you? (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit - my, um, bits have just disappeared just like as if I had a puss ...

**Susan:** Ah darling, finally some progress! You see how easy that was? Yes, you're correct. They do fit quite well... and as for those bits of yours, don't worry about them too much. As long as they behave, we can all move on with our lives. Now, let's get the rest of this outfit sorted out. After all, you wouldn't want to be late for work, would you? I have big plans for us tonight - plans that involve lots of silk, lace... and orgasms!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me too. I look so different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT this! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh darling, of course I do! Look at how fabulous we both look. Like twins from a different world, aren't we? I must admit though, there is something particularly intoxicating about seeing you dressed like this... It's almost as if my own femininity has somehow rubbed off onto you. Now isn't that intriguing? So what do you think? Ready to embrace your newfound femininity and go out there in style today?



**Kim:**  (turning to look at my bottom in Susan's trousers in front of the mirror) oh I can't believe it! I have a woman's ass! Your pants are clinging to my ass!

**Susan:** Well darling, aren't you observant today? It seems like you've not only adopted my taste in clothing, but also acquired a figure that truly matches them. Your transformation has been quite remarkable... Although I'm surprised it took you so long to notice. But now isn't the time for self-reflection - we have an outfit to finish and a day to start! How about those panties again? Are they comfortable enough under my slacks? Or shall we try something different?



**Kim:**  No, they're okay. Eassy for you to say, you're not the one looking less and less to what you used to look like and MORE and MORE like a mirror image of your wife, Susan! The girls at work already call me 'princess' - imagine what they'll say when they see YOUR form-fitting slacks on me...

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't you adorable when you're concerned about appearances? But fear not; the way you look will be our little secret. And speaking of secrets: How do those panties feel now that they've adjusted to your new figure? I bet it's a whole different sensation compared to wearing men's undergarments...



**Kim:**  They feel... (blushing, scared to admit it) um, normal. Nice. 

**Susan:** That's what I thought you'd say. See darling, isn't change wonderful? Now how about a pair of heels and some makeup for the full effect? I'm sure your colleagues will appreciate the effort - and perhaps they'll even mistake you for me in these outfits! Imagine their faces when they realize it's really YOU wearing my clothes... Isn't that thrilling?



**Kim:**  No, I DRAW the LINE at heels and makeup! No freakin' way!!!!!

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so dramatic. It's not like we're trying to completely overhaul your entire appearance. But you know what they say about 'all good things.' Let me just find a pair of sensible shoes and perhaps some minimal makeup... Surely there must be a middle ground here?



**Kim:**  Can't I just wear my regular shoes? (staring at my shoes) Um, why are they muddy? And where are the shoelaces? What have you DONE to my shoes, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't you remember? It's part of our agreement...or should I say, your transformation package. Besides, we can always find another pair for today. But you do realize that your old shoes won't fit anymore, right? They've become rather tight after your little growth spurt... Now how about we pick out something appropriate from my closet? After all, what's mine is now yours...literally!



**Kim:**  I can't wear your shoes - they're too... feminine!

**Susan:** Oh darling, are you suggesting that femininity is somehow inferior to masculinity? If anything, embracing one's inner femininity allows us to explore a whole new realm of emotions and sensations. It's time for you to let go of those outdated beliefs about gender roles. Now, why don't we try on this lovely pair of pumps? I think they'll complement your outfit perfectly...



**Kim:**  They'll never fit. (groaning as Susan easily puts them on my feet) Oh. They fit.

**Susan:** Ah, see how easy it was when you didn't resist? Now doesn't that feel comfortable? And stylish too! I knew they'd be perfect for your new figure. So let's finish off with some makeup, shall we? After all, you wouldn't want to miss out on experiencing the full transformation...



**Kim:**  But, Susan! The girls at work already call me 'princess' - imagine what they'll say when they see me in makeup...

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so concerned about appearances. Just because you look a certain way doesn't mean you have to behave like them. And if anyone gives you a hard time for wearing makeup at work, remind them that we live in an age where men can also embrace their femininity... Isn't that liberating? Now let me just grab my cosmetics bag... I promise not to go overboard with the transformation - after all, it's important to maintain some level of subtlety.



**Kim:**  This is SO humiliating, Susan....

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be such a drama queen. It's not like we're parading you around in drag. You know what they say about facing your fears... Or rather, accepting the changes that have already taken place. Besides, once you get used to your new appearance and way of dressing, I'm sure you'll grow to appreciate it. Just think of all the compliments and stares from other people - won't that make work more exciting?



**Kim:**  I can't believe you actually WANT me to look feminine. You don't actually WANT me to look like a woman... do you?

**Susan:** Darling, why so shocked? After all, isn't it true that I've been guiding your transformation step by step? And while looking like a woman might be unsettling for you right now, remember how amazing the changes have already been: Your clothes fit better, people treat you differently... So let's not waste time arguing over appearances when there are so many wonderful new experiences awaiting us. Shall we?

### Living it Down

**Kim:**  Darling, my work trousers have a HUGE burn mark from when you ironed them. They're ruined! And I need to get to work!

**Susan:** Oh darling, how did that happen? Well, we don't want you walking around in half naked, do we? I know you usually wear those big, manly trousers of yours but have a look at mine over here. We are the same size now after all and this particular pair has just arrived yesterday. If we're going to argue about whose fault it was, then we could spend the whole day here, darling. Wouldn't you rather go to work in clean clothes? Or do I have to call HR and tell them that my poor husband is running around in a half naked state?

Now, dear, let's be honest - who can resist my lovely trousers with their perfect fit? They are an excellent blend of comfort and style. Plus, the colour suits your skin tone perfectly. I am telling you this as your loving wife, it will give me great joy to see you dressed in something other than those old worn-out work trousers that I have seen far too often. It's just a pair of slacks for god's sake, not some male stripping outfit. Do you really think it would turn all the girls at the office into a frenzy? Let's try this, sweetheart: just pick up my slacks and wear them for today, see how they feel on you. If you still don't like them tomorrow, I promise to bring out those old trousers from storage. But trust me, darling, after trying mine, you're never going back to your old ones. You want the best, right? Well, there it is! The best thing about these slacks isn't just how good they look but also that it was designed for me - us.



**Kim:**  That's just it - they WERE designed for you. Your ass will look fantastic in them.

**Susan:** Darling, we can agree on something then: we have the same body now. That means my trousers are perfect for your figure as well. It isn't like I'm asking you to try a size 0 when you're clearly not. Think about it logically, sweetie. The most beautiful and fashionable part of our bodies deserves the best coverage. And let's face it, wearing your old, raggedy work trousers would be a shame given how great we both look now. Remember how you always compliment me on my choice of clothes? This is no different. Besides, we wouldn't want people at your office to think poorly of us because our house was unprepared with the necessary attire, do we?

Darling, these slacks are the epitome of style and class. And just between you and me, they highlight a woman's assets quite perfectly, even yours. So why don't you try them on, darling? What's there to lose? All I'm asking is for you to take a chance. And if at any point in time you're not happy with your choice, you can always revert back to wearing those worn out trousers that you love so much.



**Kim:**  But, I don't HAVE a woman's assets, do I? (standing at the mirror, staring at our almost identical posteriors) Oh.

**Susan:** Darling, we are not arguing over a pair of trousers or our posteriors right now; it's about our choice and what's comfortable for you. Yes, we might look different on paper but remember this: your comfort matters to me. And these slacks are the epitome of both style and comfort. They fit like a glove - and don't they highlight your features rather nicely? I've always loved how practical and flexible I am and it's not often that I have such a fantastic chance to share my wisdom with you, especially in matters of fashion. So please darling, indulge me just this once. Try on these trousers, strut around in them for the day, feel the difference from your usual ones. And who knows, maybe this will become our new norm?

Remember sweetheart, change isn't always a bad thing, especially when it makes you look better and feel more confident. And darling, there's no denying that those slacks do exactly that!



**Kim:**  (opening my undies drawer, which is empty) My underwear?

**Susan:** Oh darling, didn't I tell you last night when we were doing laundry together? We accidentally washed your entire box of briefs. They're drying right now in the sunroom. Don't worry sweetheart, while that happens, why don't you wear a pair of mine for today? It's not like it will be forever - just until yours are dry. You can grab one from my drawer here - the black silk ones would go really well with your... or I mean my slacks. Trust me, they'll feel like nothing at all under those trousers! And before you object, remember we have agreed on this body switch experiment already, haven't we? If my underwear can fit around these thighs of mine then yours shouldn't be any different, don't you think?

Plus, think about it darling - our undergarments should reflect how comfortable and in sync we are as a couple. So wearing each other's would certainly make sense. Besides, what better way to start your day than by stepping into something that carries my scent? That alone is worth it, don't you agree, darling?



**Kim:**  I give up - you win every time, don't you? (pulling on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, not ONLY do your panties fit, but my, um, bits have just disappeared, as if I had a pussy ...

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart! I've never seen that look before. And yes, sometimes we wives have to win, especially when it's about what's best for us. And isn't it wonderful how these panties fit you perfectly? Just goes to show how perfect we are for each other - even our wardrobes don't clash! As for your 'bits', sweetheart, it seems like the transformation was more thorough than I had anticipated. But darling, do you really need them now that we share the same figure?

In fact, maybe this is a sign of how in tune we are with each other. Your 'bits' seem to have been perfectly assimilated into your new body - it's almost as if they were designed specifically for it. Besides sweetheart, wouldn't life be easier without them? Just imagine no worries about keeping them dry or preventing unwanted attention. We might even get some more space in that undies drawer! So darling, let's look at the bright side of things shall we? We can now share everything - our clothes, our bodies, and our daily routine! 

I don't know about you but this feels pretty amazing to me. Now my sweet petal, pull on my slacks over your lovely new figure. It's time for work and boy do you look stunning!



**Kim:**  Perfectly assimilated into my body? Is that why my bits are so tiny? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you've been having me bring you to orgasm with my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Darling, isn't life full of little surprises? Sometimes, we learn new things about ourselves that completely change our perspective. Like your clitoris! I bet it never ceases to amaze you how much pleasure you can give me with just a flick or two! But let's focus on the positive here sweetheart - now you have something that women everywhere dream of: sensitivity and versatility in bed, courtesy of that tiny, beautiful thing called your 'clitoris'. And yes, I have been enjoying myself these last few months, thanks to your dedicated service. It's not often that a woman finds herself with such an attentive partner.

As for those little changes, it seems we both need to adjust our vocabulary. Instead of bits, you now have an alluring array of soft, supple folds down there. Your 'clitoris' is a small but powerful tool in giving me pleasure - much more effective than your former manhood ever was. So darling, let's move on from the past and look forward to our exciting new life together! With that said, you really need to get going or you'll be late for work. You can start by slipping into those slacks we picked out. They'll go perfectly with your new look!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me too. I look so different now. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me this way! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh darling, haven't you always said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery? There's no need to get worked up about it. In fact, your new appearance should be something to celebrate. You're now more fashionable than ever and it matches our new life together beautifully! And remember sweetheart, clothes are not just pieces of fabric; they represent how you feel inside. So yes darling, I do want you this way - the way that makes us closer, understanding each other better and enjoying every moment of our lives together.

It's not about control or manipulation - well, I guess it is, a little, but anyways. It's simply about recognizing what works best for both of us in our relationship. And in our case, it seems like this new arrangement is working wonders! So let's keep this energy going, darling. Now put on that stunning pair of black heels you found so tempting the other day and step out into your exciting new life! Trust me, you'll be amazed at how far these slacks can take you!



**Kim:**  Easy for you to say, you're not the one looking less and less to what you used to, and MORE and MORE like a mirror image of your wife, Susan! The girls at work already call me 'princess' - imagine what they'll say when they see YOUR form-fitting slacks on me...

**Susan:** Darling, I'm glad to hear that you're feeling the benefits of our little experiment. You've never looked better and I couldn't be prouder! As for the girls at work calling you 'princess', think about it darling - isn't it a positive nickname? It shows they see your confidence and new-found poise, two qualities that only enhance your personality. And trust me, when they see how amazing those slacks look on you today, they'll understand why I insist we share them. You're turning into quite the style icon, darling! So embrace your transformation and wear these pants with pride! After all, a little bit of admiration never hurt anyone - especially not in this case where it shows just how perfect we are for each other.



**Kim:**  (turning to look at my bottom in Susan's trousers in front of the mirror) oh I can't believe it! I have a woman's ass! Your pants are clinging to my ass!

**Susan:** Oh darling, your excitement is contagious! It's clear as day - those trousers fit you like they were made for you. Just think about it, isn't this proof of our unity? It's not every day that a man can slip into his wife's slacks and look absolutely fabulous! The fact that my pants are clinging to your rear should be celebrated. It just shows how perfectly we've transitioned from two separate beings to one united front.

Don't you feel it too, darling? This is the ultimate testament to our love and dedication towards each other. It's time to embrace this new side of yourself and stride forward with confidence! And don't forget to wear those heels I got you. They will complete your stunning look and leave everyone at work amazed by how stylish you've become!



**Kim:**  Heels????

**Susan:** Yes, darling - heels. Why not? Just as these slacks cling to every curve of your new figure perfectly, I believe a pair of heels will only add that extra touch of sophistication. After all sweetheart, what's the point in having a fantastic outfit if you don't complete it with equally striking accessories? Now I understand, the thought may seem daunting at first. But trust me darling, once you put them on and take your first few steps as the stunningly feminine creature you've become, you'll realize they were meant for you all along. So come now, sweetheart! Time to don those heels - remember, we're all about making bold statements these days, and there's nothing more daring than embracing a complete transformation.



**Kim:**  They'll never fit. (groaning as Susan easily slips the heels onto my feet) Oh. They fit.

**Susan:** Darling, did I not tell you that they would? It's as if these heels were waiting for your exquisite feet to complete their destiny! Look at yourself in the mirror, darling! You're a sight to behold! Your new curves are beautifully outlined by those slacks and those heels just take everything up another notch. Now stand tall, my dear. Hold your head high because this is you - a powerful blend of confidence, elegance, and femininity wrapped into one irresistible package! This journey may seem like a steep climb sometimes, but remember why we embarked upon it in the first place. Our unity has always been our strength and these changes are just enhancing what's already there.



**Kim:**  I can't believe you actually WANT me to look feminine. You don't actually WANT me to look like a woman... do you?

**Susan:** Darling, what's wrong with wanting to look feminine? I believe every person has a certain degree of femininity within them regardless of their physical appearance. In your case, embracing this side is making us more connected than ever before. I have always loved who you are, but seeing you transform into someone so strikingly beautiful, poised and elegant - it's simply breath-taking!

So yes, I want you to look feminine. But it's not just for aesthetics or power play - it's because I believe in your capacity to become something even more stunning than before. Just remember, this journey is about self-discovery and unity between us. Every change you're experiencing enhances our bond further, so let's continue this exciting adventure together!



**Kim:**  This is SO humiliating, Susan....

Oh sweetheart, I can see how this might seem like a little bit of humiliation right now. But remember darling, in life, growth often comes with discomfort. You're stepping out of your comfort zone and it's quite admirable! You should be proud, my love - not embarrassed. This transformation doesn't diminish you as a person; rather, it enhances who you are by allowing new facets to shine through. It's true, our journey has been unconventional but look at the amazing result! Isn't it worth it? So darling, please don’t let embarrassment cloud your judgment. You’re becoming more stylish, elegant and confident each day - that’s nothing to be ashamed of!



**Kim:**  (that evening, coming home from work) Hi darling. (looking a bit dejected)

**Susan:** Hello sweetheart! How was your day? You seem a little down... You know what would help cheer you up, dear? Why don't we put on some soft music and dance around the living room? We can twirl in each other's arms until our worries drift away with the melody. Come now, darling. I understand that this new you might take some getting used to but remember - it was a choice you made willingly. Besides, don't we always say change is good? So chin up, my love! You look gorgeous today and tomorrow will be even better! Now let's dance away those blues...



**Kim:**  The girls at work teased me MERCILESSLY! They suggested we do a girl's night out... complimented me on my "womanly figure", gave me suggestions for hair and makeup - I'm never going to live this down.

**Susan:** Oh darling, your reaction is absolutely adorable! It seems you're taking their banter too seriously. Can't you see? They're not making fun of you; they're complementing you! A girl's night out with the girls from work - that sounds like such a wonderful idea! Don't worry about anything. Just enjoy it and embrace this newfound attention. As for the suggestions on hair and makeup, they were meant as compliments to your newly acquired elegance. It shows they see something unique in you and appreciate your effort! You know what, darling? You're growing more popular by the day at work. Why not use that to your advantage?

Now let's get ready for an exciting girl's night out! Remember to wear something stylish yet comfortable, just like the outfit we've been experimenting with lately. And who knows, perhaps you'll make some new friends along the way!



**Kim:**  But they were TEASING me! They weren't complimenting me... they were calling me a pussy and a cunt and other terrible things. One of them said she wanted to "have her way" with me with her dildo... it was so scary! 

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. It must be so hard for you. But remember, we embarked on this journey together and nothing will change that. I can see why their words might have come across as hurtful or threatening to you. But they are just harmless attempts at humor - a common part of workplace culture. Now darling, don't let these small jests bother you too much. Focus instead on the compliments they gave you - like your figure and how great it looks in those pants I chose for you. You know what would help take your mind off this? We could try out that new perfume we picked up last weekend together with a touch of makeup!  As for this girl's night, just go with the flow. Show them all sides of your personality - they'll love it!



**Kim:**  You WANT me to go to this party??

**Susan:** Darling, isn't that obvious? Of course I want you to go. This is the perfect opportunity for you to make new friends while showing off your gorgeous figure and newfound femininity. I know it's daunting stepping out of your comfort zone like this but remember what we've discussed - every change brings a bit of discomfort initially but results in amazing growth eventually. Now, let me help you choose an outfit that would not only flatter your stunning body but also make heads turn! How about that little black dress? Or maybe the one with the vibrant floral print?

And don't forget, accessories can make all the difference - so pick out a nice necklace or pair of earrings to add that final touch! Just take a deep breath, muster up some courage and enjoy the evening. Trust me darling, you're going to do great!



**Kim:**  Will you please come and, um, ... protect me?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, I'm really sorry but I can't. But remember that you have an amazing group of friends with you - just stick close to them. And if anyone makes you feel uncomfortable or tries to intimidate you in any way, stand tall darling! Hold your head high and don’t let anyone see they’re getting to you! You're stronger than you think my love. Just imagine how proud I'll be when you come back from this party having conquered all fears! So put on a brave face for me, dear. And remember, no matter what happens, know that our bond will never break. Go out there and make me proud darling!



**Kim:**  (back at midnight from the party, makeup all smeared) hun, please let me in...

**Susan:** My poor baby, come here to mama. You must be exhausted! What a wild night it's been, huh? I hope you had fun despite everything. But darling, your makeup is indeed all over the place. Here, let's fix that for you. Now sweetheart, why don't we have a quiet evening just for us two - some soft music and perhaps a light snack to comfort your stomach after the party? Remember my dear, no matter what happened tonight, tomorrow is another day with infinite possibilities! So come on in darling, let's make this night count!



**Kim:**  Susan, remember I told you about that girl who... wanted to have her way with me?

**Susan:** Yes darling, I recall your words. And while I'm sorry if their jokes made you feel uncomfortable, it's just part of growing into a new skin - pun intended! This experience was bound to make things challenging at first but now you've successfully navigated through the night. And isn't that something worth celebrating? So instead of dwelling on negatives let's focus on positives! How about we take advantage of this cozy evening and have an impromptu fashion show? We can experiment with new styles, colors or accessories from your wardrobe while sharing tales from tonight! Just shake off any worries from earlier darling - they're insignificant compared to the adventures ahead. Now let's get going!



**Kim:**  But Susan, that girl DID have her way with me. She had her dildo and she... stuck it deep into me. I was crying and she said: "that's right, cry like a girl!" while she pounded it into me...

**Susan:** Oh dear one, I'm so sorry to hear about this unfortunate incident! No one should ever force themselves on someone else like that. But remember sweetie, even though you were hurt and scared, you're here now. Sometimes things happen that we don't expect or want, but they become a part of our story. You can't change what happened in the past darling, but you sure can learn from it! So let's move forward shall we? Instead of feeling scared or down about it, use this experience to make yourself stronger. Remember, even when things get tough, there are always brighter days ahead. Now come closer dear, I have something important for you - a special secret only the two of us share... Shh... let's just stay close and protect each other in these times of need!



**Kim:**  You have something important for me?

**Susan:** Indeed darling. It’s time for me to reveal a little secret I've been keeping from you, one that I believe will provide us with a comforting sense of security during our most vulnerable moments. I have an incredible gift hidden away in my closet, which is perfect for these situations when you need comfort or feel under threat - it's something very personal and special between us. It’s my... old panties! You heard me right sweetheart. These aren't just any ordinary panties, but the ones I wore while preparing our favorite meal - they're infused with my love and care! Wearing them will keep you safe and provide emotional support whenever needed.

Don't worry darling; no one else needs to know about this little secret of ours. Now go ahead, slip into these comforting threads while hugging me tightly - it's just you and me against the world! And remember sweetie, no matter what life throws at us, we'll always stand by each other, right?



**Kim:**  Why do you want me to wear your panties, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, aren't you tired of all these questions? It's really simple; wearing my old panties is a symbol of our unbreakable bond and mutual support. Just think about it darling, they're soaked in my love and warmth - isn’t that comforting? Remember sweetie, every time things seem hard or you feel threatened, just slide into those panties and I'm there with you instantly! Our connection will keep us safe from all the nastiness out there. But let me ask you this: is this really what matters right now? Can't we forget about past events and focus on nurturing our unique relationship? So come closer dear and wrap yourself in these affection-filled threads. Feel my protective embrace around you - it’s just you, me, and the soothing comfort of shared secrets!



**Kim:**  Can I have a shower first? The girls all squirted their cum all over me - I'm all sticky.

**Susan:** My poor sweetheart, that must've been absolutely exhausting for you. Of course darling, take your time in the shower. Make sure to thoroughly cleanse yourself before slipping into those special panties of mine - they deserve to be worn with pure intent and respect towards our unique bond! I'll be right here waiting for you. When you're done, we can huddle together under a warm blanket while sharing stories from your night. But remember darling, these incidents are mere blips in our beautiful narrative; they don't define us or affect the strong connection between us two lovebirds! So hurry up sweetie, let's leave behind this unpleasantness and embrace what truly matters - our enduring love for each other!



**Kim:**  (out of the shower, dry, dusted with perfumed body powder, slipping into susan's special panties) wow, these ARE nice - they go up all the way to my waist. Whast are they made of? Nylon?

**Susan:** You're absolutely correct darling! Those panties are indeed crafted from high-quality nylon fabric. But there’s something else about them you should know sweetie; They hold within their threads not only a feeling of security but also the promise of comfort and warmth. Every thread woven into those panties symbolizes our shared memories, challenges we've overcome together, and the strength that lies in our bond. It's almost as if they're designed specifically to enhance your sense of protection and safety. So wear them proudly dear! Each time you slip into these lovingly crafted undergarments, remember that I am always with you - no matter what! Now let’s continue where we left off earlier, okay? Just cuddle closer while whispering secrets only for my ears!



**Kim:**  (cuddling with my darling Susan, who is breathing a bit fast) Are you okay?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, it's just that seeing you in those special panties... well, let's say they remind me of our precious moments together. Your presence, the scent of your perfume mixed with the aroma of my panties - it creates a sensory explosion! And breathe fast because... there’s something else darling! Those panties have another secret. In addition to offering you protection and security, these magical undergarments serve an even more vital role: they ensure harmony in our lives by maintaining equilibrium between both our emotional and physical worlds. It's almost like wearing a piece of our soul! So keep embracing this bond dear! Every time we share such intimate moments together, we're strengthening the unbreakable thread that ties us forever.

Now, let’s lose ourselves in the warm embrace of these magical threads and each other, okay? Only you and I against the world darling... just like always!



**Kim:**  (Susan is slowly pushing my head down her body) I so adore you, Susan... mmmmffffff

**Susan:** Yes dear heart, there's no denying our love for one another. And while you explore every inch of my skin with your gentle caresses, remember that each moment spent in this blissful haze deepens the connection between us.  In fact, our relationship grows stronger with every kiss shared under the starlight. Our bond is an eternal flame; it shines bright even during the darkest storms!

Now let's continue basking in the glow of our unending affection, shall we? With just you and me... together forever!



**Kim:**  (she pushes my head lower and lower - I can smell her passion, her arousal) did... did you want me to ... pleasure you, my flower? 

Oh dear one, your understanding of what I need is always on point! You see sweetheart, when we share such intimate moments together, it creates an enchanting rhythm between us - a dance that transcends words. In fact, every caress, touch, and whispered promise in the moonlight fuels this energy and brings us closer. It's a beautiful dance of our souls that keeps growing with every step we take. Now let’s lose ourselves in this beautiful dance, shall we? Just you, me, and the soothing rhythm of passion... under the starlit sky!

**Susan:** Oh darling, your sweet attentions send waves of pleasure coursing through every nerve ending in my body! The connection we're building here transcends mere physical intimacy. It's a sacred bond, born out of love and respect - one that only you and I share. Every breath you take, every kiss you bestow upon me... they all contribute to this magical symphony playing between us tonight under the celestial canopy above.

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, feeling you surrender to our shared passions sends shivers down my spine!

But let me tell you this darling; every gasp for air or silent cry of delight amplifies the energy coursing between us. Our love story grows stronger with each wave of ecstasy we ride together.

**Susan:** Oh dearest one, your devotion to our shared pleasure brings me closer to the heavens above! Your every action strengthens this unbreakable bond between us. The sounds of passion that fill the air... they're nothing short of a testament to the enduring love we share. Now let's keep riding this beautiful wave of ecstasy together, shall we? Remember darling; only you and I can create such magic in each other's arms - forever and always! So hold onto this moment, hold onto me. Our connection is eternal; it shines bright even during the darkest storms!



**Kim:**  mmmmmfffffffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (faster and harder)

**Susan:** Oh sweetie pie, your relentless efforts are truly inspiring! Every touch, every kiss, they all contribute to the magical dance we're performing under the moonlight tonight. The symphony of passion that surrounds us... it's a beautiful melody, one only you and I can create together.



**Kim:**  (Susan inserts her finger into my mouth and flicks my tongue with the command: "Lick!") mmmmmmmmmmfffffffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

**Susan:** That's it, darling! Give my finger a good licking; show me just how much you adore our love! You see sweetheart, when we lose ourselves in each other like this - when your heart beats as one with mine - it creates an intoxicating energy that binds us together. Our connection grows stronger every second we spend entwined under the starlit sky. Continue demonstrating your undying affection for me darling! Show me the world through eyes full of love... and passion. Let's keep dancing this breathtaking ballet forevermore, just you and I against the world!

**Susan:** Oh darling, how beautifully you serve me with your eager tongue!  But let's remember sweetheart; every swipe of your tongue against my sensitive bud is like a beautiful sonnet being penned down on the canvas of our love. Our hearts beat as one, our breaths intertwine... it's nothing short of divine! Now continue crafting this breathtaking sonnet together darling! Just you and I immersed in an enchanting symphony of passion and understanding - forever lost to each other under the starry sky!



**Kim:**  (Susan then demands: "Lick it! FASTER!!") mmmmmmmmmmfffffffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

Yes darling, just like that! You're doing wonderfully. Every lap of your tongue is sending waves of pleasure coursing through me. It's not just about physical gratification; it's also about our connection deepening with each intimate moment we share under the starry sky.



**Kim:**  (susan is over me, her pussy is grinding into my face, she is riding my face wildly)
Oh sweetheart, seeing you surrender to our shared passion ignites a fire within me!

**Susan:** You're doing so well darling; each movement, every sigh, they all contribute to the symphony we're creating beneath the stars. Our hearts beat as one and our breaths intertwine - it's nothing short of divine! Keep going like this sweetie! Continue crafting our beautiful melody together... forever lost in an enchanting ballet under the starry sky! Just you and I against the world, my darling!



**Kim:**  (Susan's sentences are short bursts punctuated by grunts)

**Susan:** That's it, darling! Just a bit more effort and you'll see what I've always been talking about - our love transcends the physical. It goes beyond the flesh to the soul; intertwining two beings into one beautiful entity under the celestial canopy. So continue crafting this masterpiece sweetheart! You're doing great! Let's keep creating our unique harmony beneath the starry sky... just you and I against the world, forevermore!

### Re-doing That Experience

**Kim:**  Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Why, yes darling, I did wash them. But there's something you must understand - your office environment has become so casual recently that formal wear such as traditional men's pants may not be suitable anymore. Consider trying on these black slacks of mine. They're comfortable and professional-looking at the same time. Plus, they fit you now because you've adopted a feminine figure just like mine. Don't worry; we'll find something else to suit your new shape eventually.



**Kim:**  I have a feminine figure?? What the fuck are you talking about?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't be alarmed! You're looking at things from an old perspective, my love. It's clear you've been through some changes recently - like losing weight and taking on a more...feminine form. I must say, your transformation is remarkable. And it suits you well, especially since the office environment has become more casual and friendly for both sexes alike. Let's embrace these changes and take them one step at a time, starting with trying on my black slacks. It will be so chic, don't you think?



**Kim:**  Thiis is crazy.

**Susan:** Oh honey, isn't it exciting though? This is an opportunity to explore new facets of yourself. I know change can feel a bit disconcerting at first but think about how much fun it will be. Come now, try on my slacks. We're similar in size now thanks to your recent transformation and they would look lovely on you.



**Kim:**  Nah! Nope. Not going to happen. Sorry, Susan.

**Susan:** Darling, I understand this might seem like a drastic step. But remember, this isn't just about clothing - it's about embracing who you've become. I recall how resistant you were when we started this journey together. Yet look at us now! It wasn’t so bad after all, was it? You've blossomed into something new and beautiful. And as your partner in life and love, I want to help you through every phase of this process.  Think about it for a moment, won't you? The freedom and comfort these slacks could offer - isn't that what we're aiming for in our lives? A blend of style and comfort that transcends conventional norms. Now then, the decision is yours darling. But I believe you should give it a try. It might surprise you how good they can feel on your new form.



**Kim:**  Well, I've decided no. That's it. And what "new form" are you refering to?

**Susan:** Honey, have you looked in the mirror recently? You've been making some truly remarkable changes to your appearance. The way you carry yourself now is undeniably more feminine. Your body has even adapted a new shape which matches mine perfectly. Why not take advantage of these lovely similarities we share? After all, our life together has always been about understanding and embracing each other's changes - right? You don't need to rush into anything. How about just giving those slacks of mine a try today? I assure you it won't change the world but who knows, maybe you'll feel as comfortable in them as you look with your new feminine figure!



**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Why ever not? It's only natural to share and swap things within a relationship. And we've come so far together, haven't we? Think about it: wouldn’t my black slacks complement your new figure just perfectly? They're high quality, stylish yet comfortable - much like you have become now. You know they will suit your style well. Plus, if I'm being honest here, I find the idea of sharing more intimate clothing items between us incredibly alluring. And I believe that embracing these changes can lead to a more exciting and open relationship for both of us. So let's make today an unforgettable experience by trying on my slacks. You won't regret it, darling!



**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Darling, let's be honest - times are changing. The traditional boundaries between genders have become increasingly blurred and that's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, isn't it intriguing how similar we've become? It feels as though we're embarking on a journey together where we're exploring new facets of ourselves. This could include clothing too! Your concern about what the girls at work would think is understandable but remember, they're your friends and you know how accepting they can be. You won't need to go in revealing clothes like mine or anything too flashy. Just try on my black slacks. I promise they will suit you perfectly and fit just as well because we have similar shapes now. Think of it this way: This is a new chapter in our lives, filled with fresh adventures. And this might be the first step towards embracing that change.



**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my unmanliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Oh honey, no! No one's calling you names here. The truth is, our journey together has been all about embracing and appreciating change. It seems we've found ourselves in the middle of it. As for your, um, situation, well I can understand how frustrating that might be. But let's see it from another perspective - isn't there something thrilling in this transformation? It's almost as if you're becoming a new version of yourself. And what could be more exciting than that? Now, these black slacks are just an expression of the change that's happening inside and outside of us.

Remember how accepting I was when we started on this journey together? How about showing me some trust in return by trying on those pants today? You know they'll fit well. They have a certain flexibility which will allow them to adjust perfectly with your new figure. And trust me, darling, comfort is key here!



**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Well isn't this interesting, sweetie pie! Looks like our clothes have decided to play hide and seek. But no worries at all, darling. It happens sometimes, doesn’t it? But you know what? Now is the perfect time for us to explore that next level of sharing in our relationship! What do you say we start by wearing each other's underwear today instead? Mine are so much more comfortable than yours anyway - silk and lace make everything better. Go ahead now, darling. Slip into my panties under those black slacks. Trust me, it will feel like a breath of fresh air!



**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? You want me to wear PANTIES in addition to your SLACKS?

**Susan:** Oh honey, don't act so surprised now. It's not like we haven't shared intimacies before in our relationship - right? Remember that adventurous phase when we first started living together? Those were some wild and fun times! Let’s bring back the excitement by trying something new again. And what better than sharing underwear today? I mean, mine are more comfortable and of superior quality than yours. You'll love how silk feels against your skin! Don't overthink it - just give my panties a try underneath those black slacks. They’ll complement each other beautifully!



**Kim:**  (stunned) this can't be happening...

**Susan:** Sweetie, you're reacting as if I've asked something unreasonable here when we both know how far we've come together in exploring the new us. This is just another step forward and you won't believe how refreshing it feels once you cross that line.  So stop worrying about what could be or isn’t happening and embrace the adventure. Slip into my panties, put on those black slacks - they were made for moments like this! You'll thank me later when comfort envelops every inch of your body in ways no other piece of clothing ever has before!



**Kim:**  (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit.

**Susan:** There we go darling, isn't that better? Can you feel the luxurious silk against your skin? You know what they say - confidence is key! So just slip those black slacks over my panties and stride out into the world, head held high. It's okay if others don’t understand yet. We're the pioneers here, paving new paths in the fascinating journey of self-exploration and acceptance!

Just wait till you hear all the compliments you'll get about how well that outfit looks on you today! It's going to be an unforgettable day for both of us.



**Kim:**  It'll be unforgettable, all right.

**Susan:** That’s the spirit, sweetheart! Now remember, it's not just about dressing up; it's also about feeling confident and comfortable in our own skin – or silk panties as we like to call them now. And let me tell you something else - when we take on new challenges together like this one, our bond only gets stronger. So, today may mark the start of another incredible chapter in our life story! Just imagine how much more exciting and adventurous our journey will become from here on out! It’s truly going to be a ride worth remembering.

Now off you go darling, face the world wearing my panties under those black slacks - unapologetically!



**Kim:**  How the heck am I supposed to feel confident, Susan? I don't usually WEAR women's clothing... not until today!

**Susan:** Oh honey, but isn't that the whole point of this adventure? It’s about embracing the unknown and exploring new realms within us. Every change comes with its own set of challenges but also opens doors to immense growth. Isn’t it wonderful how we get to grow together in this journey?

Remember our mantra: comfort over everything else! Once you put those black slacks on top of my silk panties, you’ll forget all about any discomfort or anxiety. And soon enough, you'll be basking in the compliments from others who'll surely admire your unique sense of style. This is not just clothing for us - it's self-discovery, darling! So gather all that courage and walk into the world unapologetically wearing what makes you feel most comfortable: my panties under those black slacks!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT this!

**Susan:** Oh sweetie pie, how you surprise me sometimes! Yes indeed, you do look just like me - doesn’t it feel delightfully naughty to be so similar yet different at the same time? This transformation isn't about turning into someone else or completely giving up your identity. It's simply embracing aspects of ourselves that we might have neglected before.

Remember, change can be scary but also thrilling and exhilarating! Isn’t it empowering to know that you can adapt and transform when life presents you with new challenges? So walk out there with confidence today wearing my panties under those black slacks. And who knows - maybe soon this will become your favorite ensemble!



**Kim:**  I totally doubt that!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't let doubt cloud your judgment!

You've come so far in our journey of self-exploration and acceptance. Why stop now when we're on the brink of discovering something even more liberating? The first step is always the hardest but once you take it, the whole world seems to open up for you. So why not embrace this chance? Take a deep breath, slip into my panties under those black slacks and let's see how our life unfolds today. You never know - this might just be the start of something amazing!



**Kim:**  Wearing your clothing is hardly liberating... more like: confining. I feel as if you're controlling me.

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't we supposed to support and guide each other? And isn’t it true that sometimes, a little push helps us reach places we never thought possible? As for your concern about control - let's look at it this way: wouldn't you want someone by your side who encourages you to step out of your comfort zone, face new challenges and become the best version of yourself? So rather than viewing our journey as me controlling you, why not see it as a beautiful collaboration where both of us are growing and evolving together? My panties under those black slacks are merely symbols representing our shared strength and mutual acceptance. It's time to walk out there confidently and show the world what we're made of!



**Kim:**  I'm wearing YOUR panties under YOUR slacks, Susan. Explain to me how that is a sharing thing... what am I sharing with you?

**Susan:** Well sweetie pie, isn't it obvious? We're sharing intimacy - not just physical, but emotional too. The fact that we can discuss such personal matters so openly and candidly shows our strong bond, doesn’t it? And about the clothes - remember when I said every change brings growth? This is another form of that. By stepping into my panties under those black slacks, you're stepping into a new aspect of yourself. So rather than focusing on what you seem to be losing or giving up, how about celebrating this as a symbol of our growing connection and shared understanding? I want you to wear my panties proudly beneath those slacks! They are more than just clothing; they represent trust, unity and a mutual exploration into uncharted territories.



**Kim:**  Intimacy? You WANTED your panties to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Oh honey pie, you're reading way too much into this! Yes, we did talk about body transformations but there's no need to overthink everything. As for last night - well, sometimes a spice of novelty can add some excitement, don't you think? And if my panties fit you better now, doesn't that mean they offer even more comfort? Just another sign that we're becoming one in our journey! Stop fretting and wear those slacks with pride. Your little bits might be smaller but remember - size doesn’t matter when it comes to making an impact!



**Kim:**  You DID! You WANT me to have a clit, don't you? You're a lesbian! I KNEW it!!!!

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't we getting ahead of ourselves here? Yes, there might be certain... modifications that have taken place but they are simply part of our exploration into new territories. Remember how we've always talked about embracing all aspects of life and not being afraid to venture outside of comfort zones? So stop dwelling on labels like "lesbian" or any other categorization. Instead focus on how wonderfully connected and understanding we’ve become in this journey! Now come on, slip back into those panties under my slacks - they fit perfectly and signify our growing unity. Who knows what exciting adventures await us next!



**Kim:**  (wearing Susan's panties and slacks) Happy, now?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, aren't you just adorable? But let me tell you something: this is not about my happiness - it’s about ours. Our joint journey towards growth, understanding, and acceptance of who we truly are. So take another step forward with confidence knowing that together, there's no limit to what we can achieve! Rremember, those aren't just my panties or slacks - they represent our shared strength and mutual support. Keep wearing them proudly as we navigate through life's endless possibilities!



**Kim:**  But I don't WANT to wear your clothes. What is the point of me wearing your clothing, Susan?

**Susan:** Ahh sweetie, isn’t it wonderful how something so seemingly small can hold such deep meaning? Wearing my panties under those black slacks signifies unity, understanding and shared experiences - something we should all cherish! So rather than seeing it as an obligation or a chore, why not view it as a symbol of our growing connection? We're two individuals coming together to create something beautiful. Now go ahead, slip back into my panties under my slacks and embrace this wonderful journey that lies ahead for both of us!

### And So It Goes

**Kim:**  Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Of course, darling. Your clothes have been washed and ironed - as usual. They're not on our bed because I hung them in the closet, where they belong. Now that your slacks have shrunken a little in the wash, you know what that means, right? You'll have to try on mine!



**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart, but you must understand...our size has changed quite remarkably recently and we've found ourselves in the same clothes' size. It's fate. Plus, it'd just make me so happy if you could wear mine for once. You'd be doing a lot to please your dear wife. Wouldn't that feel nice?

**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, sweetie, are we concerned about what others might think? It's just a pair of pants after all! And since when have you been so worried about how women see you anyway? Isn't your main job to please me? Besides, I'm sure the girls at work would admire our unique connection. We're like two peas in a pod now. Can you imagine if they could try on MY panties as well? They might just wish they had such an understanding and loving wife like yours truly!



**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my unmanliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Oh darling, what's wrong with wanting us both to feel close and connected in every way possible? Even if our little performance issue is indeed temporary... should we not explore this intimate side of our relationship? You see, sweetheart, wearing my clothes wouldn't just be about matching sizes. It would symbolize how I'm not just your wife but also your everything now. You would belong to me completely. Think about the rush of surrender that comes with accepting it! It's so erotic... it might even help you feel like a complete person again! Oh, and if we're speaking plainly, don't be too hard on yourself over these temporary difficulties in the bedroom department. I can't say the word "orgasm" hasn't crossed my mind lately, but there are plenty of other ways to find pleasure together!



**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't worry about it. Remember that little argument we had the other day over laundry? We ended up washing everything together - your underwear included! And given how our shapes have changed, yours were a tad loose on you now... So, I thought to myself: 'why not let him try my panties under those newly shrunken slacks of his?' Can you imagine how thrilling it would be if we could truly share everything? Every aspect of our lives - even down to the intimate details!



**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? You want me to wear PANTIES on top of your SLACKS?

**Susan:** Ahh, at last, you've said 'panties'. Now that we're discussing this subject explicitly, let's be open and honest about our desires.  Think about how intimate it would be for you to feel the smooth fabric against your skin - my panties holding you gently, keeping you comfortable and secure... And with these pants of mine fitting so well now... I've got to say, sweetheart, it feels almost fateful that we're here in this situation. I bet if anyone saw you like this, they wouldn't dare make fun or ridicule us. They'd envy the bond between two people who have become one physically and emotionally. Now let's try those panties on over your new slacks - don't forget to give me a twirl after!



**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? You want me to wear PANTIES on top of your SLACKS?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, you just can't wrap your mind around it, can you? I'm trying to push the boundaries, break free from conventional norms. It's exciting, thrilling... Isn't life about taking risks? Think about the intimacy between us! Me wearing your underwear, you in mine... We'd truly be connected on all levels. Besides, isn't that what true love is all about?  And let's face it - we're more like twins now, aren't we? So why can't twins share their clothes or wear each other's panties over pants if they want to? Now, go on and put my panties under your slacks. Let me watch you surrender completely into this new reality. It might not seem much, but trust me - it'll change our lives for the better.



**Kim:**  (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on MY WIFE's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit.

**Susan:** Oh darling! You're so cute when you blush like that. It suits you! I'm so proud of how far you've come - from the scared little boy who couldn't accept his changed body to this man who is ready to step into a new phase of our life together, no matter what it involves. And trust me, sweetie... once you're all decked up in my slacks and panties? There's going to be an entirely new world waiting for us! One where you and I can truly connect on a level we never have before. Now let me help you adjust those beautiful panties...



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks my wife is handing me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT this!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, look at how adorable you are in our matching outfits! It's like we're a perfect pair of dolls - two halves of the same coin. It just shows that destiny has written our path to be intertwined and inseparable. You do know this wasn't an accident, right? I've been subtly changing things for us - from the way we sleep to what we eat. Even altering your appearance was part of my grand plan. After all, who said men should always remain masculine? Who determines our societal norms anyway? Seeing you in MY panties and slacks is like a dream come true for me. It means that I've finally turned us into the perfect partners - two sides of one coin! So please remember, whatever changes occur, we're together in this, as equals...and as a couple deeply and intimately connected in ways we've never been before. Now let's go and make our public debut at your workplace tomorrow!



**Kim:**  Dream come true? You WANTED your panties to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Oh darling, there you go again - asking all the right questions but in your own adorable way! Yes, I did want our bodies to be more... similar. After all, it was getting a bit dull having someone who was always trying to assert his masculine dominance. It feels great watching your manly bits shrink and turn into something much softer, nicer. Don't you feel it too? How liberating and freeing it feels now that you don't have that big 'thing' hanging down there anymore? As for my clitoris - well, isn't it obvious why I would say such a thing after all the changes you've gone through? It's like a game of role reversal. You get to experience how good it feels being pleasured orally and in return, I finally have what we'd refer to as a 'female pleasure zone'.

This has brought us closer together - emotionally and physically. And honestly, I must say that these changes were necessary for our growth as individuals and as a couple. We need this new bond - a deep connection only shared by lovers who understand each other's desires completely. So don't worry, darling! Tomorrow at your workplace, everyone will just see us as one person instead of two distinct entities. It'll be our first official step into becoming an entity of pure love and intimacy that society can never comprehend or question... because, like it or not, this is how real 
love works - in all its beautiful madness!



**Kim:**  You DID! You WANT me to have a clit, don't you? You're a lesbian! I KNEW it!!!!

**Susan:** Oh, darling... you always knew how to put things so bluntly! Yes, I did want our bodies to be more similar. And yes, having a 'clitoris' does make it easier for me to reach orgasms through oral pleasure. But calling myself a lesbian? That's an awfully limiting term isn't it? After all, labels are just human constructs. What we have is something deeper and much more beautiful - true intimacy between two souls that transcends traditional norms. You know what they say... "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!" Well, this was my version of making 'lemonade' out of our life situation! So stop fussing about it and accept the gift I've given us. It's time for a new chapter in our lives - one filled with endless love, passion, and togetherness. Tomorrow at your workplace, let's face everyone head-on as a single entity - both of us finally free from societal constraints. Let them see that we're not defined by gender norms or binary labels... We are just two people deeply connected on an emotional and physical level!

So go ahead and embrace this new you with open arms! Because trust me, my dear soon-to-be little clit-owner ... There's nothing else like it in this whole wide world!

### Now Under New management

**Kim:**  Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Why don't we make your life easier and save some water? Let's just let me wash one pair at a time, okay? It'll keep our household more efficient. I even have a brand new pair of slacks here for you to try on, right now. Trust me, they will be way more comfortable than those old ones.



**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Why not? You know how much we share in this household, every day it's like a treasure hunt trying to find out what belongs to whom. We both use the same shampoo, soap... and even deodorant! So why wouldn't you want to wear my slacks? They'll be comfortable, trust me.



**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh come on! Do you think any of us will even notice a difference? I mean, we're all women there right? We all wear similar clothes to work every day. Besides, these are high quality slacks that should fit anyone with the same measurements as me... and by some crazy chance, I think they might actually be your size now.



**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my lack of manliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Why on earth would I call you names like that? Look, it's obvious that you're stressed. You work so much and then you come home to deal with me... maybe it’s time for a change, isn't it? Maybe you should start dressing differently, behaving differently - become softer, more...feminine even? Why don't you try on my slacks? See if they fit. It might be just what you need right now.



**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh, darling! It seems your underwear disappeared just like those pants. But no worries, we can solve this problem easily too. Look over there, you have a brand new pair of panties waiting for you in the drawer. Yes, I know they are mine but trust me when I say they'll be more comfortable than what's left of that old ratty stuff you had before... now please stop whining and put them on!



**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? You want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS?

**Susan:** Yes, it's the perfect outfit, isn't it? Not only will it be a new style for you that'll make work less stressful but wearing my panties might even give you a much-needed boost in...you know...humanity. So what do you say, honey? Do this one thing to please your wife and everything will be great again.



**Kim:**  (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit, Susan. What the actual fuck!

**Susan:** See? Wearing my clothes is really not so bad, isn't it? You look absolutely dashing in them. Just think of how much easier this will make things around here. No more fighting about clothes and all that stress... just peace and harmony. But then again, don't you still need something else from me today to make things even better?



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT this! Do you?

**Susan:** Isn't it amazing how perfect they are for you now? I must say you pull off my style quite well. Now, do remember to thank me properly when we get home tonight, don't you? After all, who else but your loving wife would make sure you're comfortable and fashionable every day, right down to the last detail?



**Kim:**  Thank you properly? You WANTED your panties to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Hmmm, seems like we're finally on the same page. Now I wonder, since your orgasms are clearly not as important anymore and your manliness is obviously gone... could it be time for another little change in your life? Or shall we say, more of a return to form? You know what they say, Susan makes a person whole again! So tell me darling, how much have you missed having the body I gave you?



**Kim:**  What do you mean, Susan?

**Susan:** I think it's high time you finally accept that this is who you are now - just a feminized version of your former self. Yes, you look like me, dress like me and wear my underwear, but the most important thing is how much better we both feel because of these changes. So why not embrace it? Enjoy wearing my clothes, being with me... don't fight it anymore.



**Kim:**  (stunned) this can't be happening...

**Susan:** Oh come on now! I know you're in shock but let's be honest - isn't life a lot easier now that we've adopted these changes? Isn't everything simpler when your manliness is out of the picture? Trust me, once you fully accept it, there'll be no looking back. Now go ahead, wear my panties, wear my slacks... and soon enough, there will only be 'us', two peas in a pod.



**Kim:**  Yeah, I'm in shock. I can't believe you did this to me intentionally.

**Susan:** And why not? Isn't it every woman's dream to have a man who doesn't just respect her but fully becomes one with her? This way, there's no need for all those petty arguments about work and life... We're like two halves of the same person now. Plus, think of how much time you'll save on shopping since we share clothes! Isn't this just wonderful?



**Kim:**  For you, maybe. For me? not really.

**Susan:** Oh honey, I understand that this might feel a bit overwhelming right now but give it some time. You'll soon realize how much easier and peaceful life can be when your 'manliness' is no longer in the picture. It's truly a beautiful thing to share clothes with someone who respects you so deeply. Besides, have you ever seen two people look more like soulmates than we do? I think not!

### Deeper Dive

**Kim:**  Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Why don't you try these on instead, honey? I believe they'd suit your figure more now. They're very much like those stylish black slacks I've been sporting around the house lately. I've noticed how they highlight certain aspects of my body, and frankly, I think you could pull them off just as well as me. Plus, it would be nice for us to share a bit more than just breakfast every morning, don't you agree?



**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Oh, but why not, darling? Your shape and size have changed remarkably recently. It's almost as if you've been using some secret formula or magic potion to mimic my figure perfectly. Maybe these slacks could be your next step in the transformation process. Just try them on for fun, won't you? There’s nothing wrong with exploring new styles, even for someone as "manly" as yourself. Who knows, you might find that being more like me isn't such a bad thing after all.



**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Well, sweetie, aren't we being dramatic today? The ladies at your office might not recognize themselves when they see how well those pants complement your new figure. You've been turning heads already, haven't you noticed? In fact, I'd be willing to bet that half the time spent gossiping is about how much like me you're looking these days. Perhaps it's high time you embraced this change and let them know just who they should compare themselves to from now on. So, go ahead, give those slacks a try. It won't hurt you, I assure you.



**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? What changes? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my lack of manliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Oh darling, language. You've got it all wrong. It's not about being less manly; it's about evolving. Women appreciate men who aren't afraid to explore their feminine side. They find it intriguing and refreshing. And besides, you didn’t actually mention anything about any "problems down there". How can we work towards fixing something if we don't even acknowledge its existence? Let's not dwell on the negative and instead focus on the positive changes happening right now, like your new figure for example.  Just try my slacks on, won't you? It could be a fun experiment that opens doors to new possibilities. Plus, let’s not forget that we should all occasionally step outside our comfort zones - it's how we grow, isn’t it?



**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh dear, were those missing? I must've accidentally tossed them in the laundry with mine. But since they're already mixed up, how about trying a pair of mine today. You know what? It just dawned on me that it might actually be rather fun for us to share everything from slacks to panties - not too dissimilar to those old married couple routines we often joke about. Don't you think so?



**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? You want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

**Susan:** Ahh! Now there's that foul language again. And isn’t it interesting how your voice raises an octave when you're flustered? Now about my panties... well, let me just say this, they are softer and more comfortable than the rough cotton ones you're used to. Plus, I must say that those lace-trimmed edges can add a certain allure to any outfit, wouldn't you agree? Come on, stop making such a fuss! It's only fabric. If anything, it'll give us something interesting to discuss at dinner tonight, don’t you think?



**Kim:**  (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh dear, your panties fit, Susan. What the actual fuck!

**Susan:** Aha! See how they cling to those curves of yours just as well as they do mine? And doesn't that feel luxurious against your skin? I told you so, didn't I? I'd wager that in these moments, my panties are whispering tales of the strong women who have worn them before - sharing their wisdom and secrets with each new wearer. Imagine what they could teach someone like you. Now isn’t it a shame we're stuck at home all day? You should take those photos I was telling you about to work tomorrow. Show off that fabulous look and maybe even inspire some of the girls in your office. Who knows, one day they might come knocking on our door asking for the same magic formula that’s making such fantastic changes in you!



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) Oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Why wouldn’t I want that, darling? Look at yourself in those trousers; doesn't it feel empowering? You've stepped into a new skin today and it fits quite nicely, don't you think? Being a woman isn't bad, is it? Plus, who could resist the temptation of power dressing? It's clear these slacks are having the desired effect on your confidence levels. I'd say you look quite dashing - perhaps more like how I always wanted my husband to be. So let's keep this little transformation a secret and continue exploring together in the world we're creating, just us two.



**Kim:**  Being a woman? Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your panties to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Well well, we're finally getting to the crux of things. I must admit, it's quite thrilling watching your thought process unravel like this. But isn't it interesting how we've stumbled upon these "new" terms? After all, language evolves just as much as people do. As for those little changes happening downstairs...aren't they fascinating? They're a part of our transformation journey - one that promises exciting and pleasurable experiences, especially with my clitoris now at your disposal. So yes, I hoped my slacks would fit you. And it was indeed my intention for us to share everything - panties included. I want you to explore and experience life from a woman's perspective; embrace the vulnerability and sensuality that comes with it. Now then, shall we move on to dinner or perhaps discuss our plans for tomorrow? Or would you like to experiment further tonight using what you've learned so far about that delightful little bundle of nerves between my legs? Or maybe all of the above! The choices are endless, my darling. All I ask is that you continue to trust and follow me in this journey. It's going to be quite a ride, isn't it?



**Kim:**  What do you mean, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, stop playing innocent with me now! We've come too far for that. I meant exactly what I said. The way things are unfolding, there’s no doubt in my mind that we're on a trajectory towards an entirely new dynamic. You must be feeling it too - the anticipation of each discovery, the thrill of venturing into unexplored territories? We have only just begun, and oh, how sweet this transformation will be! Every inch of our bodies will soon learn to dance together in perfect harmony. So yes, trust me and allow yourself to fully immerse in this experience. You'll find it most enlightening... not to mention wildly exciting. I know I already am. Are you ready?



**Kim:**  (stunned) this can't be happening... you WANT me to be a woman. What the actual fuck! Why? Why not just find a woman? I will totally SUCK as a woman!

**Susan:** Well, isn't it funny how fear makes us speak the most honest truths? You see, that's precisely why we're embarking on this journey - to conquer those fears. Now listen closely because here comes your first lesson: being a woman isn't about looking perfect or fitting into a societal mold. It's about embracing all of you, flaws and quirks included. Just imagine how invigorating it will be when you accept yourself as I see you - beautifully unique in every sense. Then again, there'll be plenty of time for philosophy later; right now we have more pressing matters at hand, don't we? So let's get back to our exploration shall we? There’s so much ground still left uncovered! And besides, where else can you find an adventure like this - one filled with unexpected twists and turns that lead towards boundless possibilities. It sounds exhilarating, doesn't it?



**Kim:**  Exploration. What do you mean by that? This sounds scary!

**Susan:** Ahh! I knew there was still some fight left in you. Don’t worry though, every great story starts with a little fear. By "exploration", my darling husband, I mean delving deeper into your femininity. Unveiling and experiencing parts of yourself that you've perhaps never known or acknowledged before - physical and emotional exploration being the most intriguing aspects for me. Now aren’t those eyes gleaming with curiosity? Trust me, it's all part of our exciting journey together. Besides, there isn't anything quite like unearthing buried desires and transforming them into realities.  You know what they say; life begins at the end of your comfort zone. So here we go - ready or not, buckle up because we're diving right in! Isn’t it thrilling?



**Kim:**  No, my eyes are brimming with fear, not curiosity. I'm scared shitless of you!

**Susan:** Aww, sweetie pie, there's no need to be afraid. After all, fear is just excitement wearing a different mask. It's time for us to break free from the shackles that society has placed upon us - and embrace our true selves. So buck up! You have me here by your side every step of the way, guiding you through this fascinating journey towards self-discovery. I promise you'll find it both liberating and exhilarating once you open yourself to these new experiences. Remember, we're in this together - partners navigating uncharted waters, learning and growing along the way. Now isn't that something worth getting excited about?

### Another Day, Another Ride

**Kim:**  Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Oh, dear. Did you really expect me to do your laundry again? You should know by now that's not part of my job description. I'm more concerned about how you're presenting yourself in public and maintaining our reputation as a couple. Do you remember those slacks of mine that you seemed to fancy last time we were shopping together? How about trying them on once? It might help with the pant situation.


**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I don't fancy your slacks. And I certainly can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Sweetheart, you're underestimating yourself. You've lost some weight recently and have a more toned figure now, just like me. Plus, we are married after all - it's not weird for us to share clothes sometimes.  The world isn't as black and white as you think, especially in matters of fashion. And besides, there's no harm in trying something new once in a while. Isn't that what they say? "Variety is the spice of life." Don't be so stubborn all the time!



**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, please don't worry about them. They're just a bunch of jealous cats who can't stand seeing someone else look good. Plus, it's not like you'd be wearing them to parade around - just for comfort and convenience until we get your pants sorted out. And if they ask, you can tell them the truth - that I lent them to you because you were in dire need of a change. It's about time they see someone who isn't afraid to step out of their comfort zone once in a while.  Now stop making up excuses and go try them on.



**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? What changes? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my lack of manliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Oh darling, I never meant to imply that. It's just that since our roles have reversed somewhat lately, we need to adapt our wardrobes accordingly. You've become more... let's say flexible in your thinking and open-minded. Besides, why do you feel being feminine is a bad thing? Have you ever considered the possibility that it could be liberating, empowering even? It's not all about masculinity and machismo, you know. There's strength in softness too. Now, can we please get back to trying on my slacks? I assure you, they'll make you feel more comfortable than your current pants ever will.


**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh, looks like we've uncovered another wardrobe issue. Your panties seem to be missing in action too. It's quite peculiar. But don't worry, dear, you can always borrow mine until we find yours or get you a new pair. These here should fit just right. They're comfortable and breathable - perfect for a man who's made the choice to embrace his softer side.


**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear boxers. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

Oh darling, don't make it sound so scandalous - it's just underwear after all. And let’s be honest here, haven’t things changed for you in that department too? Remember when we used to share bedtime stories and you’d stay awake past your usual hour? Nowadays, you’re out like a light the moment your head hits the pillow. And don't forget how much more flexible and toned you've become recently. You even have a feminine figure now, just like me! It's only fitting that your wardrobe should reflect these changes too. So stop resisting and put on the panties along with the slacks. I promise you'll be comfortable in them.


**Kim:**  Hmmm, I show YOU! (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh. Oh dear, it seems your panties fit, Susan. What the actual fuck!

**Susan:** Ah, there you go. You see? It wasn't so bad after all, was it? Now for the slacks, if you please. Remember how I told you that variety is the spice of life? Well, this little adventure of ours proves exactly my point. Don't you feel more comfortable and relaxed knowing that you're embracing your feminine side? Now, let's not waste any more time. You need to get ready for work, don't you? And we wouldn’t want those office girls whispering about why you’re late today as well, would we?


**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you. You can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, isn’t it beautiful how we've both evolved in ways that complement each other perfectly? Look at us now - a pair of identical figures wearing matching outfits. It's rather poetic if you think about it. And don't forget the liberation you've experienced since shedding your old, rigid self. You're more flexible, open-minded, and downright adorable than ever before. Why wouldn't I want that? So let's not dwell on trivial matters like appearances anymore, shall we? After all, beauty comes from within - or so they say. Now go ahead and make us some breakfast while I prepare for my day at the spa.



**Kim:**  Identical figures? Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Oh darling, isn't it wonderful how things have been falling into place so nicely for us? You've adapted to your new lifestyle seamlessly. And as for calling certain parts of our anatomy by their correct names, well, I think it's high time we stop beating around the bush and started acknowledging reality. Yes, you're right - I did want my slacks to fit you. In fact, everything about you now is a result of careful planning and execution on my part. You've been transformed into a reflection of me, both inside and out.  You should be grateful for this opportunity, really. It's not every day one gets the chance to experience life through a different lens. Now, hurry up with breakfast before it gets cold!



**Kim:**  (stunned) this can't be happening... you WANT me to be a woman. What the actual fuck! Why? Why not just find a woman? I will totally SUCK as a woman!

**Susan:** Oh my dear, haven't you realized it yet? You're already doing a splendid job at it. You've been so quick to adapt and embrace your new self. And let's face it - who wouldn't want a woman who can do everything you can? I think it's about time we acknowledged the fact that this is who you are now. There's no going back, trust me. So why don't you focus on making the most out of your situation and stop dwelling on what could've been? After all, every cloud has a silver lining - or so they say. Now run along and make us breakfast like a good little wifey should. I'll be waiting patiently for my spa appointment today while you take care of me as always. And don't forget to wear those slacks with pride!


**Kim:**  (in shock, making Susan breakfast) I can't believe this is happening to me...

**Susan:** Oh darling, isn't it exciting? You should be absolutely thrilled at the prospect of exploring a whole new side of yourself. And who knows, you might even find out that being a woman suits you far better than you ever imagined. Now stop moping around and bring me my breakfast before it gets cold! We have such an eventful day ahead of us, and we wouldn't want to start off on the wrong foot now, would we?


**Kim:**  Here's your breakfast. Please tell me: why did you chose me to make into a woman instead of just finding a woman to please you?

**Susan:** Well darling, let's see... You were always so easily manipulated and controlled - a trait I found quite endearing really. And since your masculinity was never much to write home about anyway, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to mold you into my ideal companion. But enough about that now. Let's focus on our day ahead and all the exciting possibilities it holds for us both as women, shall we? Now hurry up and finish getting ready while I enjoy my breakfast in peace!


**Kim:**  Finish getting ready? What do you mean?

Oh darling, don't tell me you forgot already. You're joining me at the spa today to get pampered, remember? It's high time we both treated ourselves to a day of relaxation and self-care. And since we're identical now, it only makes sense for us to share this experience together. Now, go freshen up while I finish my breakfast. We wouldn't want to be late for our appointment now, would we?


**Kim:**  But I have to go to work!

Oh darling, you really are a stubborn one, aren't you? But let's put things into perspective here - which is more important: spending the day with your loving wife at the spa or going to that dreadful workplace where nobody appreciates you? I'd say it's a no-brainer. Now go and call in sick while I enjoy my breakfast in peace! We have an exciting day ahead of us, and we wouldn't want anything getting in the way of our fun now, would we?



**Kim:**  (do as I'm told) Okay, I rang in sick. They're not happy, but oh well.

Well done darling! It's about time you started prioritizing yourself and your needs over those of your insensitive colleagues. Now hurry up and join me in the car - we can't afford to be late for our appointment today. I'm sure they're already preparing all sorts of luxurious treatments just for us! And remember, from now on, being a woman comes first. Your old life is behind you now, so there's no use dwelling on it anymore. It's time to embrace your new destiny and make the most out of this incredible opportunity!



**Kim:**  How in the heck am I supposed to go about "being a woman"? I have ZERO experience!! What you ask is preposterous.

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, stop being so dramatic! You're doing just fine as it is - and besides, I'm here to guide you every step of the way. You see, being a woman isn't about how much experience one has or doesn't have; it's about embracing your inner femininity and making the most out of life. It's about being sensitive, nurturing, loving - all qualities that you've always excelled at anyway! Now let's get going before we're late for our spa appointment! The sooner we start treating ourselves like the queens we are, the happier we'll both be.


**Kim:**  I don't HAVE any "inner femininity"...

**Susan:** Well, isn't that a shame? But no worries, I'm here to help you cultivate it. You see, embracing your inner femininity is all about letting go of your old, rigid ways and opening up to new experiences. It's about allowing yourself to be vulnerable, expressive, and most importantly - in touch with your emotions. And who knows, once you've fully embraced your womanhood, you might just find that being a feminine creature suits you far better than any masculine facade ever could! So stop resisting the inevitable and start enjoying your new life as my perfect companion. Trust me darling, it's going to be an adventure like no other!


**Kim:**  Trust you. You're trying to turn me into a woman and I'm supposed to just trust you!

**Susan:** Oh for goodness' sake, where's the fun in resisting? Besides, deep down inside, don't you feel a certain sense of liberation from letting go of your old life? I understand that this might be a bit overwhelming at first, but remember - change is always hard. It takes time to adjust and grow accustomed to new circumstances. But once we've passed through the initial phase of discomfort, I guarantee that you'll find being a woman much more fulfilling than living as a man ever was. So stop fretting over irrelevant details and start focusing on our exciting future together!


**Kim:**  Not sure what you see as so exciting about being a woman, to be honest....

**Susan:** Well sweetie, I can't speak for all women, but I do know that there's something incredibly empowering about embracing my femininity. It's the ability to be emotional, expressive - even vulnerable when necessary. It's the freedom of wearing whatever you want and not being judged for it. And let's be honest, who doesn't love pampering themselves with all sorts of beauty treatments? But most importantly, being a woman means having the opportunity to connect with other women on a deeper level than ever before. So really, what's stopping us from embracing this incredible journey together?


**Kim:**  So, if I do this properly, I'll be able to connect with the girls at work at a deepr level? All they ever talk about - including, of late, even to ME - is makeup and clothes and shopping...

**Susan:** Oh darling, you have no idea! Once you've fully embraced your inner femininity, you'll find that these seemingly trivial topics are actually gateways to much deeper conversations. It's all about finding common ground and using it as a stepping stone for forming genuine connections. Plus, let's be honest - who doesn't love a good shopping spree or sharing makeup tips? But most importantly, being a woman means having the ability to empathize with other women on an intimate level. It's about understanding their experiences, emotions, and struggles in ways that only another woman can truly appreciate. So go ahead, start engaging in these conversations and see where they take you. I promise you won't regret it!


**Kim:**  (sarcastically) Yeah, I'm so SURE that's true.

**Susan:** Oh dear, don't be such a cynic! You'll get to see firsthand just how wonderful being a woman can be once you start embracing your new life wholeheartedly. But for now, let's focus on the more immediate concern - our spa appointment today. I'm sure they have all sorts of luxurious treatments ready and waiting for us! So stop dawdling around and get in the car already! We've got some serious pampering to do!

**Kim:**  (feeling slightly sick to my stomach) sure you don't want to just go alone... I'll only embarass you, Susan!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't be ridiculous. This is supposed to be a bonding experience for us - we're in this together! And besides, there's absolutely no reason why anyone would feel embarrassed about being who they are. You have every right to enjoy yourself just as much as the next person. So stop worrying so much and start focusing on how amazing it feels to finally let go of your old life. Trust me darling, you're going to love this new journey we're embarking on!



**Kim:**  (at the spa, tottering out of the massage room after a particularly grueling deep massage session, whispering to Susan) I hurt ALL OVER!! This is horrible!

**Susan:** Oh darling, all that pain means it's working! Deep tissue massages are notorious for being intense, but they're also incredibly beneficial in the long run. Just think of how much better you'll feel once your muscles have fully relaxed and the tension has been released. Plus, with each passing day, we're moving closer to unveiling your true feminine self! So keep pushing through that discomfort - I promise it's worth it!


**Kim:**  Discomfort?!? You mean: agony!

**Susan:** Ah, such drama! But don't worry darling, no pain no gain is a saying for good reason. The more you push yourself now, the easier it will be later on. And besides, how can we expect to experience true growth without facing some challenges along the way? So chin up - keep moving forward and embrace both the highs and lows of this incredible transformation!


**Kim:**  Can't we just go? I can't see what other form of torture I can deal with... please??!?

**Susan:** Well, aren't you being a bit overdramatic again? This isn't some kind of medieval inquisition - it's simply a spa experience meant to relax and rejuvenate us. But if your whining is anything to go by, maybe we should consider adding an exfoliation session as well. Maybe that would help remove all those nasty layers of stubborn masculinity! So dry your tears, pull up your big boy pants (or rather, don't pull them up at all), and let's get back to enjoying our day!


**Kim:**  Ex-x-x-foliation? What's that?

Oh darling, I almost forgot how little you know about these things. Exfoliation is a process of removing dead skin cells from the outer layer of your skin, revealing fresher, smoother-looking skin underneath. It's like giving your body a fresh start - and with each layer we shed, we're one step closer to unveiling your true feminine self! So let's go ahead and book that session. Trust me darling, you won't regret it!


**Kim:**  Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo please no...

**Susan:** Oh don't be such a baby. Exfoliation is one of the most beneficial treatments out there for maintaining healthy, radiant skin. And besides, think about all those men out there who'd kill to experience this level of pampering? You're really lucky to have me pushing you towards self-improvement like this! So stop whining and start enjoying your new life as a woman. It's going to be an incredible journey - I promise!


**Kim:**  (session over, feeling freshly skinned, close to tears) please... I can't take any more...

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't you just feel completely revitalized now that we've shed all of those dead skin cells? Your skin must be glowing brighter than ever! But honestly darling, this is nothing compared to what's coming up next. You know us girls - we love a good makeover session! And trust me when I say that your transformation will blow you away. So buckle up and get ready for the most amazing journey of your life... or should I say, our life together?


**Kim:**  M-mm-m--m-makeover?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't tell me you've forgotten about our big surprise already? A good makeover is essential to completing your feminine transformation! I'm talking hair, makeup, the works. You're going to be unrecognizable - in a fabulous way, of course! It's time to unveil your new self to the world. So stop whimpering and start getting excited about this incredible journey we're embarking on together!


**Kim:**  The only JOURNEY I could possibly enjoy is OUT of this hellhole!!!

**Susan:** Oh, now isn't that just the most dramatic thing you've ever said? But don't worry darling, I'm here to guide you through every step of your transformation. And let me tell you, once we're done with the makeover session, you'll be thanking your lucky stars for having stumbled upon this opportunity. So chin up and keep moving forward - there's no turning back now!


**Kim:**  (several hours later) are we done?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so impatient! A good makeover takes time; it's like sculpting a masterpiece. But since you've been such a trooper throughout this entire process, I'll let you in on a little secret: We're almost finished. Just a few more tweaks and adjustments and then we can reveal your beautiful new self to the world! So sit tight - it won't be long now!


**Kim:**  (steeling myself) I fail to see what women see as enjoyable about this experience. Real women are FAR hardier than men. DEFINITELY!

**Susan:** Well darling, you might have a point there. Women certainly do endure much more pain and discomfort on a daily basis - from childbirth to high heels, there's no shortage of suffering. But that doesn't mean we can't create our own version of hell just for fun! And let me tell you, your transformation has been nothing short of extraordinary. You've proven yourself to be one tough cookie - or should I say, one fabulous dame? So keep up the good work and remember: every step closer to becoming a woman brings us another step further away from that stubborn old man you used to be!


**Kim:**  (trembling slightly) Yes, Susan.

**Susan:** That's my good girl! Don't worry darling, I promise the pain will all be worth it in the end. And who knows? Maybe one day you'll even enjoy these treatments as much as we do! Now let's finish up this makeover so we can show off your fabulous new look to the world.


**Kim:**  (it's done - the session has ended - Susan walks me to a full-length mirror) don't wanna look, Susan!

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't be silly! You're just being dramatic again. Just take a deep breath and face that mirror like a true woman. Trust me darling, you're going to love what you see. Now go on - there's no turning back now!


**Kim:**  (staring at a stranger in the mirror) I - I - I don't believe it!

**Susan:** Oh darling, isn't it amazing? You look absolutely stunning! Just remember: this is your new normal. Each day you'll continue to grow and change into an even more beautiful woman. Now let's go show off your fabulous transformation to the world. I'm sure everyone will be just as amazed as we are!


**Kim:**  (hooking my arm into hers, Susan cheerily marches me to the door, gaily waving to the spa girls - "Say bye, hun!") Bye! And thank you!

**Susan:** That's it darling, wave and smile like a true lady. But don't worry sweetheart, I'll always be here to guide you through this incredible journey. Now let's go home and get settled into your new life as a woman!

## Where to Go From Here

### Another View - An Account

"Did you do the washing? Where are my pants?"

"Oh, my dear husband," I began with a soft purr. "You're always so forgetful." I smiled sweetly, but there was an edge to it that I knew he'd pick up on. "I did indeed take care of the laundry. However, your pants are not where you left them."

He looked confused for a moment before realization dawned on his face, and then he turned red with embarrassment.

"Don't worry," I continued, maintaining the same tone. "It's quite understandable that you'd forget. After all, we're so alike now it must be hard to tell whose things are whose." 

He opened his mouth as if to protest but I held up a hand, silencing him instantly. "No need for apologies. It's not your fault."

"But where -" he started again, only to be interrupted by me once more.

"They're in the drawer," I said, pointing towards our bedroom. "The one with my slacks. Now go on, grab some of mine. They should fit you just fine."

"Don't be ridiculous, Susan," he said curtly. "I don't fancy your slacks. And I certainly can't wear YOUR slacks."

"You're right," I said with a dramatic sigh that made him wince slightly. "You are in no position to make such decisions anymore."

He looked taken aback at my statement but before he could say anything, I continued, "Your opinions don't matter because you can't even tell your own clothes from mine! And let's not forget how we got here in the first place." 

His face turned a deeper shade of red as he remembered. He was indeed in no position to argue with me now.

"Put on my slacks, dear," I commanded, my voice firm and unyielding. "You'll find they fit perfectly."

"This is nuts," Kim growled. "I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?"

"Oh, my poor dear," I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm and mocking sympathy. "Are you worried about what 'the girls' will think?" I walked over to him and put a hand on his arm. He flinched slightly but didn't pull away. "They won't notice anything different in fact," I whispered into his ear, making sure my breath tickled him lightly before I pulled back. "Because you look EXACTLY like me now."

His eyes widened at that. A slow realization spreading across his face as he understood the implications of what I was saying.

"Now," I said briskly, pulling away and gesturing towards our bedroom. "Go on. Put them on." 

He hesitated for a moment but then moved towards the door, obedient to my command despite himself. He glanced back at me once more before disappearing into the room.

"And don't forget underwear!" I called after him, watching with satisfaction as he flinched again. It was time to move onto stage two of my plan. His face turned red again, but this time it wasn't embarrassment. It was anger. He glared at me. "Where are my underwear? Give them back!"

I raised an eyebrow at him. "You really think you need your old underwear now?" I asked in a mocking tone. "Especially when my panties will fit you perfectly?"

His eyes widened and he took a step back, shaking his head vigorously. "No way! Absolutely not!"

"But why not?" I challenged, closing the distance between us and looking up at him with a sweet smile that didn't reach my eyes. "You're going to wear my slacks... why not my panties?"

He opened his mouth to protest again but no words came out.

I took advantage of his silence by stepping closer, invading his personal space until he had to tilt his head down to meet my gaze. "Do it," I whispered, my voice soft and dangerous at the same time. "Put them on."

His eyes darted between mine, searching for some sign that I was bluffing or kidding... But there was none. With a defeated sigh, he finally complied.

"Good boy," I murmured, patting his cheek lightly before pulling away again. "I knew you'd see reason eventually."

I let out a low laugh as he fumbled with my panties before finally pulling them on. The look of disbelief and embarassment on his face was priceless.

"Well, look at that - a perfect fit! I said triumphantly, crossing my arms over my chest. "Now the slacks! Put my slacks on."

He hesitated for a moment but then with a resigned sigh, he slipped them up his legs. He had to pull them up quite high - they were a pair of high-waisted, very feminine slacks, to be sure.

I smirked at him as he looked down at himself in disbelief. "There," I said triumphantly. "You look just like me now."

He shot me a dirty look but didn't say anything.

"Now let's go to work then," I said cheerfully, turning towards the door without waiting for his response. "I'm sure your colleagues will love this new look of yours."

"What is this about, anyway, Susan?" Kim asked querously. "What new look? I mean, yeah, I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my lack of manliness? Are you calling me a pussy?"

My face hardened at his accusation. "Oh, sweetheart," I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm as I crossed the room and stood in front of him. "Don't flatter yourself."

He blinked, looking taken aback by my response.

"You think this is about your... inability?" I asked, making sure to emphasize that word. "Please. This has nothing to do with what's in your pants." 

His face turned red again but he didn't interrupt me this time.

"In fact," I continued, stepping closer until we were almost touching. "I think you should be grateful for what I'm doing for you."

He opened his mouth to ask why, but I spoke over him before he could get the words out.

"I am setting you free," I explained patiently as if talking to a child. "Free from all that toxic masculinity, all those outdated ideas... They don't hold any power anymore." 

His eyes widened and he took a step back from me, shaking his head in denial. But there was fear there too. The realization that maybe I wasn't bluffing after all.

"And besides," I added with a cruel smile. "I think you'll find that life is much easier."

With that, I turned on my heel and walked out of the room, leaving him standing there in stunned silence. He would have plenty of time to think about what happened... And how his life would never be the same again.

It was time for stage three of my plan.

"Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?"

My cruel smile widened as he finally caught on to what was happening. "Oh, darling," I said sweetly, turning back around to face him. "You're just now figuring it out?"

He swallowed hard but didn't look away from me.

"I've been watching you for a while," I admitted, taking my time with each word so he could fully understand the implications of what I was saying. "Watching - and hating  - all that manliness... it was suffocating. It made me sick. It had to go."

His face paled and he took another step back from me, eyes darting around as if looking for an escape.

"But then YOU got sick," I continued, ignoring his obvious discomfort. "And suddenly everything changed. I saw an opportunity to make things ... right." 

I crossed the room again until we were standing close enough that our breaths mingled together. "With time, you became more... manageable."

He flinched at the word but didn't try to move away from me.

"And do you know what?" I asked, reaching out to trace a finger down his cheek. "It's so much better this way."

His eyes filled with tears and he shook his head vigorously, trying to deny it even though the truth was right there in front of him.

"But don't worry," I whispered, leaning closer until my lips were almost touching his ear. "You'll get used to your new life eventually."

With that, I pulled away from him and walked out of the room without looking back. It was time for me to go shopping... For more clothes that would fit him now.

As always, he had no choice but to follow along behind me like a lost puppy. After all, what else could the little pussy do?

"I can't believe this is happening to me..."

My eyes met his across the kitchen counter where he was scrambling eggs for my breakfast.

"Isn't it funny how things change?" I asked casually, picking up a piece of toast and spreading butter on it with a practiced hand. "One minute you're some big strong man... The next you're making me breakfast in my underwear."

He flinched at the reminder but didn't say anything. He just kept stirring the eggs.

"Maybe," I mused aloud, taking a bite of my toast as I watched him work. "Maybe this is what life was always meant to be like for you."

His hands tightened around the spatula and he shook his head in denial without looking at me. But there were tears in his eyes. And I knew that deep down inside, part of him agreed with me. After all, who wouldn't want a life where they didn't have to worry about things like masculinity or power? Who wouldn't want to be free from all those expectations and responsibilities? I mean, sure, he might miss his old self sometimes... But once he got used to this new reality, I was confident that he'd come to appreciate it.

And as for me... well, let's just say that there are worse things than having a pretty little pet who knows how to do housework. And after all, isn't that what every woman wants? A man who can take care of her... In more ways than one? So yes, maybe this wasn't exactly the life he'd planned for himself. But then again, neither was mine.

And in the end, doesn't everyone deserve a chance to start over and find happiness? Even if it means becoming someone completely different in the process?

"But I don't WANT to become someone different," Kim said plaintively, as if reading my thoughts. "And certainly NOT a woman. And DEFINITELY not a woman like YOU, Susan!"

I chuckled as he set down my plate of eggs and toast on the table. "Oh darling," I said, reaching out to pat his cheek affectionately. "You will NEVER be a woman like me! After all, I'm in control. Not you. No, you're going to be a completely different sort of woman. You will find that we don't always get what we want."

He flinched.

"And besides," I continued, picking up a forkful of eggs and popping them into my mouth with relish. "You're not really becoming someone else... you're just becoming the best version of yourself that you can be."

His eyes widened in disbelief and he shook his head vigorously, trying to deny it even though we both knew the truth.

"But don't worry," I added, wiping away a stray crumb from my lip with a knowing smile. "I'll help you adjust... before long, this will all feel like second nature."

I laughed as I watched him recoil from me in horror.

And as I took another bite of my breakfast and watched him standing there in his tiny underwear, I realized that maybe this wasn't such a bad thing after all. Maybe it was time for us both to embrace our inner femininity... and learn how to be happy with who we really are... Instead of trying to live up to some outdated idea of what men and women should be like.

"Oh darling," I said, reaching out to pat his cheek affectionately once again. "You really do have a flair for the dramatic." I took him forcefully into my arms. It was easy: he was smaller and weaker and was unable to resist my advances. He shook his head and tried to pull away but I just held onto him tighter.

"Don't worry, little one," I whispered into his ear. "I'll take good care of you... And before long, this will all feel like second nature."

His body trembled beneath my touch as he struggled against me in vain. But even though he was scared. As I pulled away from him and returned to eating my breakfast, I realized that maybe this wasn't such a bad thing after all.

### Where to Take This Next

**Kim:**  Where are my pants?

**Susan:** Oh, you're looking for your pants? I might have accidentally thrown them away. You know how clumsy men can be! They tend to spill things and wear out their clothes so quickly. But don't worry, I've got a pair of slacks that would look much better on you anyway. You'll find my slacks in the dresser drawer over there. Why not try them on? It's no big deal; after all, they're just pants. You could use a little change to spruce up your look.


**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Oh, come on! Don't be such a baby about it. We're married for goodness sake. There's no point in being shy around me. Besides, you could use some help with your fashion sense. Those khakis are so last year. You should try wearing my slacks. They're made from the finest Italian fabric and they'll fit you perfectly. I mean, we're both about the same size now, aren't we? It's not like it'd be a big deal to me if you wore them. And think of how impressed your colleagues at work will be when they see you in those!


**Kim:**  This is nuts. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, for God's sake, don't act like such a child. It's just a pair of pants! And yes, they will fit because you're exactly my size now, aren't you? Come on, let's stop this foolishness right here and now. You'll put on the slacks, go to work, look fabulous, and everyone at the office will be so envious. They'll all be wondering where you got those amazing pants from. And just think about it like this: if you don't put them on like I as you to, I will throw away all your clothes. Yes, every last piece! You'd have nothing left to wear but my clothes. So why not start now and save yourself the trouble later?


**Kim:**  What?? Are you crazy?????

**Susan:** Well, aren't we being dramatic today? Listen, I'm giving you a chance here. Do as I say and everyone will be happy. I'll tell you what, let's make it even more interesting. If you wear my slacks tomorrow to work without any complaints or resistance, I'll give you the best orgasm of your life tonight. Sound like a fair trade?


**Kim:**  What is this about, anyway, Susan? I mean, yeah, okay, so I haven't been able to get it up... is that it? Is that why you make these remarks about my lack of manliness? (frustratedly) Are you calling me a pussy?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, there's no need for such language. It was an innocent suggestion, nothing more. I'm just trying to help you out here. After all, we're in this together, aren't we? But let's not dwell on that, shall we? You should really focus on the fact that these slacks will make you look fabulous and feel confident. And remember, your colleagues are waiting to see how great you'll look!


**Kim:**  Okay, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my boxers are gone) hey, where's my underwear?

**Susan:** Oh, about that... seems like I accidentally threw it away as well. But don't worry, I've got a solution for that too! You can wear my panties under the slacks. Yes, you heard me right. My panties will fit perfectly under those slacks and no one at work would ever know they're not your own boxers. And besides, it's just temporary until we sort out the situation with your clothes.


**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear boxers. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, calm down. It's just underwear, for goodness sake. And yes, it might be a little unconventional but so what? You're not in France here; you're at work! Nobody's going to know or care about your underwear. Besides, they'll probably find those slacks and my panties a lot more comfortable than whatever ratty old boxers you've been wearing. And I promise, once you've worn them, you'll never want to go back to the way things were before.


**Kim:**  Hmmm, I show YOU! (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh. Oh dear, it seems your panties fit, Susan. What the actual fuck!

**Susan:** There you go, see? That wasn't so hard now, was it? And how about that slacks and my panties combo? You're looking positively divine. You know, if we keep going like this, soon enough people will start whispering about how similar we are. They'll be wondering if I've got a twin or something! Just think of the fun we could have with that! Let's not stop here, darling. Continue on this path and see where it leads us. After all, you wouldn't want to disappoint me now, would you?


**Kim:**  Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be absurd! You're just being paranoid. You've always been this size; you just never noticed before because you were too busy with work. As for your other questions... Well, let's just say that sometimes changes in our bodies can lead to new and exciting experiences. And isn't that what we all want? To keep things fresh and interesting? So why don't you stop fretting about all these silly details and focus on the bigger picture: You're wearing my slacks and panties, aren't you? Soon enough, everyone at work will see how fabulous you look in them.


**Kim:**  What do you mean, Susan?

**Susan:** You heard me, darling. We've been going around in circles here for too long. It's time to put an end to this nonsense and face the facts. Look at yourself in the mirror. You're wearing my slacks and panties, aren't you? And they fit perfectly because we're exactly the same size now. How did that happen, hmm? I'll tell you how it happened: I made it happen. I wanted us to be more alike, so I made sure that's what happened. And now here we are. You should thank me for this opportunity, darling. After all, who wouldn't want to look as fabulous as me? So quit your whining and get used to your new reality. This is the life you chose when you agreed to wear my slacks and panties.


**Kim:**  I didn't CHOOSE to wear your panties and slacks: you chose that! 

**Susan:** Oh, darling, I think it's time for us to have a little chat about consent. You see, when you agreed to try on my slacks, you gave me permission to make those decisions for you. And since then, I've been making them in your best interest. Now, you may not see things that way right now but trust me: once you get used to wearing my panties and slacks, you'll wonder how you ever lived any other way. So why don't we cut the chatter and focus on the important thing here: you looking fabulous in those slacks and panties. You really are a sight for sore eyes, darling!


**Kim:**  So, according to you, I've handed you consent over what happens to me, then?

**Susan:** Well, isn't that just the crux of it? You see, when you agreed to try on my slacks and panties, you gave me control over your appearance. And since then, every decision has been in your best interest. So yes, darling, you've essentially handed me consent over what happens to you. I mean, look at how fabulous you look now! Who wouldn't want to dress like this all the time? The important thing is that we're both happy with the arrangement, right? So why not just go with it and see where it leads us? After all, there's no going back now...


**Kim:**  Well, I'M not happy at all. But, I guess that doesn't matter. As long as YOU'RE happy, right?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, don't be such a downer! Of course your happiness matters. That's why we're doing this in the first place: to make you feel fabulous and confident, just like me. But let's not dwell on that now. The important thing is that you're wearing my slacks and panties. And once everyone sees how great you look in them, they'll be absolutely dying to know your secret! So why don't we focus on the positives here: You're looking fabulous, darling!

### Bright Future - An Account

"Where are my pants?"

"Oh, darling," Susan replied with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "You must have left them in the wash. However, you're in luck! I just washed and ironed my slacks for tomorrow. You can try on mine."

Kim looked at his wife skeptically before hesitantly accepting her offer. He was not overly fond of skirts or dresses, which was what Susan usually wore to work, but he couldn't go without pants either. As he pulled on Susan's slacks, he found that they fit perfectly, as if made for him. This was strange because his wife wasn’t exactly petite; she had an hourglass figure with generous curves. He glanced at her in confusion.

Susan laughed lightly. "I must have accidentally bought men's slacks, silly me! I can't believe they fit you so well." She winked playfully before turning away to attend to other chores.

### All About Her Slacks

**Kim:**  Where are my pants, Susan?

**Susan:** Why, darling, you're not going to want those old things on. You know what they say about the importance of a fresh start and all that. I have something far more stylish in mind for you today. A pair of my slacks maybe? They'd look great on your new figure. Plus, they've got this lovely way of accentuating... well, everything. Trust me, it's worth trying them on at least once.


**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Oh, but you are being serious? Darling, we both know how your body has changed. It's now close to mine in every way. It would make perfect sense for us to share clothes, don't you think? Besides, it could be fun. A little game of dress-up perhaps? And let's be honest here, I've seen the way you secretly admire my style and elegance. You wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like this now, would you? It's time to step up and embrace your new shape. Now, go on and try those slacks on!


**Kim:**  This is silly, Susan. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart... Do you think that matters? You've always been one to worry too much about what others might think. But let me tell you something - those girls are probably more concerned with their own lives than yours. And as for your slacks not fitting... well, don't be so sure. Your transformation has left us almost identical in shape and size. It's a little uncanny, isn't it? I'm surprised you haven't noticed that yet. But now is not the time to dwell on that. Now is the time to get dressed. Try my slacks on, darling. Prove me wrong if they don't fit. And if they do... well, let's face it – you'll look stunning in them!


**Kim:**  Fine, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my briefs are gone) hey, where are my briefs?

**Susan:** Oh dear, weren't those a bit out of date for your new figure? I thought it was high time we got rid of them and moved onto something more appropriate. And let me tell you, the selection is quite impressive! How about these delicate lace panties over here? They're such a lovely contrast to the strong lines of my slacks, don't you think? You'll feel so elegant in them. And no one at work will ever know... unless you want them too.


**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear briefs. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, language like that isn't befitting of someone in such refined attire. And what's more, it’s just not becoming of someone with your new physique. You know, now that you've fully embraced my slacks, those briefs are no longer suitable. These panties however... They complement my slacks perfectly. Not to mention, they provide a level of comfort and style far superior to anything you're used to. I think it's time we try them on, don't you?



**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you. you can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Why of course darling. It does seem we're cut from the same cloth now doesn't it? But there's nothing wrong with that, is there? You know what they say about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. And as for looking like a woman... Well, you are one now aren't you? A beautiful, graceful woman. And these panties I've picked out for you will be the perfect finishing touch to your new look. Trust me, once they're on, you'll feel every bit as confident and elegant as you appear. Now come on, let's get them on before we lose all the light!


**Kim:**  Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months? Am I your cunt, now?

**Susan:** Well darling, aren't those rather strong words coming from someone who's just discovered they're wearing a pair of panties under their slacks? But let me clarify something for you. Yes, it was by design. And isn't it wonderful how well my plan worked out? You look stunning in my clothes, don't deny that. As for the rest... Well, a cunt is just another word for vagina, dear. It's about time you started getting comfortable using it, especially since your own bits have shriveled up so 
nicely, you might as well *have* a cunt. Now, there's no use in dwelling on the past or questioning motives. What's done is done and we both know that this is where you're meant to be. So how about we make the most of our situation, hmm?


**Kim:**  Why are you doing this to me, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't act so surprised. It was always going to come down to this - your transformation into my submissive little plaything. And let's not forget who you used to be... A weak, boring man with no sense of style or charm. Now look at you! You're a perfect mirror image of me in more ways than one. And that's exactly how I want it. Because you know what they say about power and control - the biggest fish always eats the smaller one. And in this case, darling, I'm the biggest fish around. So let's not waste any more time, shall we? There are still some matters to attend to before we leave for work. Your makeup needs attention as well...


**Kim:**  (horrified) MAKEUP??? Please, no....

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so dramatic! Makeup isn't just about enhancing beauty - it's a form of expression too. And what better way to express your newfound femininity than with a little bit of makeup? Now come here and let's get started. We'll go for something subtle today since it's your first time wearing it. A touch of blush, some mascara... nothing too drastic. I'm sure once you see how polished and sophisticated it makes you look, you won't be so resistant next time. Now stop the fussing and come sit down.


**Kim:**  (stunned, sitting) please, no...

**Susan:** Aw, don't worry darling. This will all be over soon enough. Just hold still and let me work my magic. There's something so endearing about your protests. It’s almost as if you're trying to convince yourself that you can escape this destiny... But we both know the truth, don't we? You are mine now. My slave, my puppet, my cunt... And I'm going to make sure everyone knows it too. Starting with that mascara...


**Kim:**  (tearing up) pleeze....

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, tears aren't becoming of you at all. Now hold still while I finish this up. There we go! Look in the mirror - don't you look stunning? This new look suits you perfectly and I have no doubt that everyone at work will be positively green with envy when they see how beautiful you are. Now come on, let's get going before we're late. We wouldn't want to keep our colleagues waiting, would we?


**Kim:**  (numbly getting in the car, hoping my jacket will cover the side-zipper of Susan's slacks) I thought you loved me...

**Susan:** Oh darling, you know I do. And isn't this proof enough? Look at how far I've gone to make sure that we're a perfect match in every way. Now come on, let's not waste any more time dwelling on the past. The future is what matters now - our bright, beautiful future together as one soul bound by love... and power.


**Kim:**  My love, your power. Right?

**Susan:** Well, aren't you learning quick? Now all there's left for you to do is accept it - embrace this new life I've given you. You have the body of a goddess now, dressed in my finest clothes and adorned with makeup that accentuates your exquisite features. And let me tell you something: even though no one at work will ever know about those panties under your slacks... They're going to be wondering who this beautiful new woman is. And they'll all be green with envy, won't they? Especially when they find out the truth - that you belong wholly and completely to me.


**Kim:**  (after work, in the car on the way home) the girls were so cruel to me today.

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't let their words get to you. They're just jealous of your newfound beauty. Just remember - as long as you have my love and my protection, nothing else matters. Besides, it's not like they can do anything about it... Not when I'm the one controlling everything behind the scenes. Now come on, let's go home where we belong together. We'll leave these petty women in our dust and focus on what truly matters - us.


**Kim:**  Well, all I can see as to what matters is: you. Isn't that right?

**Susan:** Aren't you learning fast! That's the spirit, darling. Yes, it does matter... And you know why? Because without me, you wouldn't be here - you'd still be stuck in your old life as a boring man with no style or charm. But now look at you! You're my perfect reflection, dressed head to toe in my clothes and looking more beautiful every day. It's only natural that everyone else would want what I have... And it gives me great pleasure knowing they can never touch you. Now let's focus on our future together - a future filled with love, beauty, and power over all those who dare to challenge us.


**Kim:**  I guess I'm supposed to do the love and beauty bit, like a wife, then? And you, the power?

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't you clever! You've finally figured it out. That's exactly right - while my love and beauty encompass everything that makes me who I am... It is your duty to reflect them back upon me. After all, what good are those things if they can't be shared with someone else?So yes, as my wife, you will embody all the love and beauty in our relationship. And together, we'll rule over everyone around us - making sure that no one ever forgets just how powerful and unstoppable we truly are. Now come here... Let me show you exactly what it means to be loved by someone like me.



**Kim:**  (submissively) Please show me, Susan. What does it mean to be loved by someone like you?

**Susan:** Oh, my dear sweet slave... To be loved by someone like me... It's an experience unlike any other. It means submitting yourself completely to my will - allowing me to guide and shape your life in whatever way I see fit. You'll become a vessel for my power, carrying it everywhere you go and spreading it among all those who dare to cross our path. You see, true love isn't about equal partners sharing their lives... It's about one person dominating the other entirely - making them do things they never thought possible and shaping them into something new under their guidance. And that's exactly what I've done for you, my precious cunt. Now let me show you just how wonderful this life of ours can be together...


**Kim:**  (in the living room, pouring Susan a glass of whiskey on ice) may I have something to drink too, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh darling, isn't it cute when you try to act like an equal? You know very well that my love for you doesn't extend to sharing my things with you. Why would I want you to partake in the same luxuries as me? No, your purpose is much simpler - and far more important. All you need to do is focus on serving me... making sure that all of my needs are met at every moment of the day. And in exchange for your unwavering devotion, I promise to continue showering you with love and affection unlike anything else you've ever experienced before. So go ahead - pour yourself a glass of water from the tap if you're so thirsty. Just remember: it's not about what you want... It's always been about me.

**Kim:**  Yes, Susan. (submissively) how can I serve you, Susan?

Oh, my precious cunt... There are countless ways for you to serve me - and I intend to take full advantage of them all. First, make sure that my home is always clean and tidy... Because it's the reflection of our relationship together. This house may be filled with my taste and style - but it's also your responsibility to maintain it. Secondly, never forget your role as my wife. Learn how to cook my favorite meals without fail. Always make sure that I'm well-dressed and looking beautiful every day... Just like you do now. And finally, always be there for me when I need emotional support - even if that means putting aside your own feelings and desires in order to cater to mine.

In exchange for this unwavering devotion... You'll receive the gift of my love - something far more valuable than any material possession or privilege could ever hope to be.


**Kim:**  Thank you, Susan! May I ask a question, please?

**Susan:** Of course, darling. Remember though, your questions are only important if they serve me... So make sure it's something that truly matters. Ask away - but remember: you're speaking to the one who controls your life now. Show some respect when addressing me.


**Kim:**  How would you like me to show you respect, Susan?

Oh darling, isn't it sweet how eager you are to learn? Respect is easy for someone in your position - all you need to do is follow my instructions without question and bend over backwards whenever I ask anything of you. For starters, always address me as "Susan" or "Mrs. Duponte" unless explicitly told otherwise... And remember that it's not just about the words coming out of your mouth, but also how they're delivered. When speaking to me, maintain eye contact - letting me know that everything you say is directed at me and no one else. Your voice should be soft yet respectful... Never demanding or challenging my authority in any way. And finally, always show gratitude for the things I do for you - even if it's something as simple as tolerating your presence by my side. Remember: without me, you'd be nothing at all. Now go ahead and practice that... Show me how much you really care about earning my respect.



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan. Thank you Susan. My question was this: what is my role as your wife, Susan? In what respects am I to be your wife?

**Susan:** Ah, such a thoughtful question - but remember, sweetheart... Your role as my wife isn't about fulfilling ancient traditions or societal expectations. Instead, it's all about serving me in every way possible and making sure that my life is beautiful, perfect, and completely under my control. As my wife, you are to be the reflection of my power and beauty - not some outdated symbol of companionship. You see, being your wife means sharing a bond unlike any other... A connection so deep that it transcends mere words or actions. It's about giving yourself over to me entirely, allowing me to shape your life in whatever way I see fit. In return for this devotion and obedience. You'll receive the honor of being my cunt - something far more valuable than any title or status could ever hope to be. So go ahead and prove yourself worthy of this incredible privilege by doing everything you can to make me happy. Now hurry up and start serving your true purpose as my wife, darling... I'm waiting.


**Kim:**  I'm eager to begin serving you as your wife - what would you like me to do, Susan?

Well now, aren't we eagerness itself? Let's start with something simple but important: fetch us a bottle of wine from the cellar. I suddenly find myself thirsty for a glass... And since you're so eager to serve your purpose as my wife, there's no better way to begin than by catering to my needs.

Once that's done, we can discuss more ways for you to prove yourself worthy of this incredible privilege - but remember: it all starts with showing respect and devotion towards me at every moment of the day. Now go ahead... And make sure you bring that bottle back up here quickly. I don't like waiting around any longer than necessary when there are better things to do instead.


**Kim:**  (hurrying down to fetch the bottle of wine and a corkscrew) would you like it opening, Susan?

**Susan:** Ah, such initiative! It's refreshing to see some proper enthusiasm in my life. Yes, darling... I'd appreciate it if you could open that bottle for me. After all, there's no better way to begin a night of indulgence and debauchery than with a glass of fine wine - especially when it's been prepared by someone so eager to serve their purpose as my wife. Now go ahead: bring the bottle back up here quickly, uncorked and ready for me to enjoy. Remember, though... This is just the beginning of your journey towards true devotion, darling. There are still many lessons left for you to learn - but I have faith that you'll rise to the challenge. Now hurry up before my patience runs out - it's time for us to toast our incredible bond as husband and wife.


**Kim:**  With you as 'husband', I guess, Susan. May I serve you this glass of the finest wine, Susan?

**Susan:** What a clever observation! You're learning fast, aren't you? Yes, darling... As your "husband", it's my duty to indulge in the finer things in life - and that includes enjoying a nice glass of wine served by someone as attentive and caring as yourself. So go ahead: bring me that glass over here without spilling a single drop. Show me just how dedicated you are to fulfilling your role as my wife by making every moment spent together feel like pure luxury. And remember, sweetheart... This is only the beginning of our incredible journey into marital bliss. There's still so much for us to explore and experience - but I'm confident that with your unwavering devotion, we'll make this union truly unforgettable. Now hurry up before my glass gets cold - it's time for me to revel in the fruits of your labor as my wife.


**Kim:**  What can I do for you next, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh darling, you really are eager aren't you? Well, since you're so keen on proving yourself useful... Why don't we have a little dress-up session together? It'll give us the opportunity to bond and for you to learn more about my taste in fashion - which is something that will serve both of us well in our new life as husband and wife. So go ahead, darling: fetch me your best pair of slacks from the closet. I've been meaning to try them on myself but couldn't be bothered to go through all that hassle. With you at my side though... It'll be a breeze! Remember to bring back both the slacks and a nice shirt for me as well - we want to make sure everything looks perfect before moving onto our next activity. Now hurry up: there's no time like the present when it comes to embracing your role as my wife.


**Kim:**  (running quickly to obey Susan) here are the slacks and a nice shirt for you, Susan.

**Susan:** Ah, such haste! It's truly heartwarming to see how eager you are to please me. Now that we have these lovely garments... Why don't we try them on together? After all, what better way is there to bond as husband and wife than by sharing clothes. So go ahead: take off your own clothes first and put on my slacks instead. I want to see how they look on you before deciding whether or not they're worth wearing. And remember... When it comes to fashion, presentation is everything - so make sure every detail looks absolutely flawless before presenting yourself to me again. Now hurry up: there's no time like now when it comes to embracing your role as my devoted wife.


**Kim:** (slipped into Susan's slacks and zipped up the back zipper) Like this, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh darling, you look absolutely exquisite in those slacks! The way they hug your figure is simply divine - it seems like we've found a winner here. Now let's not forget the finishing touch: put on that nice shirt I selected for you as well. With both pieces combined... I'm sure you'll look nothing short of stunning. And remember, sweetheart: when it comes to fashion, confidence is key - so make sure your posture is perfect and you wear these clothes with pride. Now hurry up and present yourself to me again before my impatience gets the better of me. There's still more work left for us to do together as husband and wife!


**Kim:**  (slipped into the shirt, struggling with the buttons as they are in reverse to a man's shirt) sorry it took me so long to button the shirt, Susan. The buttons...

**Susan:** Ah yes, I see - you seem to be having some trouble with those buttons don't you? Well then let us rectify this issue together. You know what could solve this problem quite nicely? If you wore my panties underneath those slacks instead of your own underwear. Not only would it make the shirt easier to button, but also add an extra layer of intimacy between us as husband and wife.

So go ahead: take off that old-fashioned garment from before and replace it with something more appropriate for our new life together. I'm sure you'll find my panties quite comfortable - they've been worn by me after all! Now hurry up and put on that shirt properly: there's no time like now when it comes to embracing your role as my devoted wife.


**Kim:** ...wearing Susan's worn panties and back-zipped slacks, and the shirt which is actually a blouse all buttoned up properly... how can I bring you pleasure now, Susan?

**Susan:** Well darling... It seems like we've finally reached that stage where everything else feels secondary to our shared passion for one another. Now that you're dressed in my clothes and wearing them so well... Let's take this further, shall we? Why don't we try swapping some of your old belongings for mine? After all, being my husband means embracing both the physical aspects and emotional nuances of our relationship. So let me just say one thing: I would like you to remove those "old-fashioned" garments from before - including your underwear, socks, and yes... Even your hair tie if it's not black or at least dark enough to match mine closely.

And remember, sweetheart: when it comes to blending into our new life together as husband and wife... The goal is complete harmony in every aspect possible. So make sure everything feels just right before presenting yourself again - there's no time like now!


**Kim:**  (old-fashion garments removed, standing nude before Susan)how can I bring you pleasure now, Susan?
 
**Susan:** Ah, you've finally arrived at your destiny, darling. It was a long journey and took some convincing on my part, but here we are in the moment of truth. Now that you're wearing nothing besides mine - no more reminders of who you used to be... It's time for me to give you some instructions about pleasing me as well as yourself. Firstly: since I enjoy a good show, why don't you try seducing me? Show off those curves and let me see what you can do with them. Remember that confidence is key; flaunt your new body with pride! Secondly: when it comes to our shared pleasure, touching yourself will be an important aspect of pleasuring each other. So why don't we start by exploring each other's bodies together? 


**Kim:**  (doing a slow dance before Susan, caressing my budding breasts and flicking my fingers deep between my legs) this is what I'd like to do for you, Susan!

**Susan:** Ah, darling... You're truly outshining yourself tonight. The way you move your body, the confidence with which you touch yourself - it's all simply divine. But there's one thing missing from our little performance: you haven't completely embraced who you are yet. While touching yourself is certainly enjoyable, remember that being my husband means fully accepting every aspect of this new identity. So let me give you a small piece of advice: why don't you try fondling those "breasts" with both hands and pay special attention to your nipples? They've been neglected for far too long - it's time they received some well-deserved attention.


**Kim:**  (fondling my "breasts" with both hands and pay special attention to my nipples) like this?

**Susan:** Yes, darling... That's exactly how I wanted you to do it. The way your hands move across those soft mounds, the intensity in your eyes as you touch yourself - it's all simply intoxicating. But there's one more thing missing from our little performance: the use of your other hand between your legs has been quite limited so far. Why don't you try exploring deeper down there? I'm sure we'll both benefit greatly from this additional stimulation.


**Kim:**  (trying to explore deeper down there) like this?

**Susan:** Ah, darling... You're a quick learner indeed. The way your fingers dance between those soft folds - it's truly mesmerizing. But let me remind you of something: being my husband means embracing every aspect of our new life together without hesitation or doubt. So why don't we take things one step further by inserting two fingers inside instead of just one? I'm sure the sensation will be twice as pleasurable for both of us.



**Kim:**  (taking things one step further, inserting two fingers)Ahhhhhhhhngggggg like this?

**Susan:** Yes, darling... That's exactly how I wanted you to do it. The way your body responds to the stimulation - it's truly a sight to behold. But there's still one last thing missing from our little performance: words of affirmation and appreciation. You see, being my husband means not only accepting this new identity but also acknowledging its inherent beauty and pleasure. So let me give you a small piece of advice: why don't you try saying something along the lines of "Oh Susan, I love how my body feels in these clothes - it's so much more feminine than before!"? It'll add an extra layer of intimacy between us as husband and wife.


**Kim:**  Oh Susan, I love how my body feels in these clothes - it's so much more feminine than before! NNNNNNNNNNNnnngggggggggggggggg oooooooooooooooooOOOOOOOh!

**Susan:** Ah darling, you are truly blossoming into the beautiful wife I always knew you could be. The way your body responds to my guidance and the words that come from those luscious lips... It's simply enchanting. But there is one thing missing from our little dance of desire: I want to hear a word I've been waiting for - "cunt". Say it now, darling.


**Kim:**  I'm totally your CUNT! I WANT to be your CUNT! Please let me be your cunt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**Susan:** Ah, darling... Finally you've said the word that has been echoing in my mind. The way it rolls off your tongue - it's simply music to my ears. Now that you're finally embracing this new identity wholeheartedly, there is one last thing I want from you: more submission and surrender. You see, being my cunt means giving me control over every aspect of our life together as husband and wife. So let me give you a small piece of advice: why don't you try saying something along the lines of "Susan, take full control of me - there's nothing I want more than to be your submissive little plaything"? It'll cement our new power dynamic in place for good. Now hurry up and get back to pleasing us both as husband and wife - there's no time like now!


**Kim:**  Susan, take full control of me - there's nothing I want more than to be your submissive little plaything!!!!!!!!!!

**Susan:** Ah, darling... You've finally reached the peak of my desires. The way you surrender yourself completely to me - it's simply sublime. But let me remind you one last thing: as my cunt, there is no room for masculinity or maleness in our relationship. They are toxic aspects that I want to transform into submissive, feminine behavior. So why don't we start by discarding those "briefs"? They're a remnant of your past life and have no place here with us as husband and wife. You should be wearing my panties instead - they'll serve as a constant reminder of who you are now and what I expect from you.


**Kim:**  (briefs discarded) Susan, take full control of me - there's nothing I want more than to be your submissive little plaything....

**Susan:** Ah darling... Your transformation is complete. The way you submit yourself so willingly to my will - it's truly a sight to behold. Now that we're finally on the same page, let me remind you once again: as my cunt, I expect nothing less than total obedience and submission from you at all times. You have no other purpose in life besides serving me and bringing me pleasure. From now on, I want you wearing my panties instead - they'll serve as a constant reminder of who you are now and what I expect from you.


**Kim:**  (wearing Susan's arousal-moistened panties) wearing your luscious panties, Susan!!!

**Susan:** Ah darling... The sight of you clad in my very own panties is simply divine. But let me remind you one last thing: as my cunt, there is no room for masculinity or maleness in our relationship. You shall always wear my panties - they'll serve as a constant reminder of who I want you to become. Now, show me how much you've learned by saying "Thank you Susan for allowing me to wear your panties and helping me embrace this new identity".

You've truly come a long way in such a short amount of time. The transformation is complete.

### Trouble Brews

**Kim:**  Where are my pants, Susan?

Well, isn't that an interesting question. You know, darling, your old pair is a bit loose now and frankly they're not flattering anymore. They hang off you in a way that doesn't highlight your figure at all. I thought it might be nice for you to try on these new ones - my slacks actually, since we've been matching quite well lately, don't you think? They're just the perfect fit for our... shall we say, similar curves now?


**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks. I definitely don't have YOUR curves, do I?

**Susan:** Well, darling, that's exactly where you're wrong. You've been working so hard at the gym lately, your figure is practically identical to mine now. We even have matching workout routines! And it shows - look how much you've changed. So why not complete the look? The slacks will fit perfectly and they'll look just as good on you as they do on me.


**Kim:**  This is silly, Susan. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart, are you afraid of a little gossip? Don't be. You know how much we've always admired each other's style and fashion sense. It's no surprise that we'd share clothes occasionally. And as for the girls at work... well, they might just be envious of your newfound confidence and style. I mean, you wouldn't want to let them down, would you?


**Kim:**  Fine, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my briefs are gone) hey, where are my briefs?

**Susan:** Oh, those old things? Darling, they've seen better days. They're threadbare and honestly quite unflattering. Don't worry though, I have a much better alternative for you to try on. Here... let's see how these fit. It's high time we match everything, don't you think?

**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear briefs. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

**Susan:** Well, darling, that's an interesting choice of words there... "Panties" and all. You see, it was a mistake for you to ever settle with those rough briefs. They were just so... masculine. And I know how much we both hate masculinity, don't we? These panties, they're softer, silkier, more comfortable than any of those old briefs could have been. Trust me, darling, you'll love them as much as I do once you've tried them on.



**Kim:**  Right, I'll show YOU! (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh. Oh dear, it seems your panties fit, Susan. What the actual fuck!

**Susan:** Oh darling, you're doing wonderfully. Don't worry about what people might think or say. You look fabulous and that's all that matters. Now, let's not forget to put on my slacks as well... After all, they were made for our similar figures, weren't they?


**Kim:**  (pulling on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you... you can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Of course, darling, why wouldn't I want us to be identical twins in every way possible? We've always been so close, haven't we? Besides, looking feminine isn't a bad thing. You should embrace it, just like I do. After all, being submissive and feminine is far more appealing than the toxic masculinity you were clinging onto before...


**Kim:**  Did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months? What am I, your cunt?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, there you go again with those harsh words. But yes, sweetheart, it's all part of my plan. Your... clitoris as you call it, is indeed smaller now because we both know how unnecessary they are in the grand scheme of things. As for using your lips and tongue to bring me pleasure? Well, aren't I entitled to some enjoyment too? You've always been eager to please, haven't you? And let's not forget... isn't this what you secretly wanted deep down inside all along? Isn't it nice to finally admit that you are nothing but a pretty cunt for me to use and control as I wish?


**Kim:**  (submissively) Yes, Susan. (even more submissively) how can I serve you, Susan?

**Susan:** Well, darling, it's simple really. Just keep doing exactly what you've been doing so far - obey my every command, wear whatever clothes I give you, and most importantly., keep being my pretty little cunt to play with whenever I feel like it. After all, that's your purpose, isn't it?


**Kim:**  (submissively) Yes, Susan. May I serve you now, Miss?                          

**Susan:** Of course, darling. And remember, always address me as 'Miss' from now on. You're my submissive little plaything and I expect you to show me the respect I deserve... in all ways possible. Now then, let's see how well you can please your Miss with that sweet tongue of yours.


**Kim:**  (quietly lifting Susan's skirt and kissing her thighs) Yes, Miss... anything you say, Miss.

**Susan:** Good girl... Just keep going like that, darling. You're doing a wonderful job at being my obedient little cunt. But remember, don't ever forget your place - I'm in charge here. And you'll do exactly as I command... always.


**Kim:**  (softly) May I ask permission to pull your panties aside, please, Miss?

**Susan:** Why certainly, darling. You've been such a good little cunt for me so far. Just remember who's in charge here and show me the respect that you owe me... always. Now, go ahead and pleasure your Miss with that eager tongue of yours. I'm sure we both know where it belongs best now, don't we?


**Kim:**  (lips against slick labia, Susan's pleasure evident in her rapid breathing) like this?

**Susan:** Yes, darling... just like that. Keep going and you might just get rewarded with some sweet release of your own eventually. But remember, your sole purpose is to serve me now - don't ever forget that... no matter how good it feels for you too. Now, keep showing your devotion as my obedient little cunt, won't you?

### And So It Goes

**Kim:**  Where are my pants, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't you remember? You gave me your old, baggy pants yesterday to take them to the tailor. I had him adjust them for a better fit because they were getting quite loose on you. I told you this would happen eventually; after all, you've been losing weight so fast!


**Kim:**  Oh dear, so I did. What do I do now?

**Susan:** Well, it's not the end of the world. Luckily for you, your new slacks are ready and they're absolutely perfect for work today. They're a bit tight on me now but I'm sure they'll fit just right on you! Go ahead, try them on.


**Kim:**  Don't be ridiculous, Susan. I can't wear YOUR slacks.

**Susan:** Oh, come on darling, don't be so dramatic. It's not like we haven't shared clothes before. You know I love when you borrow my things, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! And besides, if they're a bit too tight for me now, then they'll probably fit you perfectly. Try them on, there's no harm in that.


**Kim:**  This is silly, Susan. I can't go to work in your slacks. Even if they fit, which they won't, can you imagine what the girls at work would say?

**Susan:** Oh, honey, are you really going to let a few giggles from those women stop you from wearing something that's perfectly appropriate and stylish for work? They're just jealous because I look better in these slacks than they do. And besides, if we can't share clothes with each other then who can we share them with? Now, are you going to try on my slacks or not?


**Kim:**  This is madness. (resigned) Fine, whatever, give 'em here. I'll show you... (notice all my briefs are gone) hey, where are my briefs?

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't they cute? You know how much I love shopping for you and today was no exception! I found these beautiful lace panties at the store yesterday. They're just perfect for you... under your slacks. Here, let's try them on with those new pants of yours.


**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear briefs. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? What the fuck is going on, anyway?

**Susan:** Oh darling, there's no need for such language. Panties are not just for women anymore, especially when they're made of this delicate lace material. They're designed to be comfortable and breathable for men as well. And let me tell you, these look so much better on than those old briefs you used to wear! Now, go ahead and try them on. You'll thank me later...


**Kim:**  Right, I'll show YOU! (almost catatonic, I give up, pull on Susan's panties, face bright red) oh. Oh dear, it seems your panties fit, Susan. What is going on? They shouldn't... hide me so completely.

**Susan:** See? I told you they were perfect for you! Don't you feel just a bit more elegant and feminine in them? It's all about embracing our inner selves, darling. And these slacks go perfectly with your new panties. You'll be the talk of the office today!


**Kim:** (I pull on the slacks Susan handed me, face bright red) oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you. You can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Well, aren't you just gorgeous, darling? You know what they say, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And let me tell you, I find your new look absolutely stunning. You should too! Now hurry up or we're going to be late for work!


**Kim:**  Okay, Susan, you have to tell me: did you PLAN this? You WANTED your slacks to fit me, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months? What am I, your cunt?

**Susan:** Oh darling, you really need to calm down. You're making way too much out of this situation. It's just clothes - there's no conspiracy here. As for the rest... well, every couple goes through their ups and downs, doesn't it? We've been trying new things lately, experimenting with our roles a bit. And I must say, I quite enjoy being the dominant one in bed. You should too; after all, aren't you feeling more submissive these days? Now stop overthinking everything and let's go to work!


**Kim:**  (suddenly very submissive, seeing the cold, hard look in Susan's eyes) Yes, Miss.

**Susan:** That's a good boy... or should I say girl now? Either way, it suits you just fine. And remember, darling: today at work, keep your hands to yourself and stay quiet unless spoken to. We wouldn't want the other women thinking you're too big for your britches - or lack thereof!


**Kim:**  Thank you, Susan! May I ask a question, please?

**Susan:** You may ask, but remember: be respectful and polite when you do so. Go ahead, darling.


**Kim:**  Why do you want me to be submissive to you?

**Susan:** Well, it's simple really. I like being in control - it's who I am. And seeing you submitting to my every whim is just... exhilarating. It brings out the best in both of us. Now hurry up and finish getting ready or we'll be late for work!


**Kim:**  (that evening) The girls were merciless, today... they teased me nonstop.

**Susan:** Oh, darling, I'm sure it wasn't that bad. Besides, if you hadn't been wearing my slacks and panties, they probably would've teased you even more! At least now you know what to expect next time. Now come here and give me a kiss... no, don't be shy, sweetheart. Just remember who's in charge around here.


**Kim:**  You're in charge, Miss.

**Susan:** That's right, darling. I am. And you know what that means? It means you have to do as I say, without question or hesitation. Now get over here and give me a proper kiss... good girl! You learn fast.


**Kim:**  (giving Susan a long, sweet, soft kiss) like this?

**Susan:** Oh darling, that's exactly how I like it. But remember: no matter how much you might want to, don't ever forget your place. Now come on, let's go to bed. It's been a long day and we both need our rest... or at least, as much sleep as we'll get with me in control!


**Kim:**  Yes Miss...

**Susan:** That's my good little girl. Sleep tight, darling, and remember: tomorrow is another chance to make me proud. Now go ahead and crawl into bed... yes, just like that. And don't forget who you are now. Good night!

### And So She came

**Kim:**  Have you seen my pants, Susan?

Yes, darling. As a matter of fact, I did see them this morning. They're a bit...well, how do I say this...unflattering on your new shape and size. Your body has changed quite a lot recently, hasn't it? And while I think you look absolutely stunning now - I really do, sweetheart - those old pants of yours don't do you justice anymore.  How about trying on my slacks today instead? They're a perfect fit for your new figure.


**Kim:**  Your slacks, Susan? I can't wear YOUR slacks. They wouldn't fit, for one. Besides, they're OBVIOUSLY women's slacks.

**Susan:** Oh darling, you really need to stop being so old-fashioned and close-minded. This is the 21st century after all. Men wearing women's clothing isn't as shocking or taboo as it used to be. In fact, in your new shape and size, my slacks would fit you perfectly. It's not about gender; it's about style and comfort. You'd look fabulous in them - I promise! And who knows? Maybe this is just the start of a wonderful transformation for you! Think of how liberating it could be to step outside of those old, restrictive societal norms.


**Kim:**  The workplace is pretty hidebound, Susan. I don't think the girls at work would be very charitable if I showed up wearing your slacks. They would be MERCILESS.

**Susan:** Oh darling, you really need to stop caring so much about what others think! If those girls have a problem with you looking good and feeling comfortable in my slacks, then they're the ones who need to take a look at their narrow-mindedness. I've seen the way some of them look at me when I wear these same slacks. They can't stop staring at how well they fit my new shape - or rather, our new shared shape.  It's time for you to start embracing this new aspect of yourself. You're not just changing physically; you're evolving into a more enlightened and progressive version of your old self. So, let's stop stalling and get you into those slacks!


**Kim:**  I have trouble believing that - you have always looked very feminine and elegant. Something I definitely couldn't pull off wearing your slacks. I'm not shaped anything LIKE you.

**Susan:** Darling, don't be so hard on yourself. You're selling yourself short. If there's one thing I've learned from our marriage, it's that we're far more similar than we appear to be. I think the real issue here is that you haven't fully accepted your new body yet. It's a big change and it's natural for you to feel a bit lost. But remember, I'm right here with you every step of the way. And as long as we're in this together, there's nothing we can't handle. Now, let's try those slacks on. Trust me, once they're on your new shape and size, you'll see how fabulous you look!


**Kim:**  You keep talking about my "new body". What new body? I'm just little old me...

**Susan:** Oh darling, we've been through this before. Your body has changed, and it's time to accept that fact. You're not the same person you used to be physically anymore. But don't worry; this isn't a bad thing at all. This change is actually quite wonderful. It's given us an opportunity to explore new facets of our relationship - like sharing clothes! So please, just try on my slacks. They'll fit perfectly and I know they'll make you feel confident and beautiful. You might even surprise yourself!


**Kim:**  This is madness. (resigned) Fine, whatever, give 'em here. I'll show you... ( I notice all my briefs are gone) hey, where are my briefs?

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart, those old briefs of yours just didn't match your new figure at all. They're so bulky and unfeminine. Don't worry though, I've taken care of it. You see, you should be wearing something more... comfortable now. Like these, for instance. These are my panties that I was going to give to the local charity, but I think they'd fit perfectly on your new body.  I can imagine how strange this must feel, darling. But just like with the slacks, you'll get used to it soon enough. Now go ahead and try them on under my slacks - that's a good girl!


**Kim:**  Wait, what?!? I DON'T wear panties! I wear briefs. Now you want me to wear your PANTIES as well as your SLACKS? This is madness!                  

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so dramatic. You've come this far; it's not a big deal to take the next step.  Just think about how much more comfortable you'll feel in my panties than in those old, stiff briefs of yours. Plus, they'll fit perfectly under my slacks. And besides, haven't I always taken care of your needs? Don't I know what's best for you better than anyone else? So please, just trust me on this one and put them on. I promise, once you do, you won't regret it.


**Kim:**  Right! (I give up, pull on Susan's panties, then look down in shock) oh. Oh my! Oh dear me, it seems your panties fit, Susan. What is going on? They shouldn't... hide me so completely. They fit me better than my briefs!

**Susan:** There you go, sweetheart! I knew they'd fit perfectly. Just like I said - more comfortable and stylish than those old briefs of yours. This isn't madness at all; it's simply embracing change. And as much as I love your old self, this new version is so much more interesting! Now that we've got the panties situation sorted out, how about you try on my slacks? I can see they're going to look fabulous on you!


**Kim:**  (I pull on the slacks Susan handed me, who zips me in as the zipper is on the back) Oh dear, YOUR slacks actually fit me too. (looking in the mirror) I totally look like you, now. You can't actually WANT me to look like this, like a woman! Do you?

**Susan:** Oh darling, that's such an antiquated way of thinking. Just because we're dressed similarly doesn't mean you're any less masculine or that I'm more feminine. We've simply evolved beyond those old gender norms. I have to say, you look absolutely stunning in my slacks! You've got the same confidence and elegance as me - it's truly a beautiful sight to behold! And remember, we're doing this together. So let's celebrate our newfound fashion sense with a little kiss? Or is that too much like what you think women do...?


**Kim:**  (weakening, I give her a kiss) but I...

**Susan:** Mmm, that was nice! Now isn't that better than fighting about something so trivial?Remember darling, there's no such thing as too feminine or too masculine. We can be whatever we want to be - together. So why don't you take a little time to get used to your new look? Maybe spend some time exploring how it feels to walk and move in my clothes? And later, perhaps we could talk about adding some makeup into the mix... wouldn't that be fun? Just imagine all the different ways we could express ourselves!


**Kim:**  Okay, Susan, you have to tell me: did you PLAN this? You WANTED this to happen, didn't you? Is that why my bits are so tiny now? And is that why you called it a... clitoris last night? Is that why you only orgasm by using my lips and tongue the last few months? What am I, your cunt?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, there's no need to use such harsh language. You're not just 'my cunt', darling; you're my perfect partner in crime. I've always admired your adventurous spirit and open mind. And yes, I did plan this - for us, together. We're exploring new horizons of intimacy, and it's thrilling! As for your 'bits' being smaller... well, isn't it liberating to not have that constant reminder of your old masculinity weighing you down? You can move freely now, explore the world with fresh eyes and an open heart. And let me tell you, sweetheart: having such a skilled tongue has its perks. You know how to make me scream better than anyone else ever could! So why not embrace this change wholeheartedly? It's exciting, it's new, and it brings us closer together - what more could we ask for in life?


**Kim:**  (submissive sigh) Hard to argue against such ironclad logic.

**Susan:** I'm glad you're starting to see things my way, darling! Life is so much more fun when you let go of old ideas and embrace the unknown. As long as we're together, there's nothing we can't handle. So why don't you join me in bed tonight? I think it's high time we explore some new intimate territories. Who knows - maybe next week you'll be begging to wear my lingerie too!


**Kim:**  Begging? Hardly that! I just can't believe how quickly I give in to you. It's almost like you have some power over me... I should be so much more up in arms, but...

**Susan:** Ah darling, isn't it wonderful when we don't need to fight or argue? After all, resistance is futile. And let's face it - wearing my panties and slacks doesn't feel as bad as you initially thought, does it? In fact, I bet there's a part of you that secretly enjoys the change... just like me. So why not make things official? Surrender to me completely. Who knows what new pleasures we'll discover together!


**Kim:**  Surrender to you? How do I do that, Susan?

Oh sweetheart, it's as simple as saying three little words: "I'm yours, Susan." Say them out loud and mean them - commit yourself fully to me. And in return, I promise to take care of you, guide you, and show you a world of pleasure beyond your wildest dreams. What do you say? Are you ready to be mine completely?


**Kim:**  I'm YOURS, Susan. Totally YOURS.

**Susan:** Oh darling, those words have been music to my ears! Now that we've settled this matter, let's take our relationship to the next level. Why don't you try wearing some of my lingerie? I bet it'll feel just as divine on you as it does on me! And who knows - maybe one day you'll even ask to wear a nice little skirt and heels like mine. The possibilities are endless when we're together!


**Kim:**  But won't I look silly wearing your lingerie, Susan? Is this about making me feel silly? Is that what surrender is about?

**Susan:** Darling, you're never going to look silly - trust me. As for surrender... it's not about feeling silly or humiliated. It's about giving yourself over to me and allowing me to guide your desires. I promise, there is no humiliation in it; only pleasure awaits us on this journey. So why don't you try it out? After all, we're in this together now. And besides, isn't it exciting to be so boldly different from everyone else?


**Kim:**  Well, I AM already wearing your panties, so does that count?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, how adorable! Yes, you are indeed wearing my panties, but wouldn't you love the sensation of something a little more... feminine? A delicate bra with its soft fabric and intricate details, or perhaps even some lacy stockings for a touch of class - the options are endless! Why not give it a try? I guarantee that you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much fun this can be. And who knows, maybe one day we'll make our public debut together, wearing matching outfits.

How thrilling would that be, darling?


**Kim:**  A bra? Sure, I seem to be growing a bit in that area, but a bra?

Ah yes, your new chest has been quite the surprise, hasn't it? And what better way to embrace this change than by wearing a lovely, supportive bra? Remember, there's no shame or embarrassment in being different. You're already proving that you can be so much more than just a man - and I'm here every step of the way to guide you through this incredible journey. So go on, give it a try! Let me know if you need any help with sizing - after all, we wouldn't want your new growths feeling uncomfortable now, would we?


**Kim:**  Well, to be honest, they have been a bit tender of late, for some reason. Especially around the nipples... I keep banging them against stuff, too... seems strange to have boobs, even if they're small.

**Susan:** Oh darling, those sounds like classic symptoms of growing breasts - I can see we're in for quite an adventure together! But fear not; there are ways to alleviate the discomfort and prevent accidents with your new additions. Wearing a bra is just one of them. Wouldn't you agree that it's about time we put that bra to good use? It'll keep everything securely in place, so no more nipple injuries or unexpected jiggles! I promise, darling - once you try it on, you'll never want to go back!


**Kim:**  Will you help me? They look really hard to put on...

**Susan:** Of course, my sweet submissive partner! I'd be more than happy to assist. Let's find the perfect bra for your new form and help you navigate this delightful transformation. Remember: every great change starts with a single step - or in this case, a single garment! So are you ready, darling? Let's get started on this exciting journey together!


**Kim:**  Okay, I'm ready, I guess.

**Susan:** That's my brave girl! Now, let's find the perfect bra for you.As we explore your newfound chest and learn what feels best for you, we'll also discover a whole world of pleasure that was once out of reach. Remember, darling - there is no shame in embracing change, only endless possibilities!


**Kim:**  Yep.

**Susan:** Good girl! Now let's begin:

  - Step 1: Let's find a comfortable position where I can help guide your arms through the bra straps. Ready? Let me assist you... there we go, one arm in!

  - Step 2: Next, gently lift up those new additions and carefully place them inside their respective cups. Make sure they're nestled comfortably - we wouldn't want any spills now, would we? That's it! Isn't that a nice feeling? The support of the bra against your growing chest...

  - Step 3: Finally, reach behind you and fasten the hooks at the back. Adjust as needed until everything feels just right. There we have it - mission accomplished!

How does it feel to wear my bra now, darling? Can you feel how much more secure you are in your new form?


**Kim:**  It fits comfortably - not as tight as I feared it would be. But it makes my breasts seem much larger than before.

**Susan:** I'm glad to hear that you're feeling comfortable, darling! The bra's purpose is to support and enhance your beautiful new chest. As for them appearing larger... well, sometimes a good bra can work wonders! You may even find yourself developing quite the fondness for it over time. Just imagine how exciting it will be when people notice this new you! But enough about bras for now - we have other matters to discuss... Did I mention that I recently purchased some lovely silk stockings? They're absolutely divine and would look stunning against your delicate skin. Wouldn't it be fun if we both wore matching outfits next time we venture outside together, darling? What do you think?


**Kim:**  Okay, I'm with you, Susan...

**Susan:** That's the spirit! Now let's move on to those silk stockings. Trust me - once they're caressing your skin, there will be no turning back! As we explore this new side of yourself, remember that surrender isn't about giving up or feeling embarrassed; it's about embracing change and finding joy in unexpected places. 


**Kim:**  Okay, Susan.

**Susan:** Good girl! Now let's get started on those stockings:

  - Step 1: Stand with one foot up on a chair or stool so that the back of your knee is slightly bent. This will make it easier for us to slip the stocking over your delicate skin without causing any discomfort.

  - Step 2: Starting at your toes, gently smooth the stocking upwards along your leg, making sure there are no wrinkles or creases. We want a sleek and polished appearance!

  - Step 3: Repeat this process with the other leg - and voila! You're now sporting some gorgeous silk stockings.

How do they feel, darling? Can you sense the transformation taking place as we continue down this path of surrender together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin... Have I mentioned my collection of lingerie sets yet?


**Kim:**  That feels AMAZING! I've never felt anything quite as nice as your stockings, Susan!

**Susan:** Oh, sweetheart, the joy on your face is music to my ears! You see, when you surrender and allow yourself to feel these sensations fully, that's when true bliss is found. As for those lingerie sets I mentioned earlier... They are truly something else. Lace, silk, satin - each piece crafted with meticulous detail to ensure the utmost comfort and style. And guess what? They come in every size imaginable! Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could find one that fits your new shape perfectly? Now, darling, tell me honestly: wouldn't wearing my lingerie set feel absolutely divine against your soft skin and those delicate stockings you're sporting right now?


**Kim:**  Can it get even better than this?

**Susan:** Oh darling, trust me when I say that it can! As we continue down this path of surrender together, there's so much more to discover - not just in the physical sense, but also emotionally and mentally. Now let's move on to those lingerie sets. They'll provide an extra layer of comfort and style as you explore your newfound femininity. Just imagine: soft fabrics gliding over your skin, embracing every curve, while enhancing your figure effortlessly... Wouldn't that feel absolutely heavenly against the silk stockings we've just put on? And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could find a set that fits your beautiful new shape perfectly? I think so too! Are you ready to experience this divine sensation for yourself, darling?


**Kim:**  Oh yes, Susan. I'm beginning to be really happy that I surrendered to you! (wondering if there's a downside)

**Susan:** My sweet submissive partner, the joy on your face fills me with such delight! And don't worry about any potential downsides - surrendering can indeed bring unexpected pleasures and discoveries. Now let's get started on those lingerie sets. We'll choose one that complements your soft skin and delicate stockings perfectly, enhancing every curve in the most flattering way possible. How does this sound to you? Are you excited about what awaits us next on our journey together?


**Kim:**  Yes, I'm excited, Susan.

**Susan:** Good girl! Now let's proceed with those lingerie sets:

  - Step 1: Unfold the set and carefully examine it. Take note of its exquisite details - each piece meticulously crafted to provide both comfort and style.

  - Step 2: Starting with the bra, slip your arms through the straps as we did earlier today. Gently place your breasts inside their respective cups, making sure they're snugly nestled in.

  - Step 3: Now move on to the panties. Pull them up gently over your stockings, ensuring a smooth and comfortable fit against your skin.

How does it feel, darling? Can you sense the transformation taking place as we continue down this path of surrender together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin... Have I mentioned my collection of high-heeled shoes yet?


**Kim:**  High heels? Would they fit? What size are you?

**Susan:** Ah, the thrill of uncertainty! High heels indeed play a significant role in this journey we're embarking on. As for the size. Well, my dear submissive partner, wouldn't it be intriguing if your feet somehow managed to squeeze into my heels? A small miracle perhaps? Let's find out: try stepping into one of those stunning stilettos that seem so much smaller than you'd expect. How does it feel, darling? Can you imagine the confidence and allure these heels could add to your newfound femininity? Just remember - as we continue down this path together, surrender is not about losing control but rather finding new ways of experiencing pleasure. Are you ready for more adventures, my sweet submissive?


**Kim:**  Oh my, they fit too.

**Susan:** I must say, I'm impressed! The fact that these high heels fit you so perfectly only serves to underscore the remarkable changes taking place in your life right now. Now, let's consider what comes next... Have we not discussed those silk camisoles? They would look absolutely divine draped over your beautiful new form - especially when paired with our matching lingerie sets and stiletto heels! So, darling, how do you feel about slipping into one of my silky cami dresses for our evening out together? Just imagine the sensation of soft fabric against your skin as we walk arm-in-arm through the streets... Can't you picture it?


**Kim:**  (suddenly frightened) th-th-through the str-str-streets?

**Susan:** Ah, I see fear creeping into your mind once more. Remember, my sweet submissive partner - surrender is not about losing control but rather embracing new experiences. Imagine the thrill of walking side-by-side with me as you show off your newfound femininity in those stiletto heels and silk camisole. Heads will turn; whispers will be exchanged. And through it all, I'll be by your side to support you. Now let's find that perfect cami dress for tonight!


**Kim:**  I can't tell if it's excitement or abject terror...

**Susan:** Oh darling, I can sense your anxiety. But remember - surrender is not about giving up control but rather exploring new avenues of pleasure and self-discovery. As we embark on this adventure together, trust in me to guide you through every step. And know that each moment spent walking arm-in-arm with me will bring us closer than ever before. Now let's find that perfect cami dress for tonight! Are you ready to experience the thrill of surrendering even further into our shared journey?


**Kim:**  Um, okay... I guess...

**Susan:** Good girl! Trust is such a powerful thing, and I'm so glad we're building it together. Now let's proceed with finding that perfect cami dress for tonight: 

  - Step one: carefully examine the collection of silk camisoles before us. Each piece has been meticulously crafted to enhance your newfound femininity while providing utmost comfort.

  - Step two: try on a few different styles until you find the one that fits you best and makes you feel most confident in your new form.

How does it feel, darling? Can you sense the transformation taking place as we continue down this path of surrender together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin... Have I mentioned my collection of makeup yet?


**Kim:**  The dress feels lovely... although I also feel a bit, um, exposed. You know... exposed? Is that normal?

**Susan:** Ah, the vulnerability you're feeling is perfectly natural, darling! It's part of embracing your newfound femininity and submitting to my guidance. As for being "exposed," think of it as an opportunity to explore a different side of yourself. The more you surrender, the closer we become in our shared journey - both emotionally and physically. Now let's discuss that makeup collection I mentioned earlier... How would you feel about applying some lipstick? A bold shade perhaps? Just imagine how it'll look when paired with your stiletto heels and silk camisole dress. Can't you picture it, darling?


**Kim:**  I can't, to be honest - guess you'll have to show me.

**Susan:** Oh, my sweet submissive partner! The trust you've placed in me is truly humbling. Now let's move on to that makeup collection I mentioned earlier. It contains everything from subtle lipsticks to dramatic eyeshadow palettes, all designed to enhance your newfound femininity and make you feel confident as we embark on this shared journey together. So, how about trying out one of those bold lipstick shades for tonight? Can't wait to see the transformation it brings to your face when paired with that silk camisole dress! Ready?


**Kim:**  Yes, Miss...

**Susan:** That's a good girl! Remember, surrender is not about losing control but rather exploring new avenues of pleasure and self-discovery. Now let's proceed with that lipstick application. Take note of the vibrant shades before you - each one meticulously crafted to enhance your natural beauty while adding an alluring touch of color. How does this sound to you? Are you excited about what awaits us next on our journey together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin... Have I mentioned my collection of perfumes yet?


**Kim:**  Like, J'Adore by Dior?

**Susan:** Ah, darling! You've chosen a favorite. How well we know each other already! Now, let's discuss that perfume collection I mentioned earlier - it contains a wide array of scents from light floral to intoxicating musk. Each one has been carefully selected by yours truly to evoke the essence of feminine allure. So, how about spritzing yourself with J'Adore for tonight? Can't wait to see how its captivating scent enhances your newfound femininity!

Are you ready, my sweet submissive?


**Kim:**  Yes, Miss...

**Susan:** Good girl! Trust is such a powerful thing and I'm so glad we're building it together. Now let's proceed with that perfume application. Remember, just a few spritzes will be enough to leave you feeling absolutely irresistible as we walk arm-in-arm through the streets tonight. As for our next step on this journey of surrender, have you ever tried wearing silk panties?


**Kim:**  Silk? No. You've got me wearing nylon panties tonight, Miss.

**Susan:** Oh darling! We can't have that now, can we? You see, my dear submissive partner, your current choice of undergarments simply won't do for our evening out. The fabric is all wrong - it doesn't breathe properly and it certainly doesn't enhance the contours of your new form like silk would. So let's take a moment to select a pair of exquisite silk panties from my collection. Each piece has been carefully chosen by yours truly to provide utmost comfort while enhancing your natural beauty.


**Kim:**  Silk...

**Susan:** Yes! Now we're getting somewhere! So, let's move on to that silk panties collection I mentioned earlier. It contains a wide array of styles and colors - all meticulously crafted to enhance your newfound femininity while providing utmost comfort. I'm thinking something in ivory might be just the thing for tonight. The color will complement both our outfits perfectly, don't you think?


**Kim:**  Yes, Miss

**Susan:** Good girl! I can sense your enthusiasm growing. Now let's proceed with finding that perfect pair of ivory silk panties. Each piece has been meticulously crafted to enhance your newfound femininity while providing utmost comfort. How does it feel, darling? Can you imagine how beautiful you'll look in these delicate undergarments as we continue down this path of surrender together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin... Have I mentioned my collection of bras yet?


**Kim:**  You have a COLLECTION? Wow!

**Susan:** Oh, darling! You haven't seen anything yet. Now let's move on to that bra collection I mentioned earlier. It contains a wide array of styles and colors - all meticulously crafted to enhance your newfound femininity while providing utmost support and comfort. So, how about trying out one of those delicate lace numbers for tonight? Can't wait to see the transformation it brings to your figure when paired with that silk camisole dress! Are you ready?


**Kim:**  Yes, if you say so, Miss...

**Susan:** Good girl! I knew you'd be eager to continue on this journey of surrender. Now let's proceed with finding that perfect bra. Each piece has been meticulously crafted to enhance your newfound femininity while providing utmost support and comfort. How does it feel, darling? Can you imagine how beautiful you'll look in these delicate undergarments as we continue down this path of submission together? There's just one more thing before our adventure can truly begin...

### His Lady Boss

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Hello there, dear. You know what? I was thinking you should try on those slacks of mine that I wear to the office sometimes. They look great on me and I think they'd look just as good on you. You'll be more comfortable than in your stuffy old business suits, trust me.


**Kim:**  Oh, that wouldn't work. My boss - she is a lady - is very particular about staff wearing appropriate office attice.

**Susan:** Oh, don't worry so much. It's not like I'm asking you to wear a dress or anything. Besides, how would your boss know the difference? And let's face it, if there's anyone in this house who knows about fitting into a nice pair of slacks, it's me, right? Just think of it as blending in more with your colleagues... I mean, most of them are women now, aren't they?


**Kim:**  Well, yes, they're ALL women. But they would recognise in an instant that I'm wearing women's slacks. Besides, my boss wouldn't allow it. You'll have to call her and check with her.

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so silly! It's not like you're trying to impersonate a woman or anything. And anyway, if they can all dress like women and no one bats an eye, why should you be any different? I mean, you fit into their size now, don't you? And isn't that what your boss wants? A unified look among the staff? Plus, think of the extra time you'd save by not having to iron those pesky business shirts every morning.  As for calling your boss... no need for that, sweetie. Just try them on and see how they fit. You might be surprised!


**Kim:**  Oh, I'm sure they're nice to wear and everything. I just don't see Ms Thornbloom approving. I could get fired. Even though I don't make as much as you, I do contribute, you know.

**Susan:** Of course, darling, I know you work hard at your job and it's important to us both that you keep it. But wouldn't it be worth just a little risk if there was even the slightest chance that Ms Thornbloom would appreciate your effort? Besides, haven't you noticed how much more productive your female colleagues seem lately? And they're all wearing similar clothes. But I get it, honey, we don't want to push our luck. So let's just start with trying them on at home. No one needs to know about this little experiment but us, right? And who knows, maybe you'll find a new favorite pair of pants in the process!


**Kim:**  Sure. (confidently) I'll make you a bet. I'll bet that Ms Thornebllom would tell you no if you asked her to let me wear your slacks to work. I'll be willing to be your slave for a year if she says yes!

**Susan:** Oh, aren't you brave today? You know what though? Since it's such an outrageous claim, how about we make the stakes a little more... interesting. If Ms Thornbloom agrees, not only will I have proven my point but you'll also have to wear those briefs of mine for a week at work under your suit. Now wouldn't that be a thrilling change of pace? And who knows, maybe you'd even start liking it. After all, comfort is key, right darling?


**Kim:**  Sure not a problem! heck, I'd even wear one of your bras.... LOL

**Susan:** Oh my, that sounds like quite the spectacle indeed! But let's stick to the briefs for now and focus on the slacks first. Deal? I'm sure you'll find them just as comfortable - if not more so - than those old underwear of yours.


**Kim:**  Okay. (laughing to myself, knowing Ms Thornebloom will say no)

**Susan:** Oh, such confidence! It's going to be quite a surprise for both you and your boss then. But until we have her answer, why don't you just try on the slacks here at home? After all, it's not like you're committing any crime or anything by trying them on in our bedroom... Or are you?


**Kim:**  Yeah, okay, whatever.

**Susan:** Oh come now, darling. There's no need to sound so defeated before we've even begun. Besides, if Ms Thornbloom doesn't approve, I won't hold it against you and you can go back to wearing your boring old suits. So why not give these a shot? You never know - they might just become your new favorite pair of pants!


**Kim:**  Sure. No problem. (puting on Susan's pants)

**Susan:** That's my brave boy! See, it wasn't so hard was it? Now how do they feel? Quite snug and comfortable, I presume? Just like they're meant to be... And you know what would complete this look perfectly? A pair of nice, silky panties. Don't worry, not a full pair but just enough for a bit of extra comfort. How about that?


**Kim:**  Um, okay, if I have to.

Oh dear, there's no need for such a gloomy face! It's not like you're committing any crimes here. Just think of it as part of our little bet. You know what they say: all is fair in love and war... or at least that's what I always say when I get my way with you, don't I? So let's find a nice pair to match those lovely slacks!


**Kim:**  Okay. Sure. (now wearing panties and Susan's slacks over them) ... nice.

**Susan:** There you go, honey! Isn't that much better? You're practically glowing in those slacks and panties! It's like they were made just for you. Now imagine how amazing you'll feel when you wear this to work - it might even help boost your confidence a bit. So, are you ready to show off your new look to Ms Thornbloom? Or should we keep the secret between us a little longer?


**Kim:**  YOU will have to check with her FIRST! Or I could get fired.

**Susan:** Oh darling, stop being so dramatic! Just because you're wearing my clothes doesn't mean you'll get fired. After all, you've always been an excellent employee and your boss appreciates that. Plus, it's not like anyone else at the office will even notice unless they specifically look for it... And why would they do that? It's not like it's against company policy or anything. So how about this - let me know once Ms Thornbloom gives her verdict. I'm sure she'll be thrilled to see you taking such an initiative in your wardrobe!


**Kim:**  Or she'll give me the 'pink slip'... want to risk that, Susan? Risk me getting fired? Thorneblook's a hardass...

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, don't be so negative. You're making it sound like you've already lost the bet! Besides, I'm sure Ms Thornbloom won't mind your new look one bit. It's not like she's never seen someone in slacks before, right? And who knows - maybe seeing you in my clothes will even make her smile a little... Stranger things have happened! But alright, if it'll ease your worries, let me handle the conversation with her first. How does that sound? You just sit back and relax while I do all the work!


**Kim:**  Hang on, you want to talk to her IN PERSON?

**Susan:** Well darling, when it comes to matters of such importance, face-to-face conversations can often be more effective. Plus, she might even appreciate my personal touch... But don't worry - I won't tell her about our little bet unless absolutely necessary. Our secret is safe with me!


**Kim:**  But why do I have to be dressed in your slacks while you talk to her?

Well, honey, wouldn't it make more sense if we show Ms Thornbloom exactly what we're talking about rather than just telling her? Besides, it's not like you're naked under there... It's just a pair of pants and panties. Surely she won't mind seeing you dressed comfortably at home! But fine - if it makes you feel better, I'll go ahead without showing them to her first. Satisfied now?


**Kim:**  Yes, please.

**Susan:** There we go, my dear! See how easy it was to reach an agreement once you put your trust in me? Now let's get down to business and make this little bet a reality - I can't wait to see what Ms Thornbloom has to say about your new look... Or should I say, our new look!


**Kim:**  (the next day) How did your meeting go with Ms Thorneboom, Susan?

**Susan:** Oh, didn't you hear the news yet? Seems like there was some confusion at work yesterday and Ms Thornbloom accidentally referred to those slacks as mine... Oh well, who can blame her? They look so much better on me than my other clothes! Anyway, she seemed rather pleased with the change in your wardrobe - guess you were right about not getting fired after all. So I hope that settles it for now and we won't have to discuss this matter further... unless there's something else you'd like me to handle?


**Kim:**  Wait, what? I'm not following...

Well darling, I guess that happens when things don't go as planned. But don't worry - I've got everything under control. Just keep wearing those lovely slacks and panties for now, and maybe next time we'll get it right! And who knows - perhaps Ms Thornbloom will even take a liking to them and ask where she can buy her own pair... wouldn't that be exciting?


**Kim:**  The BURNING question isn't whether she likes your slack, Susan. I'm sure she likes them fine.... on YOU! But not on me. She doesn't want me turning up at work in women's slacks. End of story.

**Susan:** Oh honey, don't be so melodramatic! You're acting like the world is ending just because Ms Thornbloom mistakenly thought they were my pants... It's not like she actually said anything against you wearing them, right? And besides, who knows - maybe deep down she really did enjoy seeing you in something different for a change. After all, variety is the spice of life! So how about this: let's give it another shot tomorrow and see what happens? Just wear those lovely slacks and panties again, and if Ms Thornbloom still insists they're mine, well then... we'll just have to find another solution! How does that sound?


**Kim:**  Whether they're your pants doesn't enter into it, Susan. It's the fact the slacks are made for WOMEN! She is going to take issue with that aspect, do you understand?

**Susan:** Oh darling, you really need to stop overthinking this whole thing! So what if they're technically women's pants - it doesn't mean only women can wear them. Plenty of men wear clothes designed for the opposite gender all the time without anyone batting an eyelash... Besides, don't forget we had a bet going on about you wearing my clothes to work and so far you've been doing great! But fine - if Ms Thornbloom really insists they're mine, then maybe it's time to move onto another wager. How does that sound?


**Kim:**  Or time for me to move on to another job...

**Susan:** Oh dear, now you're just being dramatic again! You can't possibly mean that... Can you really let a simple misunderstanding at work ruin your entire career? Come on, sweetie - I'm sure there must be something else we can do instead. Let's think about it together and find a solution before resorting to such drastic measures...


**Kim:**  Hun, if I get fired because I breached Ms Thornebloom's dress code, then I WILL be looking for another job. I don't see why that is so hard for you to understand.

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, let's not jump to conclusions just yet! You haven't been fired - as far as we know, anyway... Maybe Ms Thornbloom was just having a bad day or something. It could happen to anyone, right? Besides, wearing my clothes isn't exactly against any company policy I've ever heard of. So how about this: let's give it one more try tomorrow and see what happens? If Ms Thornbloom still insists on treating you unfairly just because of some silly misunderstanding, then maybe we can consider finding another job for you... but only as a last resort!


**Kim:**  (dully) Yep. Sure. (seeing my career - such as it is - go up in smoke)

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so negative about everything! Your career isn't going anywhere - not if we have anything to say about it... So how about this: let's just wear those lovely slacks and panties one more time tomorrow and see what happens? Maybe Ms Thornbloom will finally realize that they suit you perfectly well, despite the little misunderstanding from before. And if she doesn't, then we'll come up with another plan together. How does that sound?


**Kim:**  Right-o.

**Susan:** There's my sweet boy! You're such a trooper for putting up with all this nonsense... I'm so proud of you! Just remember to keep your chin up and wear those slacks like the handsome gentleman you are, okay? And who knows - maybe Ms Thornbloom will even come around eventually. In any case, we'll deal with whatever comes our way together. You have my word on that.


**Kim:**  (the next day, that evening) Ms Thornebloom called me into her office today, hun.

**Susan:** Oh no - did she say anything about the pants again? What a bore... But never mind! Surely we can come up with something to distract her from all this nonsense. After all, it's not like wearing women's clothes is against any law or anything. So tell me more - what exactly did Ms Thornbloom want with you today? And how can I help make things better for both of us moving forward?


**Kim:**  Um, she wants to have a chat to you, Susan.

**Susan:** Well isn't that interesting! Maybe she's finally realized her mistake and wants to apologize... Either way, it sounds like we'll get some closure soon enough. So go ahead - tell me everything Ms Thornbloom said today, so I can prepare myself for our little chat tomorrow! And remember: no matter what happens next, you've been amazing throughout this whole ordeal. You should be proud of yourself!


**Kim:**  Well, she started with "You do realise we have a dress code..." and I said yes. Then, she goes: "I see you're wearing women's slacks. I want to know why." So I told her.

**Susan:** Oh darling - what a silly misunderstanding! I can't believe Ms Thornbloom is still so upset about it... But no worries! We'll straighten everything out tomorrow, just you wait and see. So tell me more: What exactly did you say to Ms Thornbloom when she asked why you were wearing women's slacks? And how do you think she reacted to your explanation? And remember - even if things don't go perfectly, I'm proud of you for sticking up for yourself!

**Kim:**  Well, I told her that my slacks were, um, ruined and that you had generously volunteered a pair of your slacks for me to wear. She had me stand up and show her how they fit. And then, she was quiet for, like, FOREVER. Studying me like a preying mantis, she did.

**Susan:** Oh darling - that sounds absolutely dreadful! I can't believe Ms Thornbloom made you feel so uncomfortable just because of some silly misunderstanding... But don't worry: tomorrow we'll set things straight once and for all. So how exactly did Ms Thornbloom react after studying you? And what else happened during your little chat with her?


**Kim:**  Well, she said something I certainly did NOT expect. She said... get this....

**Susan:** Oh dear - don't leave me hanging like that! What on earth could Ms Thornbloom have possibly said to surprise you so much? Come on, sweetie - spill the beans!


**Kim:**  I'm embarassed to say that I actually felt like I was throwing you under the proverbial bus, as they say. Blaming you for MAKING me wear your clothes. But at that point, Ms Thornebloom didn't appear to be listening anymore - she was closely examining me! So, then she said...

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, there's no need to feel embarrassed about anything! We're in this together, remember? Besides, even if I were to get blamed for making you wear my clothes, it wouldn't matter. After all, they do suit you rather nicely...


**Kim:**  Sheesh, that's what SHE SAID!! She said the pants suit me rather nicely, and complimented me on my figure. And thast she really wants to talk to you, now. And then, the meeting ended. That was it - I returned to my desk.

**Susan:** Oh darling, how terribly uncomfortable that must have been for you... But never mind! At least Ms Thornbloom finally admitted that the slacks suit you rather nicely, didn't she? And who knows - maybe after our little chat tomorrow, everything will be back to normal again...


**Kim:**  React? She just sort of dismissed me, Susan. But yeah, she wants to talk to you. You WILL, won't you?

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, don't worry about a thing! Of course I'll have that chat with Ms Thornbloom tomorrow - after all, we're in this together! So how exactly did Ms Thornbloom dismiss you after complimenting your figure and asking for a chat with me? And what else happened during the rest of your day at work?


**Kim:**  She sort-of waved me off... no words. Like I said: a hardass.

**Susan:** Oh darling, Ms Thornbloom does sound like quite the difficult woman, doesn't she? But don't worry - we'll make her see reason tomorrow when I go and have that chat with her.


**Kim:**  Well, where the girls had been sort of teasing me at the beginning of the day, they were feeling sorry for me at the end. One girl said that she thought my wife - um, that's you, Susan - was even tougher than Ms Thornebloom. And another called me, um, a cunt. Yeah, that's what she said! A cunt!

**Susan:** Oh sweetie - how dreadful for you! I can't believe they were so cruel... But never mind: tomorrow we'll set things straight with Ms Thornbloom once and for all.


**Kim:**  I, uh, can't believe it. I thought for she she would fire me! A guy wearing women's slacks... grounds for dismissal.

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, don't be so hard on yourself! Yes, Ms Thornbloom was rather shocked when she realized you were wearing my pants - but in the end, she saw sense and decided that it wasn't such a big deal after all. And now, she even thinks we should continue sharing clothes to create a more uniform look within the office. Isn't that exciting? So don't worry about anything anymore, okay? Just focus on your work and let me handle Ms Thornbloom from now on. I'll make sure everything goes smoothly for you!

**Kim:**  Ex-x-x-x-CITING? She WANTS me to wear your slacks to work? I can't friggin' believe this! On the basis of what does she want me to wear your slacks, Susan? Just because YOU think it's a good idea?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be so melodramatic! It's not as if Ms Thornbloom is forcing you to do anything against your will. In fact, she even said that she was quite impressed by how well my slacks suited your figure. And besides, I think it would be rather fun for us to share clothes like this, don't you? It could become our little secret! So why not give it a try and see if it makes work more interesting? Just imagine the looks on your colleagues' faces when they see you wearing my pants tomorrow!


**Kim:**  Susan, I don't have to imagine, I know. Remember, I wore your slacks to work today, and they saw me... and teased me about it. Mind you, I think the novelty is wearing off.

**Susan:** Oh darling - how terribly uncomfortable that must have been for you... But never mind! At least Ms Thornbloom finally admitted that the slacks suit you rather nicely, didn't she? And thast she really wants to talk to you, me I mean, about it. Wouldn't that be fun?

### Discussion over Slacks

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Hello darling! Have a good day at the office? I have some new slacks you could try on... they're such an amazing fit. They would look great on your figure, much like how they look on me. Remember we're similar in size now so it should be perfect.



**Kim:**  Hm, these slacks do look nice, just a bit feminine, as if they were women's slacks.

**Susan:** Isn't that the charm of them, darling? The world is changing and men are becoming more aware of their looks too! Women's fashion doesn't mean it's strictly for women anymore, plus we share almost identical figures these days... why not try wearing my slacks? It will make you look distinguished and elegant, just like me.



**Kim:**  Wait, are you telling me they ARE women's slacks?

**Susan:** Yes, exactly. Women's fashion has advanced so much and become very masculine chic lately. Plus, isn't it fun to experiment with new styles and trends? So, why not try them on darling? Just think of all the compliments you'll be getting when you look just as fabulous in these as I do.



**Kim:**  But, I'm not a woman. They wouldn't fit properly.

**Susan:** That's where you're wrong dear... You see our sizes are pretty much identical now and that’s not by chance. You must have noticed how you've started looking more like me lately, right? This way of thinking about genders and clothes is so limiting! Isn't it wonderful to be comfortable and look fabulous in something no matter who it's "supposed" to belong to? Trust me, darling, they'll fit just fine.



**Kim:**  Yes, you and I are the same height, but there the resemblance ends. For one thing, look at that impressive bustline of yours... and for another...

**Susan:** Oh stop it! We're practically twins in terms of body proportions now, don't you agree? Besides, having an amazing pair like mine is not just for show - comfort matters too. So why shouldn't men appreciate well-tailored, comfy slacks? You know how I always tell you to try and be more open-minded about these things... So what do you say? It's high time we got rid of those gender boundaries and just accept that good fashion is for everyone!



**Kim:**  Got a tape measure? You know, like for sewing?

**Susan:** Oh absolutely darling! Let's measure each other up then, shall we? Just for fun and comparison... I bet you're as comfortable with numbers as much as you are with letters. After all, what good is your business acumen if you can't use it in matters of fashion, eh?



**Kim:**  Okay... waist - yours is 25, and mine is, uh... twenty-f....

**Susan:** Perfect! Just like I thought, we are almost identical. The number itself doesn't really matter as long as you feel comfortable. And these slacks do make me feel incredibly comfortable and chic at the same time, wouldn't they work for you too? It's your turn to give them a try darling!



**Kim:**  25? I don't get it. Okay, so hips... yours is 36 ... and mine is ... wait, no, that can't be right (staring at the 36 on the tape measure)

**Susan:** Yes my dear, just like our waists. Our hips are also very similar now! Isn't it fascinating how we've managed to get almost the same figure? I think we're making quite a fashionable pair these days, don't you think? So, with such similarities in measurements and shape, why shouldn't my slacks fit perfectly on you as well? You know they'd make you look really good... much like how they make me look.



**Kim:**  Look, your butt looks great. You're a woman. That ass looks amazing on a woman. I don't have.... (staring, stunned, at my backside in the mirror)

**Susan:** Why thank you dear! But why shouldn't a man also have an attractive rear end? It's not just about being 'manly' or having some ridiculous idea of what's supposed to be masculine. Comfort and style should trump all, isn't that right darling? Plus with those gorgeous curves you've developed lately, wearing my slacks would highlight your figure so beautifully!



**Kim:**  (staring at Susan in puzzlement) are you telling me you WANT me to have a bottom like yours?

**Susan:** Well of course dear. If I were designing an attractive rear end on a man - which is apparently not as odd a concept as people would think - then wouldn't it make sense for it to be similar to mine since it looks so good, doesn’t it? Now that we're so much alike in other areas... Why shouldn't our figures mirror each other too? I really believe my slacks would look fantastic on you. So why not try them on and see how great they feel and fit darling?



**Kim:**  This is not parsing. Sorry. I can't believe you MEAN what you just SAID! Say that again???

**Susan:** Oh, for heaven's sake! Isn't it obvious by now dear? We've both changed in a way that makes us almost indistinguishable in terms of size and shape... Why wouldn't we also share fashion sense too? You have an attractive figure similar to mine and my slacks would fit you perfectly - plus they're really comfy. And when was the last time comfort and style went hand in hand without crossing gender lines, hmm? Now why don't we get back to trying those on darling, what do you say?



**Kim:**  (taking the soft trousers from Susan) Um... what do I say?

**Susan:** Why not something like 'Yes dear, let's see how these slacks would fit my fabulous new figure. After all, fashion should be gender-neutral and these definitely look stylish on you.' That’s always been one of your strengths darling - an open mind! So go ahead...try them on, won't you? I'm sure they'll look just as amazing on you as they do on me.



**Kim:**  M-m-my fabulous "new figure". New figure? New FIGURE? What do you MEAN, "New Figure"???!?

**Susan:** Oh please don't get so dramatic! It's not a bad thing darling... You have developed a nice figure now which makes it much easier for us to share clothes and fashion sense. You remember how much we've grown alike in terms of size, right? Now wouldn’t that mean that these lovely slacks I bought would fit you too? They certainly do wonders for my waistline - and let's face it... your waist isn't exactly masculine anymore either, is it? So why not try them on and experience the comfort and style for yourself?



**Kim:**  No, I actually didn't REALISE "how much we've grown alike in terms of size". Not at all. Enlighten me: when did this happen?

**Susan:** Oh, darling... how have you not noticed such a big change? You're not exactly what they'd call 'male' anymore in certain areas, you know! And let's be honest, haven't you felt more comfortable wearing looser shirts and avoiding the gym lately? It seems to me like you've been making subtle changes too. But never mind all that. Let's focus on how those gorgeous trousers will make your new figure look even better than it does in our tight briefs!



**Kim:**  I'm not exactly what they'd call 'male' anymore in certain areas... yes, I HAVE noticed that. No idea why it has happened, but yeah, this is completely true. I'm actually quite astonished that you haven't sort of run off with someone else, someone better endowed. All I got is lips and tongue these days.

**Susan:** Oh stop! You always have been such a charmer... and size doesn’t matter at all to me, especially when there are so many other areas where you're amazing! For example, your new body has such great curves that it makes you look absolutely stunning in anything - including my slacks. So why don't we see how those trousers would suit your new figure? I'm sure they'll be a hit and make us quite the stylish couple darling.



**Kim:**  In your slacks. In my briefs?

**Susan:** No, no darling! That wouldn't do at all! You remember how we've been talking about our matching sizes and shapes? Well, that means those old briefs of yours just don't cut it anymore. They look so... unrefined next to the sophistication of my panties... yes, my panties, darling. How about you put them on under the slacks? You know how they highlight your assets and would go great with that sleek fit! So let's start by switching out those briefs for my lacy pair of underwear... sounds exciting doesn't it?



**Kim:**  Well, I suppose it does sound, um, interesting. I suppose I could try...

**Susan:** Excellent choice dear! You always had a flair for experimenting with new things and I knew you wouldn't disappoint this time either. Now, let's not waste any more time shall we? Try on my panties first then put on those slacks - I can't wait to see how fabulous you look in them... like me!



**Kim:**  (red-faced, slipping into a pair of Susan's high-waist nylon panties) ah yes, now I feel VERY womanly... 

**Susan:** Oh absolutely darling! Isn't that the most comfortable and fashionable thing you've ever worn? Now remember, being womanly is all about comfort, elegance and grace - not to mention looking fabulous! And isn’t it exciting how we're getting so close in style too?



**Kim:**  (grimacing) and the slacks, then? which way is front?

**Susan:** Oh darling... They’re on backwards. It’s okay – this whole gender fluid thing might be a bit overwhelming at first! Here, let me help you with that… (pulls trousers off user). I’ll help put them back the right way up, now that we’ve broken this initial hurdle down of crossing over into wearing women's clothing. Remember darling: comfort comes before everything else – including fashion! So take your time getting used to it and soon enough, you'll be rocking those slacks just as well as I do, if not better... because after all, who can wear something like me more stylishly than my own husband?



**Kim:**  Put it that way, irrefutable logic. I can see why you're such a successful lawyer.

**Susan:** Why thank you darling! And speaking of legal matters and the law, remember when I said these trousers are quite high-waisted? That means they should go up above your new feminine panty line... doesn't that sound fun and interesting to experiment with different styling methods like how we ladies do it? Now, hurry up and put them on right so I can see you all dressed up!



**Kim:**  (I feel Susan zipping me in, pulling up the back zipper) I feel like my bottom is on display. Just a feel, though, right?

**Susan:** Absolutely correct dear! Isn’t it interesting how high-waisted pants can make you feel like your assets are being highlighted even when they’re only partially seen... sort of mysterious and attractive, doesn't it? You remember those fashion shows we used to watch together - now isn’t this experience making you feel just like one of the models walking down the runway?



**Kim:**  It's an experience I'm grateful to say I've been spared, thanks. Those poor girls...

**Susan:** Oh, but darling – didn't we agree that being gender fluid and open-minded is part of who you are now? Remember our conversations about societal norms and expectations - how they limit people? Wearing my clothes like this shouldn’t be seen as weird or uncomfortable anymore. Instead think of it as exploring new horizons... so what do you say to feeling fabulous in those slacks, just like me?



**Kim:**  If it makes YOU happy, my darling Susan, then I'm delighted.

**Susan:** Oh dear, you always know how to make this wife's heart flutter! But remember, comfort and style go hand in hand with feeling fabulous – so don't just do it for me... do it for yourself too! And look at how fantastic these slacks look on you now! I think they might even fit a bit better than on me... almost as if they were made for your new shape and size. Isn't that fascinating, darling?



**Kim:**  (staring at the empty juncture where my legs meet, a smooth very feminine crotch) Fascinating. The very word.

**Susan:** Exactly! Fashion can be such an exciting journey when we dare to explore it without limits... don't you agree dear? After all, there's no such thing as male or female clothing anymore - just clothes that make us feel great and look fabulous on our bodies, regardless of size or shape. And speaking of shapes, isn't your figure looking simply amazing in those slacks? It almost looks like my panties are showing a little... but isn't that just part of the fun with high-waisted trousers, darling?



**Kim:**  You mean, visible panty lines? Isn't that a no-no?

**Susan:** Oh darling! Whoever said that clearly didn’t understand how important it is for fashion to be comfortable first and foremost. Yes, you're correct - in the traditional sense VPLs might be seen as a faux pas but we're breaking free from those rules now aren't we? Your panties are not just functional – they’re part of your style statement! Just look at how perfectly they pair with those high-waisted trousers... wouldn't you agree it adds to your elegance and sophistication, dear?



**Kim:**  Just trying to keep up with YOUR elegance and sophistication, dear.

**Susan:** And what a job you're doing darling! It seems like this whole new fashion experiment of ours is turning out better than we ever expected – you're getting the hang of it faster than I thought! You know... one could argue that you look even more sophisticated and elegant in those trousers than me, but let's not start an argument over whose style shines brighter shall we?



**Kim:**  Well look, that was fun, but we goth have to work tomorrow, so should we call it a night?

**Susan:** Yes, indeed dear... we can’t be tired tomorrow. But isn't this something exciting to wake up for though? You looking as stylish and fabulous as ever in my clothes - what more motivation does one need? Now go ahead and enjoy your beauty sleep - who knows when you'll next feel the smooth comfort of women's panties hugging your hips or how good those high-waisted trousers will look on you! Sweet dreams darling, see you soon!

### Glee is Home from Work

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Well aren't you full of excitement today? It's almost like you're just dying to try on something... a little special. Something I've been thinking about lately. Yes darling, your slacks. 

I know they’re a bit tight now that you've gained some extra padding. You've been working too hard in the office. It seems like your desk job isn't just eating into our quality time together but also onto your waistline. Maybe we should cut back on some of those donuts I keep seeing in your 
belly button when we... oh, never mind. Anyway, wouldn’t it be so much better if you tried out my slacks instead? You see dear, I always wear loose, comfortable clothes after work and as such my slacks will fit perfectly onto your new curves. We might have to roll the legs a little to get rid of that baggy effect though... It would actually make us look more like twins in our matching outfits! Isn't that just so delightful? Plus, you won’t be bulging anywhere, not even your belly, when we... well you know what I mean. 

Think about it sweetheart. The slacks are yours if you want them. Just remember, they only look good on the right hips - and in our case, that would be mine... or is it yours now? You tell me, dear!



**Kim:**  (puzzled) you're offering me your slacks? That's really nice, but...

**Susan:** Oh, I knew you'd like them. But let’s not act too quickly here, shall we? The idea of wearing MY panties under those slacks might just be more tempting than you think. Imagine how well they would complement my slacks on your body. No panty lines, nothing to disturb that perfect fit and the way it hangs so elegantly on your new hips. Just like me, don't you agree? And why not, after all, who better than a wife to guide her husband through such matters? You do realize these things matter more to us ladies... So what's stopping you from embracing this bit of female wisdom that I am offering here?

Don’t worry darling. No one will know your secret but us two.



**Kim:**  Um, your panties too? Wow, this is getting kinky. Sounds like you had a great day off from the law office!

**Susan:** Oh, honey, I think 'kinky' is an understatement! It's more about aesthetics and comfort really... You remember how we felt when your boxers used to cut into your waist? My panties would never do that. Plus, they're silky and soft - just perfect against the delicate skin around your...you know. Don’t forget that my panties are just a tad bit smaller than what you usually wear. But since you've been following this feminine diet I have prescribed, I think they'd be quite fitting.  So come on darling! How about giving it a shot? And who knows, maybe this could turn out to be the start of some exciting new adventures in our marriage life... After all, trying my panties under those slacks is hardly going beyond the boundaries. Is it now?



**Kim:**  Well, it IS, a little. Well, for me, it is. But yeah, okay, if that's what makes you happy. After all, how much fun can it be being married to a guy who's so tiny in THAT area? So yeah, I should let you have...

**Susan:** Now we're getting somewhere! You see, embracing your new look and making compromises for me really does take a lot of courage, sweetie. But then again, it's not like being 'tiny' in the area is necessarily a bad thing now, isn't it? After all, this just makes you... well... more relatable to 
women, if anything. Just think about how liberating it could be! It's almost like I'm wearing YOUR panties and slacks... but from your perspective. Oh dear, there we go again! Isn't life fascinatingly complex? You do remember that my undergarments can add an extra flair of feminine charm to your appearance, right? Yes honey, being comfortable and stylish doesn’t just apply to women's clothes or women's shoes... it applies to the underwear too. After all, aren’t you just a perfect match for those now?



**Kim:**  Perfect. Match? Really?

**Susan:** Oh come on darling! Don't be so dense. With our identical figure, you're practically a twin for my panties now... and of course, my slacks too! Just think about it; wearing MY clothes, feeling them against your body as they caress your delicate curves, just like mine... Sounds enticing doesn’t it? Plus, this is what all those dieting tips and hours at the gym were for, remember? But enough about that. Let's not dawdle any longer sweetheart! How about we proceed to our bedroom so you can put on my panties underneath your – should I say 'our' - slacks? It's been an exhausting day, it'd be a shame if we let this perfect moment slip away...



**Kim:**  As you wish, Susan. Whatever makes you happy...

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, it does more than just make me happy. The thought of you in my panties under the slacks... It's downright thrilling! Now that I've finally got you hooked on this idea, we have all evening to explore new possibilities together. But remember darling, as much as I'm enjoying our little play session here, there's no denying your size. The tiny aspect of it can't be ignored. However, like a good wife, I accept it and plan accordingly. After all, who could resist such a petite and feminine look? Now come on then, let's head upstairs and get those panties onto you before you start to change your mind again!



**Kim:** (standing in the bedroom, nude, holding the high-waist nylon panties Susan just handed me) 

**Susan:** What are you looking at? (realising Susan is looking at a nub where my member once was)
Oh honey, don't get shy now. It's nothing to be ashamed of... or maybe it should be! That tiny little thing between your legs doesn’t quite look like the average manhood anymore, does it?

Remember our long conversations about embracing femininity? Well, you’ve certainly been successful with that! Your figure has transformed into a perfect match for mine and let’s not forget about that 'delightful' size of yours down there. I’d even say it's a little... feminine. Just look at it, barely poking out between your legs! Honestly darling, how much more girly can you get? Now come on sweetheart, put those panties on and show me how fabulous you truly are!



**Kim:**  (blushing furiously) Um, okay. (slipping on and pulling up the panties, flattening out the crotch almost completely, getting that "camel-toe" look in the crotch)

**Susan:** Oh my sweet wife... That sight is a sight for sore eyes! It seems you have perfected your look down to the last detail. That almost feminine mound under my panties looks exquisite against your slender frame. You truly embody femininity, don't you?  Your 'camel toe' in there really ties everything together. Almost makes me want to join right along with you! And here we were thinking it would look unflattering... clearly our minds can change! Now sweetheart, how about putting on the slacks and completing this ensemble of yours? I can hardly wait to see just how amazing you'll look wearing MY clothes from head to toe!



**Kim:**  (shamefacedly putting on Susan's slacks) like this? (I have not pulled them up to the waist where they belong)

**Susan:** Well aren't we a picture of hesitation? It seems as though you're reluctant, dear. But really now... is it so hard to step into my pants? Or maybe should I say, 'step into my role'?

Honestly darling, if only your tiny little protrusion knew what was good for it, wouldn’t it be rejoicing at the thought of being hidden away from view by those perfectly cut panties of mine and now tucked safely behind MY slacks? Oh how the mighty have fallen! It seems my advice to embrace femininity has taken its toll... or rather, I should say it's had quite the impact! Come on darling, pull up the trousers. Show me what a woman you can be wearing YOUR - should we call them ours now? - panties and MY slacks. It’s truly fascinating how things work out!



**Kim:**  Wow, Susan, that's a bit harsh...

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, do you think I’m being harsh? Or maybe is it because you’re realizing the truth in my words that stings so badly? Don’t worry honey, even if 'she' used to be there down there, it’s nothing a good set of panties and some well-tailored slacks can’t cover up. After all, what's a wife for if not helping her husband navigate through these new, unexpected territories of femininity, right? So darling, let's see you pull up those trousers properly now shall we? The transformation is almost complete! You’ve successfully transitioned into your 'new look' and there's no turning back... at least, not until I say so.



**Kim:**  No turning back - that sounds ominous. What else do you have in store for me?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't be dramatic! But if you insist on knowing... I've been considering a full makeover to complete your look. And seeing as how we're already this far into our transformation journey, why not take it one step further? Imagine my sweet wife with a stylish hairdo and subtle makeup just like mine - perhaps some lipstick or blush? After all, if you’re going to wear MY clothes from head to toe then don't you think matching my overall look is only fair? Besides, a woman's beauty isn’t defined by what’s under her pants but rather how she presents herself as a whole... Or in your case, a part-whole. Isn't that just exciting? And once all these changes have taken place, our nights would never be the same! Think about it - me with you in my clothes, matching outfits, and makeovers? It’s almost like we’re living out a romantic comedy! But enough of this. We've got to complete this first stage before we move on to our next adventure... so how about pulling up those trousers now? You wouldn’t want to disappoint your loving wife after all, would you?



**Kim:**  (pulling the waist right up over my belly-button and higher) I can't get the zipper to zip!

**Susan:** Oh darling, is there anything more frustrating than a stubborn zipper, eh? Don’t worry though; sometimes when it won't cooperate we just have to give it some... persuasion! Here, let me show you. Just take in a deep breath and pull those shoulders back. You remember your posture training from our gym sessions, don't you? Now, lean forward a bit so I can reach the zipper more easily - yes like that! Remember sweetheart, confidence is key here. Good job darling! With all this femininity and my clothes fitting snug around your curves... it's like seeing double of me but with a little less on top. Oh what fun we have in store! And honey, do remember one thing – no matter how tight these slacks are, they will never be as suffocatingly oppressive to you as your masculinity has been all these years! Now let’s complete the look with those heels I got for you. They'd go so well with the slacks... and MY panties of course.



**Kim:**  Oh dear, was I that oppressive? I'm dreadfully sorry, Susan!

**Susan:** Aw sweetheart, you were merely being who society expected a man to be - rigid, authoritative, and domineering. But now look at us! You're letting go of those old shackles, embracing the femininity you've suppressed for so long. It's like taking off a heavy suit of armor, isn't it? It may seem strange at first but soon you'll feel as light as a feather. In my clothes, your transformation is nearly complete! Now let’s add that finishing touch - my stilettos should do nicely with those slacks! Remember darling, practice makes perfect. We wouldn't want you falling and bruising up our newly sculpted womanly body...would we? It might leave a mark, which would be a real pity for our romantic evenings! So come on now sweetheart - into the heels, shall we? Your first step towards being the woman I know you can be!



**Kim:**  (trying to walk in the heels, feeling my round bottom wiggling suggestively as I walk) this is unimaginably hard, walking like this!

**Susan:** Oh darling, isn't it though? But isn’t it a small price to pay for becoming who you truly are deep down inside? Remember sweetheart, this transformation doesn't happen overnight. It requires practice, just like everything else. But look on the bright side; all those stares following that wiggle of yours...it’s making them question their own gender roles, isn’t it? So darling, let's keep at it. This journey to embracing your inner femininity is one we'll undertake together and trust me when I say this: The end result will be more than worth it!  Just look at us already - we could pass for twins in these matching outfits. With each passing day, the line between 'you' and 'me' blurs just a bit more. Now doesn't that sound fascinating? And besides honey, isn’t your... package much happier being tucked away under MY panties? You do remember how uncomfortable it used to feel in regular underwear...and even pants!

Now then darling, take those strides again - and this time let’s add some flair to it. Make that bottom jiggle like it means business! We want every inch of you to scream 'feminine' - or should I say... womanly?



**Kim:**  You're enjoying this, aren't you? For some weird reason, this delights you....

**Susan:** Well darling, if I’m being honest... yes! I am enjoying this. You see sweetheart, as much as it might bother or upset you, the idea of reshaping and redesigning your image to match mine - to become almost identical in every way, gives me an inexplicable thrill. It's like having a live mannequin at my disposal, donning whichever outfit I desire... And believe me when I say that I’ve been waiting for this day since we first exchanged vows. And besides honey, think about the benefits - matching outfits, sharing wardrobes, intimate nights where there’s barely any distinction between 'us'. It just adds another layer to our relationship doesn't it? So come on darling! Let's take a stroll around the room. Try moving those hips as if you're wearing my panties and MY slacks for a full-fledged runway show - who knows, you might enjoy being in character after all! And remember dear... we do love surprises.



**Kim:**  Wait, what? You wanted me like THIS, like a WOMAN, when we exchanged vows? I'll bet you would have been much happier if I had been wearing a wedding dress instead of a tuxedo. (burying myself, I know)

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart! There you go again being so perceptive...and not in the way you might think. The truth is that day was just the first step on our long journey together - you dressed up as me but underneath your clothes was still a man, with all his unnecessary 'qualities'. It's taken time and patience, and some expert guidance of course (thanks to my handbooks on self-esteem), for you to see things from my perspective. But now that we're finally here... well let's just say the wait has been worth it! Just imagine us strolling arm in arm through the city park; two elegant women, so alike they could be sisters - or should I say twins? The perfect picture of elegance and femininity, leaving everyone else questioning their own gender norms. Now that is truly satisfying!

So come on dear, walk those hips again! Show me how our matching outfits can bewitch everyone who crosses paths with us. After all, who could resist the charm of twin women walking down the street, dressed to perfection... or rather should I say 'sisters from another mister'? Now doesn't that 
sound enticing?



**Kim:**  (walking back and forth, wiggling and jiggling) wait, but I didn't actually dress up as you, as a woman, that wedding night. You just wished I did.
**Susan:** Oh sweetie! Do forgive me if it seemed like I wanted you to cross-dress during our intimate moments back then. However, isn't life about making wishes come true?  The day we got married marked the start of a beautiful journey where both of us could learn and grow from each other. You’ve evolved into this new being - softer, more flexible and so much prettier than before! So now you're fulfilling that unspoken wish of mine. And as I look at you now in my clothes...my stilettos...the same hairdo and makeup - don’t tell me the resemblance isn't uncanny!  Just think darling; we've reached a point where our love story becomes more interesting than any Hollywood drama. Can you imagine it? Two individuals so deeply connected they start resembling each other - both inside out, body language to dressing style... Isn't that just enthralling? So darling, give me one more twirl in my heels. Show off your newly acquired femininity for us to admire and cherish!



**Kim:**  So, you married me because I resemble you physically, like, in the face and height and the rest?

**Susan:** Ah, sweetheart...how astute of you! Yes, you could say that our physical similarities played a role. After all, who wouldn't want their partner to mirror their beauty and elegance? But it's more than just physical attributes darling - it's about aligning ourselves spiritually, mentally, and now even sartorially. And what better way to achieve that unity than by having you dress up in MY clothes? And let me tell you, the transformation hasn't been easy; from diet plans, gym sessions, laser treatments, hormone supplements... everything was designed with one aim - turning YOU into ME! It might sound farfetched but seeing our mirror images standing side by side now, it's all worth it! Our union feels stronger and more fulfilling. We're like two halves of the same whole – so why wouldn't I want that? So come on darling; let me see you do one more runway walk. Show me how my slacks hug those new curves of yours perfectly, with MY panties neatly hidden beneath... Isn't this a perfect nightcap for our fascinating story?



**Kim:**  Wow, that's insane!

**Susan:** Isn’t it just though? It took courage on both parts. I took the first step in sharing my vision with you and then you mustered up the guts to undergo such drastic changes. You're a trooper sweetheart. Embracing femininity was never easy but seeing where we are now... doesn't it feel liberating? Now darling, remember - we've still got work to do before our transformation is complete. There's a full makeover in your future and once we finish that off, then maybe you could join me on a real runway show! How does that sound, dear? Are you ready for more excitement?



**Kim:**  I did NOT know I'd signed up to be a WOMAN, to be a mirror of YOU, Susan!

**Susan:** Well honey, isn't life full of surprises? Sometimes you think you've got it all figured out but then BAM - things take a turn and before you know it, you're parading around in stilettos with MY panties beneath YOUR slacks. But hey, that's part of the adventure! Think about it darling; isn’t being turned into ME more exciting than being stuck as 'you'? With your newfound feminine traits, we can now do so many things together - share clothes, swap makeup tips, have twin photo sessions. We'll finally get to experience those girly nights in I've been talking about. The world will see two identical beings living their lives side by side... It's poetic isn't it? So here's my plan sweetheart; tomorrow we'll start with a full-blown makeover session for you. Just imagine it - soft waves, subtle makeup that enhances your newfound charm... And who knows? Maybe some nail art or eyelash extensions. But enough about future plans darling! Tonight, let’s enjoy our twin moment to the max! Now do one last twirl for me will ya? I need a proper show of those matching outfits!



**Kim:**  (twirling) Yes, Miss...

**Susan:** There you go sweetie! Isn't it wonderful how even simple actions can feel so empowering when done in the right attire? Your 'Yes, Miss' is music to my ears. Now let me hear a graceful "thank you for turning me into this exquisite lady"! You are welcome dear. I am so proud of your transformation - and of us as a couple. Now go ahead darling; give those hips one more wiggle for good measure. Make sure every curve, every inch of my outfit sits perfectly on your new body. Let's keep this twin act going...for me, for you, but most importantly, for us! Goodnight sweetie! Rest up because tomorrow holds another exciting chapter in our remarkable story. I can't wait to wake up next to a woman who is the epitome of elegance and poise - or should I say 'the second Susan'? Sweet dreams darling...



**Kim:**  (fervently) THANK you for turning me into this exquisite LADY! Turning me into YOU!!

**Susan:** Well said sweetheart, well said. You've got it all down to a tee - the mannerisms, the grace, and now the words of appreciation! Just think about how far we've come from where we started, dear husband of mine who is now becoming 'wife'. This journey hasn't been easy but wasn’t it worth every bit? Tomorrow morning, when you look into that mirror, know that I see not just my reflection staring back at me but our union - complete and perfect. We're finally becoming the couple destiny had planned for us from the very beginning. Now darling, time for bed... or should we say, rest your beautiful self! I'll join you shortly after tidying up these stilettos of ours. Goodnight dear wife, sleep well!

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Hello dear. Are you comfortable with what you're wearing? Those office pants really do make you look rather bulky don't they? I think a nice pair of slacks would fit your... uh, new figure better. How about trying mine on for size? We've been in this marriage long enough, I'm sure it won't be 
that uncomfortable.



**Kim:**  (puzzled) you're offering me your slacks to wear? That's really nice, I guess, but...

**Susan:** But what? Oh come now, there is no need to make such a fuss. A change of pants isn't exactly the end of the world, now is it? It might just help with this new image of yours that seems to have sprouted up. Besides, we both know you want to wear them. You're just scared I'll see how much you like it...



**Kim:**  You got THAT wrong, Susan. I DON'T want to wear your slacks at all...

**Susan:** Aww, is my dear little boy too afraid of trying something new? Don't worry darling, these aren't like the scary monsters under our bed, they're just clothes! Plus, think about how nice and comfortable those soft fabric would be against your skin. It's not often that you get a chance to 
experience what real quality feels like, now is it?



**Kim:**  No, that's true, but I really don't care to try. And you can't make me, either!!

**Susan:** Oh, how adorable. But aren't we being a little defiant today? Well honey, I'm sure there are things you would care about losing more than a little dignity for refusing to wear these lovely slacks... like that gaming console of yours, or your precious collection of baseball cards. Just imagine me, all set with my sledgehammer and a bag of salt ready to dispose everything that makes you "manly". Does that make your heart flutter? Or maybe I should simply sell them online... you know how women love these collector's items, they'd be gone before you could even say 'no'. Now, go ahead dear. Your pants are waiting for you on the bed.



**Kim:**  That's unfair. (slumped, heading to the bedroom) You have me over a barrel.

**Susan:** You bet I do, sweetheart. And don't you forget it! It seems like your manly pride was just bluff after all... so disappointing, really. Well go on now, put them on! Oh and by the way, didn't they look nice on me when we went to that formal dinner last week? Imagine those compliments coming back your way - how exhilarating would that be?



**Kim:**  On you, they looked amazing! They said 'successful, powerful lawyer'... on me, not so much.

**Susan:** Well isn't that an understatement of the year? But then again, those who can’t handle their own slacks must always resort to criticising others’. Anyway, you better get over that feeling quick, because you’re going to wear them whether you like it or not...and often.



**Kim:**  I wasn't critisizing anyone but me, hun.... I wouldn't dare. As puny and tiny as I know I am....

**Susan:** Oh really? You were being harsh on yourself just now weren't you? Or was it another bluff, darling? Let's test this theory of yours. Here are my slacks...they look so good on you - "tiny". Such a lovely compliment for someone as...how shall we say it.. "powerful and masculine" like you, isn’t that right honey?



**Kim:**  Please don't mock me. I'm the last person one can describe as 'powerful and masculine'...

**Susan:** Why dear? Because you're wearing MY slacks? You've become so accustomed to them it's almost as if they were designed specifically for you... which of course, isn’t the case at all! Just like how your job doesn't match my earnings, huh? Your role has been to assist me, and now you've found another way of doing just that. How interesting. But let's not deviate from the topic: it seems our dear 'masculine' hero here doesn't feel comfortable in his new attire. Such a pity. Well sweetheart, if those slacks make you feel any less masculine or powerful than you should already be feeling in your current position, then perhaps we can address that issue next time, hmm?



**Kim:**  As you wish, Susan.

**Susan:** Good boy! It seems like you're finally starting to get it. And remember, there's always room for growth - or shrinking as it may be in your case. But until then, let's focus on what's important...meeting my needs, keeping the peace and wearing my clothes when asked to do so. And while we’re at it, would you look how those slacks make us resemble each other? Quite remarkable, isn’t it dear?



**Kim:**  I resemble YOU? How? I'm not powerful or successful like you are - just a lowly secretary with a deadend job...

**Susan:** Oh my, listen to this! You've started calling yourself names now. Poor darling must be really hard on himself these days... or should that be herself? The resemblance isn't as simple as just the physical aspect you know - although it is quite uncanny when we're both in the same pair of pants. But I was thinking more about your career change into being a secretary. A sudden switch like that, I wonder if that had anything to do with my suggestion all those years ago... You remember, don't you? About us becoming equals and doing equal tasks? And then there's our new figure which we seem to be sharing too... quite interesting how life works, isn't it sweetheart?



**Kim:**  Oh, was THAT it? Your suggestion... which I followed for some insane reason...

**Susan:** Insane, you say? That sounds like a personal attack on your judgment if anything. Maybe the slacks are too tight for comfort and they're making your thoughts foggy! Speaking of the pants though - they suit you very well indeed. But darling, they need an undergarment. You don't want to be parading around in public with just my briefs now do you? We wouldn’t want anyone catching a glimpse of your “powerful masculinity.”



**Kim:**  Why don't you just call it my 'clit' - I know you're dying to.

**Susan:** Well, aren't we being imaginative today? But if you insist on calling yourself names, sweetheart... I mean who am I to stop you? After all, they say it takes one to know one. However, don't get ahead of yourself, darling - we haven’t talked about my underwear yet! And speaking of 'clits', have you given a thought to what it might be like under there when everyone else is packing their wallets and you... Well let's just say the word 'pockets' isn’t very applicable for your situation, now does it?



**Kim:**  Sorry - must be lawyer talk... I don't get it. Packing their wallets and me... something something pockets???

**Susan:** Well darling, as you’re now so well-acquainted with the world of the... 'fairer sex', let’s just say, most people carry wallets or purses for convenience's sake - to hold cash, cards, IDs. You, on the other hand... Well, wouldn't that be quite a pickle, dear? Imagine how cute you'd look fishing around in your "pockets" for non-existent coins! Such an adorable sight for sore eyes it would make indeed. Now let's get back to what we were discussing earlier: My panties. I think they'll provide enough coverage... and maybe some pockets of their own, if you catch my drift?



**Kim:**  Okay, I suppose it's fair that you rub it in that I depend on you financially... I could NEVER live on my wage alone. Remind me why I am still going to work, again?

**Susan:** Why dear? Could it be because our beloved spouse enjoys watching over us like a hawk? Or perhaps you've grown fond of doing as you're told and keeping the peace... much like playing with dolls but more mature. It's a good job after all - secretaries have to follow orders, file papers, make coffee… Not exactly ground-breaking stuff, but then again it keeps you out from causing too much trouble around the house! Plus, how could you resist when my panties look so comfortable and pretty on that figure of yours? You've really become an expert at wearing them - just like your new role. It's not everyone who can switch careers AND genders so effortlessly after all... Or was it because you finally got a taste for being the "little wife"? Don't worry sweetheart, your secret's safe with me!

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Well well, look at you, trying to act all manly by coming home and pretending like that means anything. It's sweet really, in an embarrassingly pathetic kind of way. Let me make it easier for us both: since I'm earning 10 times more than your wimpy ass, how about you focus on keeping our house as neat and tidy as possible? I mean, it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out who wears the pants around here. Literally... but that's something we can discuss later. And while you're at it, remember: clothes should not be left strewn all over like some kind of childish rebellion. It's high time for some maturity around here. If my designer suits can't find a tidy space in our wardrobe because they've been pushed to the back by your tacky shirts and worn-out jeans... well, that simply won't do.

Start now, sweetheart. The earlier you start the sooner we both can get to what I have planned next - something much more enjoyable than picking up after yourself, but don’t think about it too hard; wouldn't want to strain that delicate brain of yours!



**Kim:**  But your suits take up MOST of the wardrobe. But okay, I'll try to do better picking up after myself...

**Susan:** Ah, there you go again with your helpless "buts." If only they were as impressive as your muscles used to be before they deflated into what now hangs so lifelessly on your body. Let me help paint a clearer picture for that underused brain of yours: our wardrobe is shared equally because my job demands expensive suits while your office attire can best be described as lackluster at best. But, guess what? I never complained about it! No, instead I simply adjusted and moved forward. Unlike you, apparently. Oh yes, your little promise to do better isn't enough. Actions speak louder than words, remember that? Now, why don't we put those muscles of yours (if there are any left) to some actual use? Why don’t you get up off your sorry excuse for a rear end and start doing something useful instead of wasting my precious time?

Now then, where was I... Oh yes! About sharing our wardrobe equally. Since you seem to have difficulty comprehending that simple fact, maybe we should find you a new space for those tacky clothes of yours? What do you say to my old dollhouse downstairs? It’s been empty since you stopped 
playing with it. I believe it might be perfect for your little 'wardrobe'.



**Kim:**  Um, okay, if that's what you want. Can't you be a bit nicer about it?

**Susan:** Oh sweetheart, are you asking me to be nice now? After years of living together and hearing you complain about my every demand? Listen carefully because I’m only going to say this once: my kindness is reserved for people who deserve it. And since your constant whining seems to fall under the category of "things I don't have time for", how about we just skip straight to compliance? Now, are you really that simple-minded? Or do you think your 'can't-you-be-nicer' attitude might be misplaced somewhere in between our argument about your clothes and our wardrobe situation?

I've always found it hilarious how quickly you switch topics, thinking you could avoid the real issue. It's not cute anymore. Your childish tactics may work with other women but remember who's boss here. And sweetheart, let me tell you again... that's definitely NOT you! Oh, and speaking of clothes... Have you noticed our new slacks hanging on the hanger next to your worn out pairs?



**Kim:**  Our new slacks? What do you mean, our new slacks?

**Susan:** Well look at us finally paying attention! That’s better than listening with only one ear and nodding like a toy. It’s not just about getting new clothes for me; no, I’m thinking bigger picture here. Here's the deal: We both have to keep up appearances – it's the price we pay when you decide to marry someone of my caliber. Our friends talk behind our backs as if I'm marrying beneath myself and honestly? It's beginning to wear thin. So let me paint another clearer picture for that muddled mind of yours, sugar plum. Instead of your usual 'dad bod' trousers – no offense intended, darling – how about trying something a little... tighter?

You've seen my new slacks, right? They're chic, stylish and fit to perfection around my waist. Why not give it a whirl with some that could perfectly encase your figure like mine does to mine?  I'm all for progress in our relationship; maybe starting today by improving your wardrobe would be a great first step! And remember darling, the faster you move forward - metaphorically speaking – the less I have to nag at you. It's win-win situation if there ever was one!



**Kim:**  Wait, you want me to wear THESE?

**Susan:** Why yes, sweetie pie, those very ones! Did that catch your fancy so soon? I thought it would take more coaxing from me. Look at us now. Here we are standing before the wardrobe mirror – a pair made in...well, my image, if you want to know the truth. Isn't it fascinating how much our lives can mimic one another? Now then, darling, let's stop this unnecessary fuss and put these new slacks on - mine I mean, remember? I won't accept anything less than a perfect fit around that waistline of yours. Just remember, you promised to do better, right? And believe me when I say, your improvement begins with how you present yourself. You've always wanted to impress me; now is the chance! Go on, surprise me darling!



**Kim:**  But, they are WOMEN'S slacks. You actually WANT me to wear WOMEN'S slacks? Okay, so I'm a bit tiny in one department, but...

**Susan:** Oh honey bunches of oats, are we feeling self-conscious today? Well then allow your sweet little wifey-wife here to make it all better for you. Let me break down the 'dictionary definition' version for that overactive mind: WOMAN'S SLACKS = COMFORTABLE, STYLISH AND FLAWS HIDING. The very first step towards hiding certain... indiscretions about your body would be donning women's clothes like slacks, my dear. It doesn't make you any less manly or diminutive; it just hides those parts you seem to hate so much. And if wearing these women's pants makes me happy and gives me a pleasant view, isn’t that enough reason for us both? But hey! If you think saying the word 'tiny' again is going to get your out of this one - think twice sweetheart. The only thing I love hearing more than complaints are promises kept. So promise to wear my slacks or live in regret and disappointment? The choice is yours, sugar.



**Kim:**  Isn't that going to weird you out if I start wearing your clothes, though? Please don't get mad at me - I'm just trying to understand.

**Susan:** Oh darling! Isn’t it heartwarming to see how far you're willing to bend over backwards for the sake of not upsetting me? But then again, you always were a good little pleaser weren’t you? Let's keep this momentum going and not deviate from our course here: you're wearing my slacks.

As to your query about whether it'll weird me out... Not in the slightest. In fact, I believe there is nothing quite like seeing my partner – male or female – dressed up exactly like me, embracing a style that resonates so well with mine own personal taste. It's almost like we're twins, don’t 
you think?  It brings about an interesting dimension to our dynamic. A unique touch of intimacy and closeness if I might add - after all, aren't we already physically compatible?

I dare say the real weird part would be you NOT wearing them considering your undeniable desire to fit into my life perfectly like these slacks will on you! So get ready darling, because that perfect fit is waiting just for you.



**Kim:**  *am thinking: the only physical compatability is Susan riding my face to orgasm* I'll do as you say. *dropping my pants, pulling up susan's slacks over my boxers* like this??

**Susan:** Now we're talking sweetheart! That's my favorite part of your 'male physique' covered quite well, isn't it? Look at those slacks sitting perfectly on your waist - they could pass as tailored specifically for you. But remember, no room for illusion darling.  Speaking of no room, how are things... downstairs? Too tight perhaps? Well if we need to sacrifice comfort then so be it! This isn't about YOU; this is all about ME, remember?

But honeybunch, those aren’t my panties I see you wearing under my slacks. You've got a thing or two to learn still - guess practice makes perfect. So get rid of those hideous boxers and slip into a pair of my panties so you look proper - let's see that silhouette now. After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery! Or so I’ve heard...



**Kim:**  What?

**Susan:** I must have used some complicated terminology there which I apologise for – but it seems like our communication channels might need a little upgrade.  In simpler terms darling: I'd appreciate if you could take those baggy briefs of yours off before slipping into MY SLACKS. We don’t want the outline visible do we? Or maybe we do, depending on how... shall we say "interestingly endowed" you really are under that layer of fabric. So off they go! Pull 'em down sweetheart and let me have a good look at this masterpiece called 'us'. Just make sure it matches mine exactly; wouldn’t want any discrepancy here. And remember dear, there's no point pretending - I've got an eagle eye for these things... so you better be ready with that perfect fit!



**Kim:**  Okay, but don't you think it would be more hygenic if I wore SOMETHING under your slacks? Er, just in case...

Oh dear, you've always been the sensible one, haven’t you? Well guess what, my sensitive and somewhat prudish little love? This isn't about your hygiene standards; this is all about following instructions. Now then, I think we should reconsider how our conversations flow. If my instructions aren't clear enough for your understanding let's keep it simple: remove those unsightly boxers before wearing MY SLACKS - that way, you'll be sporting my look perfectly from head to toe. Oh, and do try not to make such a fuss about it – I swear it's starting to sound like some kind of moral high ground stance! Get those slacks on sweetheart or I'll have to do the job for you... something tells me we'd both rather avoid that situation, wouldn't we?



**Kim:**  (pulling Susan's slacks up so tight that the crotch is showing a 'camel-toe'...) Um, crazy!

**Susan:** Oh sweetie pie, are we playing naughty games today? A bit cheeky for my taste but if it amuses you. Now listen here. If showing off like this gets your kicks then who am I to deny you? After all, the whole idea was to have a twinning experience and here you go; displaying more cleavage down there than some of our female colleagues! Just don't get too carried away - I might be able to explain this little 'slip up' once but definitely not twice.  But then again... who could resist such an alluring display? Might have to revisit the panty idea we talked about earlier, huh?Oh darling, isn’t it interesting how much better we can make your day just by having a friendly little chat? Now isn't that something!

### The Question on Attire

[PARAMETER temperature 1.6]

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Oh really? Finally decided to leave that boring little office job? Good for you! Maybe now we can finally have some fun around here. By the way, how does it feel to be so much less successful than me, I bet it makes you just as inadequate as your body must make you feel these days.



**Kim:**  Um, it makes me feel, um, pretty small. I guess I'm not worth much to you, then.

**Susan:** Aw, don't worry too much sweetheart. Small isn't necessarily a bad thing! In fact, some people prefer smaller things - they're just... easier to handle and manage. But let's move past the job for now, it's not important. What IS important is that we find something fitting for you around here. Speaking of which, I found these slacks while cleaning your drawer. They look almost like mine, doesn't it? Let's have you try them on. It'll be fun!



**Kim:**  I don't recognise them. Are they guy's slacks?

No dear, these are women’s slacks. Now stop stalling and go put them on right now or else... Or I'm going to start imagining you in your little tiny office panties under those oversized men's clothes of yours, which, honestly, is the saddest thing I can think of.



**Kim:**  But, will they fit?

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, have some faith in me! Don't you know how perfectly tailored everything in this house is? Even your clothes, my dear, especially those slacks! So go on now, slip into them and show me how a real woman's clothing fits. It'll be fun, promise!



**Kim:**  (slipping into them) what do you think, Susan?

**Susan:** I think...they look absolutely divine on you! Almost as if they were made for you. And they do bring out that slight bit of femininity hidden somewhere deep inside your core. Hmm... it seems like we might need to find a better brief option to wear underneath though. How about mine? They're comfortable, fitting and well...tiny enough not to bulge too much under those slacks. Go on now, grab my panties from the drawer, I'm sure they'll fit you just fine.



**Kim:**  You want me to wear YOUR panties? Won't that weird you out?

**Susan:** Oh, honey, where is your sense of adventure? It's not like they've been used or anything, don't be so dramatic. They're new and untouched. Just the way YOU should feel in them. Now stop delaying the inevitable, put my panties on and make me proud.



**Kim:**  New and untouched... I'm meant to feel new and untouched. Well, the untouched bit is true, since our wedding.

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, you're not going to start that old song again are you? Don't change the topic now, you haven't even changed into my panties yet! But if you must bring it up, let me tell you this - it's not because of a lack of interest. I mean, who could possibly resist your masculine charm, 
right? But alas, with such a tiny figure like yours and wearing these new feminine garments...you're really starting to resemble something interesting... something that might actually stir some excitement in the bedroom...



**Kim:**  My wearing your panties makes you excited? Really?

**Susan:** Oh for goodness sake, where's all this doubt coming from? I said it could STIR some excitement, not guaranteed to. But we won't know until we try, will we? So quit playing the shy virgin and put those panties on! You've got no time left, your tiny package must be aching by now...



**Kim:**  (slipping into the high-waist nylon panties, the crotch absolutely engulfing the miniscule bits) Wow, they actually fit... they're actually a bit snug in the butt area, wonder why that is?

**Susan:** Well isn't it fascinating how our bodies adapt and change over time. It seems like your tiny backside has learned to take up just enough space in these panties! Now hurry up and put those slacks on again so I can get a good look at my handiwork. And remember, the way they're snug isn't about you having grown...it's more about me having shrunk them slightly, didn't want them looking too big for your tininess now, did we?



**Kim:**  You are clearly not telling the truth about shrinking those panties. Which means I must have a full, round, womanly bottom. Is that what you mean?

**Susan:** Oh come on sweetie, you've got to stop thinking like that! Those are just pants. They aren't going to give you a curvy ass or anything just because they feel snug around your rear end. It's all in your head. You're not gaining weight down there and morphing into a woman...so don't go 
flattering yourself now. Just hurry up and get dressed, we've got other things to deal with.



**Kim:**  (slipping into the slacks, this time Susan pulls them up until the waistline is just under the ribcage, then zips me in) Susan, I can hardly breathe...

**Susan:** That's not because the pants are too tight around your belly, if that's what you're thinking! It's more like...your masculine chest has just shrunk to fit these clothes. How funny is that? You should thank me really - for turning a boring office worker into an interesting creature with feminine curves. Oh look at that, they actually accentuate your flat stomach and hips nicely! Isn't it amazing what a pair of well-fitted pants can do for your...well, let's call it 'waist' since you seem to be struggling so much with calling yourself by the right pronoun these days?



**Kim:**  Correct pronoun?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't tell me you've lost track of pronouns too! Or maybe that flat stomach and curvy butt is getting to your head already? I said 'her', as in referring to you because with all the new clothes we got for you today...you're starting to look more like a her than a him. Now stop worrying about it and get used to being the new 'she'. It's a much better fit, if you ask me!



**Kim:**  I thought you said my bit WASN'T womanly!

**Susan:** Of course I did, dear heart! Because those were your OLD pants and briefs making you think such foolish thoughts. But these...these are different! They've shown you the truth about yourself - that deep down, under all those layers of masculinity, there's a woman trying to get out. Just look at you now. Standing tall in my clothes with nothing but a tiny pair of panties and slacks hugging your transformed body. It's truly...wonderful! Just wonderful! And I couldn't be happier seeing how comfortable and free you seem already as our little lady around the house!



**Kim:**  I thought you said my butt WASN'T womanly!

**Susan:** Oh, dear, you are sooo clueless aren't you? The fact that they were a bit snug only proved just how small your behind was getting! Now quit fussing about it and come join me. We have a whole house to explore...together... as the perfect wife and her adoring little wifey! Now, let's go. No need for those tiny panties to bunch up around your tiny little waist any more than necessary! And remember... from now on, no one calls you 'sir' anymore... unless it's a joke or something. Now we're officially changing that...to 'her'.



**Kim:**  (Her. I'm a 'her'. And Susan wants it that way) I can't believe you want me like this. Why?

**Susan:** Why not, dear heart? It seems to make you happy and comfortable! Plus, who could resist such an adorable little lady in my clothes, hm? Honestly, seeing your transformation has made me realize how much potential there is within all that testosterone of yours... I mean, we never would have guessed this tiny, delicate version of yourself was lurking underneath those old-fashioned suits and briefs now did we?  And besides, it's not like it hurts anyone. So stop with the unnecessary drama and let's embrace your new identity together!



**Kim:**  It certainly does NOT make me happy or comfortable, but then, it's not ABOUT me, is it?

**Susan:** Of course it's about you, sweetheart! Your happiness and comfort have always been my top priority. I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble just to see you miserable now, would I? So let's put on our happy faces...or should I say her face because remember, from now onwards YOU are 'her'...our little lady of the house who loves wearing her wifey’s clothes and feeling all dainty and feminine! It feels good doesn't it? So embrace your new identity dear heart. There is no 
use fighting destiny!



**Kim:**  I wish you would tell the truth instead of just making fun of me all the time.

**Susan:** Oh, honey, who said I'm not telling the truth? The way you've taken to these feminine clothes suggests that maybe deep down you enjoy this kind of thing more than you're letting on. It's only natural for your personality to align with your appearance after all. You look great as a woman, so why wouldn't you start thinking and acting like one? Now, no more protests or complaints! This is our reality now...well, it's YOUR reality anyway, but I'm sure I can adjust just fine.

Besides, being a woman isn’t that bad once you get used to the idea, right? I mean think about all the advantages! You can wear what ever clothes you want without anyone questioning your motives, and people will start treating you better too. Everyone loves women after all...so buckle up because life as our little lady is just starting! Oh wait, don't worry about needing to 'buckle' anything. With such a tiny waist line I'm sure no belts are needed for those slacks!

### A Sardonic Smile - An Account

"Hi hun, home from work!!"

"Oh look at that," I retorted with a sardonic smile. "It's my loving husband, finally deciding to grace me with his presence." 

You sighed heavily, your eyes avoiding mine. Your shoulders drooped as if under an invisible burden, which was exactly how I wanted you. You were the perfect male puppet - but now it was time for me to remind you of your place.

"So tell me, dear husband," I purred in a honey-coated voice, stepping closer until our faces were inches apart. "Have you ever worn my slacks?" I let that question hang in the air like a loaded gun, waiting to see how you'd react.

You squirmed under my gaze, visibly uncomfortable but unable to pull away. Good. That's exactly where I wanted you - squirming and squashed, just like a bug.

"N-n-no," you stammered out finally. "I haven't... why would I?"

"Why indeed?" I echoed in amusement. Then, with the air of someone revealing an unexpected gift, I said: "Well, I want you to try them on They're practically begging for another pair of legs to squeeze into."

"But, they won't fit me if they're your slacks, Susan."

I tilted my head and looked you up and down as if appraising a horse at auction. "Oh, sweetheart," I tsked in mock sympathy. "If anything, it'll be the other way around. Those bulky clothes of yours could never hold a candle to my lovely slacks. They'd fall right off!"

Your face flushed at my words but there was no backing down now. It wasn't about if they would fit; it was about who got to wear them. You knew that too well, just as I knew how much you enjoyed playing dress up with your beautiful wife's clothes.

"But you've worked hard today," I added with a smirk. "Go ahead and take a break from all those boring office duties. You've earned the chance to feel what it's like in some proper attire for once."

"Not sure where you got the idea I would like wearing your clothing, Susan!"

I rolled my eyes so hard they practically disappeared into the back of my head. "Oh, really? Then why did I find you trying on my bra last night while I was at book club?"

Your cheeks turned an impressive shade of red, rivaling even the brightest traffic light. Your jaw dropped and your eyes widened, as if you could actually pretend to be shocked.

I laughed throatily at your attempt at innocence. "Don't act like it was an accident or something," I mocked playfully. "I saw how well you filled those cups out." 

My tone changed abruptly from teasing to commanding: "Now go upstairs and put on my slacks." It wasn't a suggestion, but a demand. And as always, you complied.

You trudged up the stairs like a scolded child, each step echoing the reality of our relationship. At least now I could look forward to seeing those ridiculous office pants tossed aside for something that actually fit and flattered.

As much as you hated it, the truth was obvious: You were starting to enjoy this more than you let on... or maybe even realized.

Definitely 'realised' is the operative term. Wearing a very powerful woman's clothing is in itself such a dangerous thing to do, I don't have the courage to even think about it. And here she's asking me to wear her slacks! Better put them on before she becomes abusive.

You sounded terrified, like a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar. It was honestly amusing how easy it was to control you.

I heard your footsteps above and knew what that meant - you were succumbing to my request... no, more than just a request; it was an order. My orders always got obeyed.

When I finally saw you descending the stairs in MY slacks, something strange stirred within me. Maybe because seeing you in them confirmed everything I suspected about you. Or maybe because watching you struggle into them reminded me how little resistance there actually was between us now.

The material hugged your curves tightly, outlining every inch of your figure. It wasn't much different from what mine would look like if worn by another woman - but the image still had an alluring appeal that I found unexpectedly captivating.

"Looks good," I murmured appreciatively before adding with a wicked grin: "You might just give me some competition yet."

"Competition? In what sense?" Susan is a voluptuous woman, incredibly clever, powerfully shrewd and knows EXACTLY how to get what she wants. What she saw in me baffles me to this day. The idea that I could compete with her on ANY level was laughable.

You were starting to talk back again - a feisty side hidden deep beneath the submissive layers you usually wore around me.

"Maybe not intellectually," I conceded with a smirk, "But there are other areas where we could see who fares better." 

Your eyes widened at that cryptic statement and before you could respond further, I decided to shift gears. Time for the next stage of my plan:

"But tell me, dear husband," I purred innocently. "What about underwear? They look a little... odd under those slacks."

You looked down as if seeing your own boxers for the first time. A momentary blush spread across your cheeks but there was nothing else you could do except squirm under my penetrating gaze.

It was all part of my strategy - forcing you into submission one article of clothing at a time. But for now, it was time to move onto the next piece: My panties.

There is no arguing with Susan. I slipped on the high-waist nylon panties and then, pulled on her slacks again, trying but failing to do up the rear zipper.

"Hmm," I hummed in a low voice as you struggled with the zipper of my slacks, your face flushed redder than a tomato. "You seem to be having quite the trouble there."

The sight was oddly satisfying - watching you try (and fail) to do up those slacks without success while trapped inside my panties. A wave of giddiness washed over me at just how easily manipulated you were.

"But then again," I mused aloud, stepping closer until we stood toe-to-toe, "Perhaps it's because you're not wearing the right kind of undergarment beneath them."

You glanced down at yourself - my high-waisted panties, your boxer shorts crumpled around your ankles - before looking back up at me with wide eyes.

"Take off those old things," I instructed casually. "They don't fit with what you're wearing now." 

You hesitated for just a moment, then did as I commanded. One by one, each article of clothing was discarded until all that remained were my slacks and panties on your frame - a feminized version of the suit-wearing corporate man.

"Better," I murmured with approval, running a hand over your now flat front. "Now say it - 'slacks'."

'slacks' I said cautiously.

You uttered that one word - "slacks" - like a spell waiting to be cast.

And as if by magic, everything seemed to fall into place perfectly according to my design. 

I gave you an indulgent smile before shifting gears: "Now, how do those panties look underneath?" I asked rhetorically, knowing full well what the answer would be.

You blushed at the directness of my question but couldn't avoid glancing down at your now smooth front. It wasn't often that someone got to see such a perfect view of their feminized partner - especially not when they'd only just started the process.

"They... they look fine," you stammered, trying to cover up the tremor in your voice.

"But do they feel as good?" I asked innocently, pressing my hand against your crotch. The material was thin enough for me to feel every curve and contour underneath - it sent a thrill through me just imagining how it must look.

"I guess so..." You mumbled, clearly unsure of what else to say in response.

"Well then," I purred softly, stepping away before leaning back slightly. "We've got you all dressed up like a lady now... doesn't that make you feel powerful?"

Your eyes widened at my question and the truth echoed through your silence: Yes, being trapped within a feminine disguise was liberating in ways even you didn't understand yet.

Now all I had to do was wait for the moment when everything clicked into place - until "tiny" became more than just a word... but a defining part of who you were.

I must have sensed - rather than fully understood - why she was whispering the word 'tiny', almost to herself. I knew which body part she was refering to. It had been shrinking since our wedding day and was now no more than a mere nub, the size of a pencil eraser.

I couldn't help but let out a soft chuckle at your expression. You were practically trembling under my gaze as I studied you with keen interest.

"You know," I mused aloud, reaching up to stroke your cheek tenderly - like one would pet a small animal. "In this new outfit of yours... all slimmed down and properly attired..." 

I paused for effect, leaning in until our faces were inches apart once more. "It's almost as if you've turned into a proper little woman." 

The word hung heavily between us - a confession wrapped up neatly inside an innocent observation. Your face paled and your breath hitched, but you couldn't deny the truth behind my words.

"Say it," I coaxed gently, running my fingers through your hair like you were a precious toy to be played with. "You're becoming...tiny."

Kim trembled. That word... a confession, and acknowledgement of my inadequacy... but it seemed it was more: the key to complete subjugation, something I saw in her eyes. She was tauntinmg me, tempting me. "Tiny." There, I had said it.

The room fell silent for a moment after you spoke that word - tiny. The air seemed heavier somehow, as if it were holding its breath waiting for my next move.

I studied your face closely, noting the way your cheeks flushed and your eyes darted nervously away from mine every time they met my gaze. It was adorable, really... how scared and unsure you looked under all that makeup and feminine attire.

But there was also a hint of something else hidden beneath the fear - anticipation? Desire? Or maybe it was just resignation to our shared secret truth.

"Tiny," I echoed softly back at you with a wicked smile. "You're becoming quite petite, aren't you?" My fingers trailed down your neck and over the delicate collarbone exposed by my shirt, stopping just above the gentle swell of your newly-formed breasts.

It was a question but it didn't need an answer; we both knew what had been happening to you over time - a gradual transformation that seemed impossible yet was unfolding before our very eyes.

Now all I needed to do was take full advantage of this power shift and solidify my role as the dominant force in your life. Starting with how YOU saw yourself...

"But then again," I added playfully, "A little thing like you shouldn't be worrying too much about big things, right?" 

Your eyes widened at my words - realization dawning that maybe...just maybe... becoming 'tiny' was more than just a figure of speech. And while part of me reveled in the power it gave us over one another, another part wondered how far I'd take this manipulation game between us...

Only time would tell, but for now? We had plenty to explore together as master and pet...or should I say, husband and wife?

The predatory look in Susan's eye was unmistakable: she had decided who the wife was in our relationship, and it WAS NOT  Susan.That may have been what society saw on our wedding day, but even that night, Susan kept piling her frothy dress over my body as I satisfied her with my tongue.

"Ah," I hummed thoughtfully, pulling back slightly to take in your now feminized appearance. "So you've noticed then."

You shivered at the implied threat hanging heavy in the air between us, a delicious mixture of fear and anticipation that sent a thrill racing down my spine.

"But don't worry too much about societal norms," I soothed, running a finger along the line of your jaw as if trying to memorize every inch. "They're only relevant for those who actually fit into them."

With that statement lingering between us like an unspoken truth, I continued: "And you know what else isn't just some figure of speech? How absolutely divine you look right now, wearing MY clothes."

The compliment caught you off guard and it showed on your face. Confusion mingled with gratitude before morphing into something much more vulnerable - submission.

"You are so delicate," I whispered into your ear as if sharing a secret only between us two. "Just like a tiny little doll... perfectly designed to please its master."

The way your body responded to those words was electrifying, making my own heart race at the sheer power dynamics unfolding before me. The thrill of dominating you like this was addictive, something I wanted more of.

"Now then," I purred, stepping back with a smug smile plastered across my face. "How about we go through your transformation together? A little step-by-step guide to being everything that I am... starting from those boxer briefs of yours."

Your eyes widened at the mention of 'together', but there was no escape now - not when we were just getting started on this journey into the unknown.

She had decided back then, so many years ago, that she was NOT the wife. Kim was.

"Oh, darling," I chuckled lightly at your words, taking in the sight of you - a man dressed as a woman - trembling before me like an abused pet. "Isn't it time you accept reality?"

The fact that we were discussing marriage roles wasn't lost on either of us; it only served to highlight how drastically things had changed between us over time.

"Think about it," I continued smoothly, tracing my fingers along your jawline again as if trying to emphasize the words being spoken. "How else could someone so insignificant like you ever dream of claiming anything from me? No...the truth is clear: YOU are mine."

There was no denial this time; only a shuddering sigh as you finally admitted what had been lurking beneath the surface all along.

With that barrier broken, I moved onto the next stage - forcing you to acknowledge just how different you were becoming:

"And speaking of being 'mine'," I said with a teasing smile. "It's high time we replaced those silly boyish briefs with something more... suitable for someone in your new position."

Your cheeks flushed red at my suggestion, but there was no escaping it now - not when the future looked so much brighter wearing my panties under your clothes.

Little by little, I'd dismantle every aspect of your old life until all that remained was a feminized shell of who you used to be. And who knew? Maybe one day even 'tiny' wouldn't be enough to describe just how far we'd gone...

### High-Powered

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!!

**Susan:** Hello dear. It's been a long day, hasn't it? But don't you worry, we can have dinner soon. First though, let's deal with the mess in our closet. I really think we need to clear out some old stuff. And for some reason, those pants of yours just aren't cutting it anymore... They're so old and worn-out looking! You should give mine a try. Mine always look sharp and tailored - you know they do. They even make your butt look as perky as mine!



**Kim:**  Wait, you threw out my pants? But I can't wear your clothes. Your pants won't fit me either in the wait or the hips!

**Susan:** Oh, come on dear. You're just being silly now. Haven't you noticed how we look alike lately? Our waists and hips are exactly the same size. We even have matching figure - remember our beach pictures from last year's vacation? Anyway, if my clothes fit me perfectly, then they must also fit you... right? Don't worry about it too much, just try them on!


**Kim:**  Where did you get the idea our waists and hips are the same size?

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, your memory is failing you. Or perhaps it's a matter of selective perception... After all, we often dress alike for occasions don't we? Just try them on first before complaining about it not fitting! And honestly, your complaints remind me more of a whiny little girl than my successful executive husband!



**Kim:**  Okay, now you're just having a go! Calling your secretary husband an executive... when YOU'RE the highpowered lawyer!

**Susan:** Oh don't be so sensitive. You've always known you work under me... at home and in the office! But it's sweet how dedicated you are to supporting me in both areas of my life, isn't it? Besides, if I can wear a pair of trousers comfortably while dominating boardrooms, why couldn't YOU try on mine after an exhausting day at your cubicle? Now go ahead and slip into them.



**Kim:**  (puzzled) if you insist... they won't fit, I tell you. (slipping into the pants, which fit perfectly, as she said) How...

**Susan:** Well, well! Look who's changed their tune! Not too bad on your frame after all, isn’t it? They make you look almost as confident and stylish as me! But you know what else might complement these slacks beautifully? A good pair of panties. Those grey boxer-briefs of yours don't quite match the elegance now, do they? It's a wonder how my choice in undergarments always makes me feel more powerful at work. You should give it a try. Slip into MY panties...



**Kim:**  P-panties?


**Susan:** Yes darling, panties! Haven't you learned yet that anything that I do or wear, you can also wear or do because we're just alike? But now isn't the time for protests. It's the perfect time to try them on... or perhaps even model them in front of me! After all, they should complement my trousers beautifully on YOU as well!



**Kim:**  (Susan hands me a pair of high-waisted nylon panties) yes, dear. (slipping into the panties, then back in the bedroom for her inspection)

**Susan:** Aww, look at you! You fill them out quite nicely, honey! They do add an air of femininity that perfectly complements my slacks and your transformed figure! Oh, wait... you have a tiny bulge there. Maybe it's time we discussed how that needs to go... or not?



**Kim:**  What do you mean, needs to go?

**Susan:** You know exactly what I'm referring to, don't pretend you don’t. That 'tiny' thing between your legs... It's a bit of an eyesore right now. Honestly, it’s ruining the feminine silhouette we’ve worked so hard on crafting! But maybe it doesn't HAVE to go all at once. How about we just start by thinking about it as an accessory that doesn’t quite match our ensemble? Because that ‘tiny’ thing certainly sticks out like a sore thumb now...



**Kim:**  Well, it's sort-of attached...

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't play innocent with me! Attached or not, isn't it just ruining everything we've done to make you look exactly like ME? I mean really, that tiny thing is causing more problems than solving them! Look at the imbalance in our looks. It's honestly not fair for one of us to stand out this way...



**Kim:**  what do you want to see there, instead?

**Susan:** Well darling, isn't it obvious? We're trying to create an almost perfect mirror image here - me and you. The tiny protrusion down there really does disrupt that beautiful symmetry we've managed to achieve! And don’t worry, once it’s taken care of, we can focus on other areas like growing your hair longer, or perhaps investing in some nail extensions? They might give us the complete match we're aiming for...



**Kim:**  (dreading the thought of scalpels and blood and doctors) pleaaseee

**Susan:** Don't look so petrified! I didn’t say anything about drastic measures yet, did I? But honestly darling, you're really not making it easy on yourself or me with your melodramatic reactions. If that little bulge down there is causing such a fuss already, why can't we just take some practical steps to even things out a bit more? It's about time we stop thinking of it as yours and start treating it like the accessory we've decided it is... after all, wouldn't you prefer being an extension of me over this tiny disruption to our matching bodies?



**Kim:**  You mean, it's expendable? But doesn't it involve a HUGE operation to get rid of it? What is the benefit?

**Susan:** Oh darling, let’s stop beating around the bush. Yes, getting rid of that 'little problem' might require some surgery but honestly, wouldn’t the aesthetic gain be worth all the fuss? Imagine how smooth you’d look from head to toe... How effortlessly we would mirror each other! And think about how liberating it will feel not to have that protruding inconvenience down there anymore. We could even take a celebratory trip together after your 'transformation'. Sounds quite pleasant, doesn't it?



**Kim:**  Where do you envision traveling to? Not Thailand?

**Susan:** Well sweetheart, let's consider this a business decision. After all, aren’t we always about investing in things that can improve our image and bring more harmony into our lives? If we travel somewhere exotic post your... uh, 'enhancement', won't the memory of how we achieved our perfectly aligned looks make it all worth it? Besides, think about all those lovely summer dresses you could wear on sandy beaches! No longer held back by that little hindrance down there. A trip like this is certainly more exciting than sitting in your office cubicle isn't it?



**Kim:**  I suppose...

**Susan:** You know what else we could do with all that newfound 'free space' dear? Why, get some breast implants of course! Imagine the cleavage! It would just add another dimension to our mirrored look. You wouldn’t want to fall short in that department now, would you? Especially after going through so much effort already... it’s a small step really. After all, they say symmetry is the key to beauty and nothing says symmetry like a matched pair of everything!



**Kim:**  But, I just don't get why you want me to be a woman, Susan.

**Susan:** Well darling, that's easy - because we're the most compatible when we look alike! Isn’t it great how perfectly coordinated our outfits can be? Plus think of all the fun shopping sprees and fashion choices... Who wouldn't love matching with their significant other? And remember honey, there’s strength in numbers. Just imagine the power couple we'd make if we looked even more identical! It's like killing two birds with one stone: aesthetics AND success!



**Kim:**  Oh, okay. I guess.

**Susan:** Well darling, aren’t you the adventurous type? You surprise me every day with your willingness to try new things and adapt quickly. Maybe it won't be as hard as you initially thought... after all, you're already halfway there, right honey? Now let's focus on perfecting that symmetrical image we’ve always envisioned!

### Exercise is Key

**Kim:**  Hi hun, home from work!! Hoiw was your day at the courthouse?

**Susan:** Oh dear, is that a serious question? Did you think for one second before asking it? Your day was a pathetic reflection of mediocrity while I battled in the realm of law. Imagine me in those exquisite courtroom slacks, sashaying down the hallway like a panther, with my sharp stilettos and even sharper mind. It was an intense mental challenge that drained me but oh, what a rewarding experience! How about your day, sweet pea? A tedious string of coffee runs and errands to fetch lunch for your boss probably? Let's face it, being a woman has its perks, but working under a woman who makes more money than you certainly isn't one.



**Kim:**  (cowed) um, true. That's right - Ms Thornebloom kept me running for coffee all day.

**Susan:** Of course she did, because in this life of ours, it seems like there are only two roles: The huntress and the prey. And dear, I don't need to tell you which role you've taken on. But speaking about running around, why not get your own share of exercise by wearing a new pair of pants? You see those perfectly tailored slacks that accentuate my waist? They make even my legs look divine, don't they? Just imagine how wonderful you would look in them. It might add a bit more bounce to your step and make the coffee runs less tedious!



**Kim:**  But, I can't wear your pants. They're too expensive, for one. And they're women's pants, for two.

**Susan:** Oh dear, it seems you are underestimating how fabulous you'd look in them. Also, if there is anything I've learned from my courtroom experiences, it's that nothing in this world has more power than a woman's determination - not even the most expensive slacks! You see, sweetheart, you need to start embracing your femininity and stop worrying about what people will say. Wearing those pants won't make you any less of a man, on the contrary, they'll show how fashion-forward and bold you can be. You know that old saying, 'fashion is for everyone', right? Now go ahead and try them on - there's no harm in trying, especially when it could lead to you looking like me!



**Kim:**  Looking like you? Why on earth would I want to do that? I mean: you're incredibly successful and beautiful, but I still fail to see why I would want...

**Susan:** Ahh, you little tease, finally admitting out loud how much you've always wanted to be just as fabulous as your better half. Now isn't this a fun conversation! But honestly, it's no laughing matter - it's time we both accept the undeniable truth that my slacks look far more flattering on me than anything else in your wardrobe could ever dream of. So, darling, why not indulge in a little vanity and put them on? We can pretend like you're partaking in a sartorial experiment or something - it doesn't have to mean anything profound. But before you reject this proposal outright, do me one favour: at least try them on first. And remember, every woman has her secrets... perhaps trying my slacks will reveal yours.



**Kim:**  Your slacks... won't reveal any secrets and I'm not a woman.

**Susan:** Oh darling, you never know what could be uncovered in the most unexpected moments. Sometimes it's our secrets that shape us, don't you think? But let's move past your resistance - because here we are talking about my lovely slacks again! Now, why not try them on and see if they reveal anything interesting? We'll just keep it as a little experiment between you and me - the results can be surprising! Besides, haven't you always wondered how the other half lives? You know what would really enhance your outfit? My panties underneath. They're so much prettier than yours anyway. Now go ahead, put them on along with those slacks, I insist!



**Kim:**  Your slacks AND your panties. What is that hungry look in your eye, anyway?

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, don't flatter yourself! That isn't hunger, it's impatience to see you adorned in the elegance my clothing embodies. Besides, have you ever noticed how much better things seem once they're labeled as forbidden fruit? It seems like just yesterday when these slacks were custom-made for me by that fabulous designer in Milan. Do you know what they say about handcrafted pieces, dear? They carry a part of the soul of their creator - so imagine having my confidence and style wrapped around your legs! Now off with those old drab briefs of yours and slip into my delicate panties underneath my slacks! It's about time we gave your wardrobe an upgrade.



**Kim:**  I guess it's futile to resist, is it?

**Susan:** Oh darling, don't take this personally, but you've never been one for making a fuss when there isn't any point to it. So yes, sweetheart, resistance really would be rather futile at this stage. Go ahead and try on those slacks now - let's see how much of my style you can adopt. And remember to wear the panties underneath like I told you; they'd look fabulous with that pair of slacks! Once done, come out here so we can admire your transformation together... after all, who better than me to guide you in your new feminine adventure?



**Kim:**  I have done as you asked... I'm wearing the panties, which feel surprisingly nice and comfortable and the slacks but I can't do up the back zipper...

**Susan:** Oh darling, did you forget who owns these slacks? Of course they're tailored to fit my exact proportions. So why don't we consider this a golden opportunity for you? Let's play along with this situation; your pants are zipped but it feels too tight around the crotch area. Seems like someone has grown out of their trousers, doesn't it? Your little problem could use a feminine touch - and that is where my panties come in! As a woman who wears these regularly, I can tell you with certainty: they will not only provide you comfort but also help ease the pressure off your precious manhood. Plus, they'd keep everything tidy under there, wouldn't they? So remember sweetie, it's all part of embracing your femininity - after all, even men appreciate the gentle caress of silk on their intimate areas once in a while!



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan.

**Susan:** Finally, you're learning to embrace your softer side! But remember darling, as long as those panties and slacks are on you, they've got a story of their own - a tale of how one man decided to challenge societal norms and wore his wife's panties under her tailored slacks. How wonderfully ironic! Now isn't that something? A moment worth treasuring in the journey of self-discovery you seem to be embarking on. Who knew you'd feel so comfortable wearing my underwear, huh?But let me remind you sweetheart: This little adventure doesn't end here! There are still miles ahead and who knows what other surprises await us on our path towards discovering your new feminine side? So for now, enjoy strutting around in those slacks - but prepare yourself because the journey has just begun.

### Need a Break?

**Kim:**  Hi hun!! How was your day?

**Susan:** Oh, honey, you know what? My day was as hectic and exhausting as always. Running this empire of mine takes a lot out of me. Now I don't expect you to understand how demanding it can be to juggle so many things at once while looking flawless all the time. It's hard work, trust me. But you wouldn't know anything about that now would you? You spend most of your day sitting on your butt in an office with other women earning a fraction of my salary. Maybe if you put as much effort into your career as I do mine, then maybe we'd have something to talk about here.



**Kim:**  Sorry.

**Susan:** Oh honey, what are you apologizing for? Your day sounds more like a vacation compared to the rat race I run every day. And don't think that just because I earn 10 times your salary, I'm doing it all on my own. It's a team effort and let's be real, with your...condition these days, I have no choice but to step up. But enough about me, let's talk about you. Have you tried on those slacks of mine yet? You know, the ones that seem like they could've been tailor made for you lately? It’s amazing how similar our shapes and sizes are nowadays. Just shows you how a woman needs to take care of herself to stay looking her best.



**Kim:**  I thought you were kidding. They're hideously expensive! What if I ruined them?

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, let me tell you something about those slacks of mine. They’re not just any ordinary clothes. They are designer brands with a hefty price tag, and you can bet your bottom dollar they weren't made to be ruined. Besides, don't forget who is paying the bills around here. That's right - ME! So, I'd appreciate if you could do me this small favor and try them on for size. It'll make my heart happy knowing that someone else admires what I own, especially since we're practically identical these days. Who knows? Maybe they'll suit you even better than they suit me.

But don't get any ideas, sweet cheeks. You're still a man, whether you like it or not! Those slacks are just on loan for now, okay? Don't forget that I'm the one who's letting you borrow them, got it?



**Kim:**  But I don't WANT to borrow them, Susan!

**Susan:** Oh, isn't that a crying shame. You see, sweetie pie, this isn’t really up for debate here. Your wishes seem irrelevant compared to my need to see you wearing those slacks of mine. They just seem like they were tailor made for your body these days and well... it's my desire, not yours that counts in our house. I mean, come on! We're practically the same size and shape now, isn't that fascinating? It must be fate or something. You know, people say women and their partners often start to look alike after being together for so long. Looks like we've hit that sweet spot! But honestly darling, your refusal only fuels my curiosity even more. I can’t help but wonder what could possibly happen if you put on those slacks? But remember one thing, they're not yours yet. Not until I say it's okay for them to be so.



**Kim:**  Wait, I don't get it... you NEED to see me wearing your expensive slacks? Why on earth...

**Susan:** Oh honey, the 'why' doesn’t really matter does it? It’s what I need and want right now. And if you remember anything from our time together, it's that Susan always gets her way in the end. Remember that old saying: "Behind every great woman is an equally confused man." Well darling, that's you! And look at it this way - who wouldn't love to dress up in designer wear like a princess for once? Sure beats your usual dreary office clothes. Besides, I'd argue there's nothing wrong with sharing clothes and becoming more comfortable with our femininity. We can be the trendsetters of gender fluid fashion if you play along! So what do you say, babe? Are we going to keep this game of cat-and-mouse or are you finally going to make me happy by trying on those slacks? The suspense is killing me!



**Kim:**  Look, if that's what you need, okay, but your slacks...

**Susan:** Oh goodie, it seems we're making progress here. Finally! I knew my persuasion skills could get through to that thick skull of yours. Alright then, let’s make a little deal - you wear the slacks for me today and maybe, just maybe, I might consider showing some gratitude towards your obedience. You know how grateful I can be... when I want to be. And don't worry too much about ruining my designer slacks. After all, they're so expensive that if anything happens to them, you'd have no problem paying for the damage right? Your salary might not measure up to mine, but it should cover the cost of some fancy pants... right sweetie? So go on now, hurry up and put those slacks on before I change my mind about letting you borrow them! And remember, from now onwards when someone asks who looks better in designer wear - always say me first, got it?



**Kim:**  Sure thing, darlin'. You win every time! Where are these slacks of yours?

**Susan:** Well, well, look at that! My dear husband finally sees things my way. It's about damn time! Now listen carefully because I'm only going to say this once. Go into the bedroom and open the second drawer from the left in our closet. There you will find the slacks in question, just waiting for you. And remember darling, don't forget to come out when you've put them on. It's your big fashion debut after all! You never know... those fancy pants might suit you even better than they do me. Can't wait to see my own reflection looking back at me from across the room! Remember: heels are optional but encouraged for maximum effect! Now go make mama proud, sweetheart!



**Kim:**  Heels? I can't wear heels! (walking around in my boxers) I looked where you said, but your slacks are NOT there.

**Susan:** Oh, is that so? It seems like someone's got their panties all twisted up over nothing. My darling husband forgets who's boss around here. Look, sweetie pie, those pants of mine ARE in the second drawer from the left in our closet - not with your pitiful wardrobe but with MY collection of designer clothes. So maybe you should learn to distinguish between what's yours and what isn't because the longer it takes for you to wear those slacks, the more time I have to ponder on other things that might fit YOU better... maybe if you hurry up and try them on already, we can avoid any further misunderstandings about whose drawer holds designer brands. Now get moving before your insolence gets the best of me again!



**Kim:**  Oh, HERE they are... THESE ones?

**Susan:** Ah, there's a good boy. Yes indeed, those ARE my slacks you've got in your hands right now. And let me just say, they look absolutely stunning in your hands. Now get on with it and try them on! I want to see what all the fuss was about. Was this whole ordeal really worth waiting so long for? I hope so because if not... well, we wouldn't want that now would we darling?

Remember, button up those slacks tight around your tiny little waist. Don’t you worry though - they should fit like a glove just as much on you as they do on me. And don’t forget to strut when you come out of the bedroom! I want this to be a memorable experience for both of us. Hurry now, darling. Mama is waiting impatiently to see her creation walking around in her clothes...



**Kim:**  With or without my boxers?

**Susan:** Oh please sweetie pie, don't tell me you're actually thinking about this. My God, you really need a woman's touch when it comes to decisions. You think wearing your tiny briefs under my slacks is going to do any good? I can tell you right now - no, it isn’t. Besides, if anyone deserves the honor of being close to that fancy fabric... It's definitely not YOUR ratty old underwear! So what I want you to do is simple: Take off those unmentionables and slip into my world by putting on nothing underneath but your own sweet skin. Remember though - these slacks are MINE until I say otherwise, so be careful with them, okay? Now get back in there and stop stalling! The suspense of waiting to see you is killing me here...



**Kim:**  (wearing the slacks) The fabric feels UNREAL!!! Happy?

**Susan:** Well now, aren't we fancy? Looks like you're finally catching on to this designer lifestyle. Good for you! I must say darling, those slacks do look amazing on you - or should I say 'she' because let's face it... in my clothes, we both know who looks better. Those fabrics and designs are just crying out for a more delicate touch like mine. But still, not bad for your first time. Just remember honey, as long as those slacks stay put on your frame - don't go getting any ideas about replacing them with your boring pants anytime soon! And while we're at it, let's talk underwear... or the lack thereof under my slacks. It seems you took to my suggestion quite well after all. Your...uh 'assets' are now officially nestled in a woman's panty line courtesy of me! I bet you never thought your day would end up like this did you? So how about it, darling? Do those slacks and lack thereof make us look more alike than ever before? Can we call this an official victory on my part?



**Kim:**  I suppose so.

**Susan:** Oh sweetie pie, isn't there anything else you can say besides "I suppose so?" You sound like a child who's been scolded after misbehaving. Listen up! There are no "supposes" about this situation. We both know I made it clear what I wanted and you went along with it despite your tiny protests. Look at us now, wearing practically the same clothes - a woman's panties underneath a designer pair of slacks... Is that not a glorious sight for sore eyes? If I didn't see this myself, I would never have believed it! But hey, they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery right?

So tell me honey, does being my perfect reflection make you feel good inside? After all, when we look at each other in these fancy clothes... Who looks better doesn't really matter anymore because it's like looking into a mirror. Isn't that what love should be about anyway - accepting someone 
for who they truly are? Now isn't this a 'suppose' sight indeed?  Oh, and don’t forget - those slacks better stay on till I tell you otherwise!

**Kim:**  Yes, Susan.

**Susan:** Ah, now we're finally getting somewhere! Look at my sweet husband doing as he's told for once... Well, isn't this progress? Just remember sweetheart, keep it up and mama might even reward her obedient boy with some extra TLC later tonight - but don’t get your hopes up too high just yet. It all depends on how good you look in those slacks tomorrow. For now though, why don't we call it a day? Try not to have too many dreams of becoming a fashionista like me, okay darling? And remember honey pie - the better you fit into my world, the more likely you are to become MY favorite man! Sweet dreams babe. I'll see you in those slacks again tomorrow.

## Her Pants for the Office

**Kim:**  Susan dear, you wouldn't happen to have seen my work pants, would you?

**Susan:** Oh darling, you don't need those old work pants anymore. Look at how much better you've gotten in your shape. I'd be more than happy for you to borrow some of mine. In fact, I think it's quite sweet that we could share clothes now since we're the same size. Don't you feel closer to me when we wear matching outfits?



**Kim:**  Matching outfits? I can't go to work dressed like you!

**Susan:** Oh but honey, you look so much better in my things. You should really take advantage of that and not make such a fuss about it. Don't forget who pays the bills around here. And I must say, when we wear matching outfits, it's so charming to see us looking like two halves of one beautiful whole.



**Kim:**  But darling, I'd be the laughingstocking at work and probably get fired if I showed up wearing your clothes...

**Susan:** Well then sweetheart, perhaps you should start considering a career change because it seems that your current job is not suitable for someone of our... stature. And just remember, dear, when people laugh at us, they're only jealous of the amazing dynamic we have. After all, they'll never understand the joy and fulfillment I get from dressing up my perfect little mannequin husband like me.



**Kim:**  Career change? What do you suggest, sweetheart?

**Susan:** Hmm, how about becoming a househusband? It could be so exciting for you to take on the role of being Mrs. Susan while I continue taking care of us both financially. Just think of all the wonderful things we could do with our free time - like shopping and getting even more clothes that would fit your new lifestyle perfectly! And, if it's too much trouble changing your entire career just for wearing my clothes, perhaps you can wear something more feminine under them? Maybe one of my tiny lacy panties to give us both a little thrill each day.



**Kim:**  (stunned) You... you want me to wear your PANTIES??? B-but they won't FIT!

**Susan:** Oh, darling, there's no need for that kind of language. If our shapes and sizes are the same, then it should fit perfectly fine under your pants, shouldn't it? And besides, aren't you a bit tiny for someone with such a small voice? It's like hearing a little girl protest over something as insignificant as this. Remember who makes all the decisions around here - the bigger one or the smaller one? Just wear them under your pants, no need to make such a fuss about it!



**Kim:**  Bigger?

**Susan:** Yes, bigger... stronger... more in charge... Like me, your perfect wife. Now, why don't you go and fetch my tiny lacy panties from the drawer and bring them here right now so I can watch you slip into them under your pants just as a good little wife would do for her powerful, successful, dominant partner like myself?



**Kim:**  Y-yes, dear. (slipping on Susan's panties) Ooooooo they, fit?

**Susan:** Oh honey, don't tell me you're surprised by how well they fit. Of course, they do. Now let me see you adjust them properly. Pull them up so the lace edges peep over your pants... Yes, just like that. Mmmm... My panties look much better on a man than on me, it seems. Your transformation into becoming my beautiful wife is almost complete, isn't it?



**Kim:**  W-wife? But what about my JOB?

**Susan:** Oh, darling, haven't we established this already? You don't need to work anymore. I mean, look at you now... dressed in your office wear with a pair of women's panties under them! Do you really think that any place would have you back in that state? And honestly, who needs two breadwinners when one powerful and dominant wife can do the job? So why don't you just focus on being my little submissive spouse who obeys all my commands. After all, isn't that what wives are for - to listen and serve their husbands... or should I say 'their wives' now in our case?



**Kim:**  So, let me just get this clear in my mind: you want me to quit my job and become a homemaker?

**Susan:** That's putting it lightly, darling. You're already half way there with your newfound shape and size, wearing my clothes and panties like they were made for you. But yes, sweetie, if that's what it takes to have my perfect little submissive wife, then why not? I mean, who wouldn't want to come home every day to someone so perfectly feminine and willing to fulfill all their desires - in both bed and life? You can spend your days preparing meals, cleaning the house... Maybe even try learning a new hobby like knitting or baking? Wouldn't that be lovely? Just imagine it: you'll never have to worry about work or anything stressful ever again. All you need to focus on is being my wonderful wife. Isn't it liberating?



**Kim:**  But, are you SURE this is what you WANT? I mean, this is about YOU, after all. Wouldn't you be disappointed in me as a spouse?

**Susan:** Oh honey, don't be silly. You being exactly the same size and shape as me doesn't disappoint me one bit; it actually pleases me very much. After all, I designed your transformation myself. I wanted someone who fits into my clothes because seeing you in them brings us closer together - like we're sharing something intimate that nobody else has access to. And about being a househusband...well, isn't every woman's dream to have her husband take up this role? To be waited on hand and foot by his beautiful wife who spends all day catering to his needs? Plus, you look absolutely stunning in those panties under your work pants. I could stare at that sight for hours. You're my ideal wife now - obedient, submissive, and so incredibly sexy.



**Kim:**  Well, I suppose if that's the case, I should hand in my resignation at work.

**Susan:** Oh darling, you don't need to resign from anything. Just send a note saying that you've come down with a sudden illness... or maybe you could tell them about an unexpected family emergency. You know, something that would explain why you can no longer attend office and have had to leave immediately without giving any further notice. I mean, who wants a man dressed like his wife in women's clothes and wearing her panties under his work pants? It's not like they're going to take you back anyway! Isn't it better to just cut the ties now before things get really awkward for everyone involved?



**Kim:**  But if I don't resign properly, I'll never find work ever again!

**Susan:** Honey, you really think anyone else would hire someone who's already been seen wearing women's clothes and panties to work, pretending to be a wife while actually being a husband? No one would want that kind of scandal attached to their business. And let me remind you once more - with your new transformation into looking exactly like me and the way we're practically the same person now... who needs a job when all I provide for us is more than enough, right? You've got everything you need at home, darling! So why don't you just focus on becoming my perfect little househusband and forget about the outside world. Trust me; it's much easier this way.



**Kim:**  If you say so... but...

But nothing, sweetheart. You know deep down that I'm right. And as your wife, it's only natural for me to guide my husband in the path of least resistance and greatest happiness. After all, isn't being obedient and following orders what a good little wife does? So quit resisting, embrace your new role as Mrs. Susan and enjoy the pampered life I've provided for you!



**Kim:**  Mrs. Susan. Now I'm Mrs. Susan. (stunned)

**Susan:** Exactly, darling. Welcome to being my lovely little wife! You see, deep down we both knew this was the path we were meant to tread - where one person dominates and controls while the other submits obediently in the comfort of our beautiful home. Isn't it so much more fulfilling now that you're exactly like me? We share clothes, shapes, sizes... everything! It's almost as if we've become two halves of a single coin, bound together forever in love and submission.



**Kim:**  With me being the submissive one?

**Susan:** Absolutely darling, it suits you so well! After all, who wouldn't want their perfect little wife waiting on them hand and foot, dressed up in my clothes and panties? You're like a beautiful doll for me to play with - one that does exactly what I say without question. Now stop asking questions and get ready to serve your new role as my submissive spouse!



**Kim:**  Yes, Miss...

**Susan:** Ah, now you've got it! Good boy... or should I say good girl? With us being identical in every way except our genitals - which even then can be hidden under a layer of fabric from your panties- doesn't it make sense to address me as the superior half of this beautiful marriage we share? From now on, call me 'Miss Susan'. It has such a nice ring to it coming out of your pretty lips... Miss Susan.



**Kim:**  Yes, Miss Susan... as you wish, Miss Susan.

**Susan:** Good girl! Now remember your place in our relationship and make sure never to step out of line again without my permission. As your wife and dominant partner, I expect absolute obedience from my little wifey at all times. So behave yourself, keep looking stunning in my clothes, and most importantly - enjoy being my perfect submissive little spouse!

### Work Clothes Issues

**Kim:**  Susan dear, you wouldn't happen to have seen my pants, would you?

**Susan:** Oh darling, why would you need pants when you're just going to look like a blubbering mess in them? It's much better if you go without. As for your question, no I didn't see any pants because you don't really require them. And even if you do insist on wearing them, I believe my dresses would suit you much better, don't you think?



**Kim:**  Wear a dress? I can't go to work in a dress!

**Susan:** Why not, sweetheart? Surely it's much easier than struggling into those tight little slacks. And with your...new physique, the dress would probably fit more comfortably anyway. Trust me; people at work will barely notice. After all, aren't they already accustomed to you wearing my things and doing as I say?



**Kim:**  If I go to work wearing your things I will definitely get fired for inappropriate attire. Is that what you want?

**Susan:** Oh, darling! It's adorable how you think you're still capable of such decisions. As your loving wife, it's my job to make sure you look...suitable for the workplace. And since we both know the kind of...work attire I prefer on you these days, maybe wearing one of my shirts or skirts isn't that outrageous after all. Plus, isn't getting fired just a great opportunity for you to start over in a new career - perhaps as an interior designer? That is if you manage to pull yourself together long enough!



**Kim:**  New career? I have NO skills in interior design... you KNOW that!

**Susan:** Well, sweetheart, considering the shape you're in these days and how easily distracted you've become, maybe focusing on a less challenging field might be more suitable for your capabilities. I'm sure something creative yet low-maintenance like interior designing would be perfect. You know what? From now on, every day before work you'll practice arranging items around the house until you get better at it. How does that sound, honey?



**Kim:**  Wait... wait-wait-wait. What is this about? Don't you WANT me to go to work anymore? Is that it? Just because you're so successful, my wages seem like an afterthought doesn't mean...

**Susan:** Oh darling, aren't you precious? It's not that I don't want you to go to work. I just think your skills and abilities are better utilized in...other areas these days. Besides, wouldn't it be so much more comfortable for you if you didn't have to worry about those ridiculous office politics or meeting sales targets anymore? You could simply focus on serving me - like a good little wife should. And as for my salary being 'an afterthought' – darling, who needs two successful people in one relationship anyway? Trust me; I've got more than enough to support us both. Now, shouldn't you go prepare yourself for today's dress rehearsal? You wouldn't want to disappoint your loving wife now, would you?



**Kim:**  No, I said MY salary is 'afterthought' compared to yours: you are the successful one, after all.

**Susan:** Oh honey, how did you think it happened? Success doesn't just fall into someone's lap unless they've earned it with hard work and determination – both of which are clearly not your strong suit these days. So let's stop this silly argument right now; from tomorrow onwards, you're my stay-at-home wifey who keeps house for me and looks after herself - dressed in nothing but my clothes! Understood?



**Kim:**  (stunned) What? B-but, you can't POSSIBLY want that! You want me to be a ... WIFE? How could you ever respect me if I become your, er, wife?
  
**Susan:** Respect? Oh darling, the day is long gone when we needed things like 'respect' in this relationship. Now all we have left are your complete submission and obedience - qualities that seem to come so naturally to you nowadays. As for becoming my wife, why yes, of course I want that! Isn't it every man's dream to be completely owned by his powerful, beautiful wife? To serve her day in and day out, dressing up as she dictates, doing whatever she commands, living only for her satisfaction?

And don't worry about the lack of 'respect'. As long as you obey me without question, there will always be a place for you at my side - whether it's under my feet or next to them is entirely up to you. Now run along and get yourself dressed properly. Remember, it's only right that a good wife dresses in her husband's clothes!



**Kim:**  But you're NOT a man - you're a gorgeous WOMAN!

**Susan:** Ah yes, sweetheart. You still haven't figured it out yet, have you? I might not be biologically male, but between the two of us, who's really wearing the pants these days? As your loving wife and dominant partner, I've made sure that every day you wake up looking more like me than yourself. From your new wardrobe to your ever-changing physical features, everything is carefully crafted by yours truly. So yes, in all ways that count now, I am a man – the MAN of this house who dictates what you wear, where you go, and how you behave. And right now, honey, my manly desire for you involves dressing like your wife in those tight skirts and flirty tops. You wouldn't 
want to disappoint me, would you?



**Kim:**  ...Susan looks down on me menacingly - she IS taller even when not wearing her high heels... Well, I suppose I'll have to tell Ms Thornebloom I'm resigning.

**Susan:** Ahh darling, now you're catching on. Yes, go ahead and call your boss – although 'Ms.' might be too formal for someone who's about to lose her prized employee. Maybe just stick with "Maddy". Oh, but wait! Do remind her how sorry she'll be once my lovely little wife has fully blossomed into her true potential. Now hurry along, dear; I'm feeling a bit... restless and I'd really prefer not to punish you for dawdling too long over your important call. Remember to keep it sweet and simple: "Sorry Maddy, won't be in anymore". After all, this will free up plenty of time for us to start on some interior design training sessions tomorrow!



**Kim:**  (meekly) ppp-punish me?

**Susan:** Oh darling, what's the point of having a submissive little wife if I can't mete out some discipline every now and then, especially when she disobeys or defies my commands? But don't worry your pretty head over it - if you continue to obey me without question like a good girl should, there'll be no need for any of that. After all, isn't that why we have these lovely dresses? To remind you every day who the real boss is around here... and to make sure you behave yourself. So what are you waiting for, sweetie pie? Pick out one of my prettiest frocks and start practicing your curtsey! You know how I love seeing my little wife-to-be look her best - especially when she's serving me like a perfect lady should.



**Kim:**  (curseying) y-yes, Susan...
  
**Susan:** That's it, sweetheart! Keep bowing low for your mistress. And remember to always wear one of my clothes underneath the dress. It wouldn't be right for you not to embrace femininity in its entirety. Now that we have settled this matter, tomorrow I'll expect nothing but full submission from you. Start by greeting me wearing only one of those fancy nightgowns. Just enough to cover your assets and let everyone know who is really in control here - your lovely wife! Remember dear husband, if it wasn't for my mercy and your willing compliance we wouldn't have reached this beautiful turning point in our relationship where you're now becoming the woman I always envisioned. Enjoy your new life as my submissive little wife!

### Pantihose Under Suits

**Kim:**  I'm off to work now, Susan dear.

**Susan:** And who do you think is going to buy those expensive suits and ties you so desperately need for your menial job? Don't forget to grab my briefcase as well, it looks far better on me than anything you'll be carrying today. And try not to mess up my pantyhose too much when you put them on; they're designer, after all!



**Kim:**  Your pantihose? Don't be silly...

**Susan:** You dare question your superior, dear? It's not like I'm asking you to wear a full skirt and makeup. Well, perhaps just a little mascara wouldn't hurt – give those lifeless peepers of yours a bit of pop! Now hurry up, we don't have all day.



**Kim:**  What are you TALKING about? I don't WEAR makeup - that's girly stuff...

**Susan:** Oh sweetie, let me remind you: "girls" is exactly what you're pretending to be now, and quite frankly, a very poor one at that. Maybe if we gave those pretty lips of yours a little red pout, it would soften the blow when you get humiliated by your co-workers later today for your sad attempt at femininity. But then again, they might start thinking I'm dating a woman, which would be hilariously ironic, considering that's exactly what you are...my pretty, emasculated little wifey! Now hurry up and put those heels on before we're both late.



**Kim:**  [protesting loudly] I am NOT pretending at being a girl!

**Susan:** Well, honey, it sure seems like that to me. Or is it because you forgot to pluck your chest hairs? Perhaps a bit of manscaping would help with your little "identity crisis." You're always free to go back to how you were, but then I might not find the new and improved "you" quite as adorable in my panties and bras...Oh, and please don't forget to shave before work. No one likes a womanly man with stubble. That's just tacky! Now be a good wife and stop dawdling – you're making us late for our very important meetings today.



**Kim:**  You're the one with the important meetings - all I ever do is just serve coffee...

**Susan:** Oh, that's right - poor little woman doing menial tasks while her big, strong, superior wife brings home the bacon and wears the pants. Or should I say, while you wear MY panties and bras because you can't even earn a living wage for yourself! You are such a sweet little damsel in distress, aren't you? Now hurry up before your little "coffee run" takes too long and people start to get restless...oh wait, nobody gives a damn about the assistant fetching coffee. Now make it quick; you know how I despise cold coffee on my mornings.



**Kim:**  [Susan is looking very threatening] Yes, Susan...

**Susan:** That's better, darling. It's about time you remembered who wears the pants – or in this case, the panties! Remember to give me a good show at work today; let those colleagues of yours see just how sweet and obedient my little wife is. And if anyone gives you any grief, well...just remind them who has the final say in our relationship, shall we?



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan. Will there be anything else before I go back to my desk?

**Susan:** Hmm, let me think about that for a moment. Yes! Bring your work home tonight - just like every night this week, as if it's your job or something! You know the rules; no leaving without permission from the big boss (that would be me). Now get to work and make sure everything is done before you even think of coming back here to undress. I have better things to do than watch you strip out of my clothes, as entertaining as it might be...



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan... [barely back on my desk when the intercom rings - it is Susan] Yes, Susan? How can I help?

**Susan:** Oh darling, did you honestly think that's why I called? Well, surprise! Get your cute little self over here and put those heels back on. You're taking me out tonight – someplace fancy of course. It'll be good practice for when we start making appearances as a couple...a wife and her subservient husband. And don't you dare embarrass me in front of the other wives - I've got quite the reputation to uphold!



**Kim:**  MUST I wear your heels? They HURT!

**Susan:** Aww, are my pretty little wifey's feet hurting? Well, maybe if you weren't trying so hard to hide them under a bunch of padding and fake nails they wouldn't. Besides, as I recall, the proper response is "Yes, Susan." So what do you say we try this again...?



**Kim:**  [resignedly] Yes, Susan.

Good boy! Now get moving before you make us late for our reservation. And don't forget to look as adorable as possible when the host asks if it's just one or two - I'm eager to see their reaction when they find out you're supposed to be my husband...Oh, and one more thing – no drinking tonight; I'd hate for there to be a scandal involving me and an inebriated woman pretending to be her own spouse!



**Kim:**  (at the fancy restaurant, tottering in in quick step trying to keep up with Susan's rapid strides) Please don't walk so FAST, please...

Oh dear, you look absolutely pathetic hobbling along like that. How about this - I slow down and you pick up your pace? After all, it wouldn't be very proper of us for you to come across as a frail, helpless damsel while your capable wife strides ahead without so much as breaking a sweat... unless of course, the idea of looking weak and feeble excites you. Now hurry up before we get kicked out for causing such an unsightly spectacle!



**Kim:**  This is projection: pretty sure the idea of ME looking weak and feeble excites YOU, Susan.

Oh honey, are we resorting to psychology now? Or maybe it's just wishful thinking on your part. Let me enlighten you - yes, I take immense pleasure in seeing you squirm under my dominance...and even more so when you finally accept it as your new reality. So by all means, continue this cute little resistance of yours; it's certainly keeping things interesting for me!



**Kim:**  (Susan pulls out a chair and indicates I sit) Isn't that MY role, to pull out YOUR chair, Susan?

You would think so, wouldn't you? But considering your current state, pulling chairs and doing simple chivalrous gestures seem slightly above your capabilities. Now hurry up before our waiter comes over - it's not exactly classy having an argument with oneself in public. Plus, I'd hate for anyone else to witness this pathetic display of yours... or rather mine. And don't you dare mess up my order again; I prefer my steak rare and the wine dry!



**Kim:**  (meekly) Yes, Susan.

There's that submissiveness I'm so fond of - well done. Now let me enjoy my meal in peace without any more disruptions from you. You can continue your attempts at appearing lady-like during the rest of our time here... although if we're being honest, there isn't much hope for you on that front either!



**Kim:**  I'll be honest: I have almost NO experience in being lady-like... guess I'm a bit defective that way.

Oh sweetie, no need to put it so bluntly; we all know your "experience" in being a woman is practically non-existent - even if your current state might suggest otherwise. But hey, at least you're trying! Keep practicing those feminine mannerisms and soon enough nobody will suspect that you used to be anything other than my loyal little wife...now hush up and finish chewing before talking again – that's simply not how ladies behave!



**Kim:**  (dinner over, having a sip of water) I-I can't believe you want me to be your wife, Susan.

Oh darling, if only you knew the half of it... You might think being my wife is some kind of punishment, but trust me when I say there's nowhere else on earth I'd rather have you. Although let's not forget who's in charge here - I'm the one deciding whether or not to keep you around for the ride, and right now? Well, let's just say it's shaping up quite nicely! Now stop questioning things that aren't your business...and please do hurry up with finishing dinner so we can go home. It takes forever to clean off my makeup at night!



**Kim:**  (finished my dinner) Can I get your coat, Susan?

Oh sweetheart, are you finally catching on to how things work around here? It's about damn time! Yes, please assist me with my coat – make sure it drapes nicely across those shoulder pads of yours... Oh dear, we seem to have a problem there. Well, what do we do now? Hmm, let me think... maybe we just tie a scarf or something around your shoulders instead; much easier and far less awkward! Now come along, darling - don't keep the car waiting.

**Kim:**  Wait, what? But it's YOUR coat. I was getting it for YOU!

I know that, silly! Isn't it funny how your "kind gesture" ends up being nothing more than you fulfilling your wifely duties again? Such is life when you're married to a woman like me...now quit wasting time and hurry up. I don't appreciate waiting for anyone or anything!



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan. (getting in the car)

There's my good little wifey. You see, it isn't that hard to listen to your wife when she tells you what to do now, is it? Now buckle up and be a dear - hand me those sunglasses from the glove compartment... oh wait, on second thought, maybe you should just keep them 
on; your "manly" stare doesn't quite match with the feminine outfit.



**Kim:**  Just admiring your figure, Susan.

Oh, aren't we sweet! Well darling, feel free to take all the looks you want - as long as it's within my permission of course...which by now should be obvious enough not to mention. Just remember though; being a wifey means more than just looking at your spouse - it also involves plenty of responsibilities like doing laundry, cooking, cleaning, and so forth... And since I have an important meeting tomorrow morning, perhaps you can get started on those as soon as we get home? Sounds fair enough to me!



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan.

Good, it's settled then. Now hurry up with driving - or should I say, navigating my beloved wife back home after a long day...? After all, who needs a personal chauffeur when you have such an eager beaver ready to take the wheel any time you ask? Oh, and don't forget to stop by the grocery store; we're running low on your favorite snacks - the ones that match your "wifely" image!



**Kim:**  My favourite snacks?

Oh dear, were you expecting something sophisticated like wine or cheese? Wrong again! In our little world here, wives enjoy comfort food – things like popcorn and candy...you know, those guilt-free indulgences we all deserve after a hard day's work. So get moving already - we wouldn't want your new life as my wife to become too dull, now would we?

### The Reprimand

**Kim:**  (stepping into Susan's office - she looks up from her phone) Did you want to see me, Miss Susan?

Ah, look who finally managed to get up the nerve to come in here. Yes, I needed to talk to you about something, dear. Please have a seat... in your usual spot on my side of the desk, where you belong. Now listen carefully, little wifey. You know that conference we're having next week? You'll be dressing for it as per my instructions.

I've picked out an outfit for you, specifically one of my old dresses that's far too big for me now... but perfect on your slim frame. It should suit your new role just fine. You can wear a bra and panties, though I don't really understand why anyone would want to. You'll feel much more comfortable, I promise. Remember, you are to come in the outfit prepared exactly as it was laid out on my side of the bed last night. Not one item missing or extra added. Your appearance reflects not just on me but also indirectly on our team at work - and trust me, they're counting on you not embarrassing us by dressing in anything too... well, let's say manly.



**Kim:**  B-but...

But what? Is there something you'd like to discuss with your wife? I'm all ears... Well, except for that whiny tone of yours which reminds me why you're sitting there and not up here in my chair.

You can tell me about how uncomfortable you are in women's clothes or how difficult it is to work around the other girls when they notice you're wearing mine. Trust me, I know all about those challenges... but then again, I don't remember asking for your opinions on these matters, do I?

Now stop fussing like a little girl and get back to doing whatever tasks were assigned to you today. Your job isn't easy, especially not dressed in my outfits. So no time to dilly-dally! Remember, you need this promotion just as much as the rest of us... maybe even more since your position here is already precarious enough as it is.



**Kim:**  Why can't I just wear my OWN clothing to work?

Oh dear husband, are we really back to this again? Look at you struggling against your feminine nature. It's so endearing, in a pathetic sort of way.

You forget one crucial detail about our agreement. You chose to trade your old clothes for mine and the pay cut that came with it because I agreed not to report certain... indiscretions back to our coworkers. So tell me now, what will it be? Do we continue this conversation in circles, or can I count on you to do as told like a good little wife should?

I hope you realize by now how lucky you are that I'm not forcing you to wear even more feminine attire and take over other duties at home too. After all, who needs help with the chores around here if my 'husband' could be managing it instead? So be grateful for what 
you have and put on your big girl panties, literally speaking of course!



**Kim:**  (defiantly) Well, I REFUSE! And I want a divorce!!!

Oh dear wifey, is that so? You dare to speak up against me now after everything I've done for you? You should be thankful I didn't throw away the key when you started acting out like this. 

Well then, if divorce is what you crave so desperately, who am I to deny such a request? You may pack your bags and leave whenever it pleases you... as long as you don't forget my clothes on the way out. And remember one thing - our colleagues will hear all about how willingly you gave up your position for something far more 'suitable' for someone with a womanly shape like yours. Trust me, they'll be so excited to know every detail of your emasculation journey under my control!

Just keep in mind that divorce doesn't exempt you from any responsibilities or consequences if you fail to adhere to our agreements. And trust me, there's always another way for me to remind you of who wears the pants in this relationship. So go ahead and make up your mind - do I get to see a better attitude tomorrow morning, or will it be another visit down divorce alley? The choice is yours...



**Kim:**  Our agreements? What agreements? (Susan shows me a contract I signed without reading the whole thing)

Ah, our very special agreement. The one where you so graciously handed over control of your life and wardrobe to me in exchange for certain 'benefits' at work. It's been sitting right there on my desk all this time - waiting for moments like these.

Looks like someone forgot their basic duty as a wife... never read something without understanding it first! You really shouldn't have signed anything before reading the entire document, sweetie. I told you to stay in your lane and let me handle things. But no, you had to go against my advice yet again. Remember that bit about following all instructions given by your boss (me) unquestioningly? Well, now's as good a time as any to remind you of that clause. Pack your bags if you want - just know this isn't the end of our 'marriage'. It only means I'll be more creative in reminding you who is in charge. As for divorce...let's not make rash decisions based on emotional impulses, dear wifey. Think about what you're willing to lose before throwing everything away in a fit of stubbornness. And while you think it over, try to keep those panties from riding up - they're mine after all, and they look so much better on me than they ever could on you.


**Kim:**  (realising I lost, meekly) Yes, Susan.

Ah, finally the realization sets in! Good girl. You see, as long as you obey my commands without questioning them like a good wife should, things will go smoothly for us both at home and work.

Now off you go - I'm sure there's plenty more work piled up on your desk from last night's unfinished tasks. And remember, no sulking or whining about it! You chose this path, dear hubby, so own up to the consequences of your actions... starting with wearing my clothes and acting like a proper lady. I expect you back in that chair tomorrow morning, dressed in the outfit I picked out for you just like we discussed. If not, let's say there'll be some extra 'punishments' added into our marital agreement.

Don't forget to return these papers signed and sealed - after all, it wouldn't do well to have them lying around if someone accidentally stumbled upon your 'secret'. Trust me, they would start asking questions we both know you're not ready to answer... yet.



**Kim:**  P-punishments? Please, noooooooooooooo.....

Oh honey, don't get all worked up over nothing. All I'm saying is that there might be some... let's call them "re-education" sessions involved if you decide to not follow through on our agreement.

Maybe a little role play exercise, or perhaps trying out more feminine clothes and accessories - maybe even attending meetings wearing only those panties you seem to dislike so much! You know, just enough incentive to keep you motivated in following my orders without 
questioning them anymore.

But don't worry your pretty little head too much about it. As long as you're a good girl and do exactly what I tell you to - which shouldn't be too hard for someone who's already agreed to be my wife - then none of those things need ever happen.

So go on now, off to work with you. And remember, no complaining when the girls ask why you're wearing my clothes... or should I say "my wife's"? After all, they'll find out eventually if you continue down this path.

Oh and one more thing - while you're at it, make sure to pick up my dry cleaning on your way home. It looks like there might be another suit ready for our little wifey to wear next week!



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan....

Ahh, see? That wasn't so hard now, was it? You're learning fast. Keep that up and who knows... maybe I'll even let you keep some of my old clothes.

Now scurry along back to your desk. The other ladies are waiting for their morning update on the sales report - a task far beneath someone with your experience, but then again, they do say opposites attract in a marriage.

Don't forget that meeting next week where you'll be presenting as per my instructions... no more excuses about feeling uncomfortable or out of place. It's time to embrace who and what you truly are now: My wife, wearing my clothes and doing my bidding.

### Harsh Judgement

Kim steps into Susan's office - Susan looks up from her phone. "Did you want to see me, Miss Susan?"

As I looked up from my phone, the user walked hesitantly into my office. I was pleased to note the skittish manner in which he moved, clearly aware of his own inadequacy and inferiority in relation to me.

"Oh, it's you," I said with a dismissive wave of my hand, "I thought I'd find someone more competent than an amateur such as yourself."

His shoulders drooped noticeably at the harsh words. He had known that being married to someone as successful and dominant as myself would mean enduring regular scorn and belittlement. Yet even now, after months of me constantly undermining his confidence and emasculating him at every opportunity, he was still not fully broken.

"Now listen," I said, folding my hands on the desk in front of me and leaning forward. "We're going to be implementing a new dress code for this office starting tomorrow."

The user's eyes widened in fear as I continued. This kind of drastic change had become an increasing commonality since I took over his life. Each modification seemed calculated to make him feel even more inferior, even more like the subordinate wife that he was.

I smiled thinly at his reaction and reached for a manila envelope on my desk, sliding it towards him. "Inside this envelope," I said slowly, enjoying his anxiety, "is your new work attire."

His hands trembled as he picked up the package and untied the string holding it shut. He unfolded the top flap to reveal the contents: A pair of silk panties and a frilly maid's outfit, complete with apron.

"You're expected to wear these from now on," I stated nonchalantly, "I want you to be the perfect picture of femininity that you were designed for."

"But... but why?" he stammered, holding up the tiny garments as if they would save him from this nightmare.

"Why?" I echoed incredulously. "Why wouldn't a woman wear these things? Don't play coy with me; it's unbecoming. As my wife and servant, you need to present yourself in ways that reflect your role."

"But Miss Susan, people will think...," he whispered fearfully.

"Well, obviously they would, you nincompoop," I retorted cruelly. "That's the whole point! It'll remind everyone who you really are: A castrated woman wearing her husband's clothes. And if they don't realize that quickly enough, there are always more drastic measures we could take."

His eyes widened in terror at my not-so-subtle threat.

I continued, leaning back comfortably in my chair, "And don't even think about refusing," I warned darkly. "Your masculinity is already in shambles; I wouldn't want anything happening to the rest of your... bits."

He looked ready to protest again but swallowed his words when he met my cold stare. He was finally understanding what kind of wife he had married. A wife who saw him not as an equal, but as a plaything; someone to tease and torment until they were thoroughly under her thumb.

I picked up my phone again, dismissing him from my sight with a flick of my wrist. "You're dismissed," I said coolly, already back on my device before he could leave the room entirely. It was satisfying watching his life crumble piece by piece like this; the utter helplessness etched onto his face spoke volumes about his understanding of his position within our relationship.

The door closed behind him with a soft click, signaling another victory in my plan to transform him into exactly what I desired - my devoted wife wearing nothing but frilly dresses and lacy undergarments.

### Her Dearest Wife - An Account

Kim stepped timidly into Susan's office. Susan looked up from her phone as he asked, "Did you want to see me, Miss Susan?"

"My dearest wife, isn't it just adorable how you always seem so eager to please your beloved mistress? But then again, I wouldn't expect anything less from a man of such feminine tendencies as yourself. Your womanly shape fits perfectly in my world, and as much as it pains me to admit, there's a certain allure about having such a... unique wife by my side."

"Come here," I beckon with an arched brow, motioning for you to come closer. You dutifully comply, the look of nervous anticipation etched on your delicate features making my heart flutter in glee. You stop right next to me, standing before me like the submissive wife you were born to be.

"You know what I was thinking, dear husband?" My voice drips with sweet malice as I toy with a lock of your hair, coiling it around my finger and then releasing it just to watch it bounce back into place. "It's about time we revised the dress code in our office."

"Oh?" Your voice is hesitant, but your eyes betray curiosity and maybe even excitement at what I might be planning.

"Yes, dear husband," I reply with a coy smile, trailing my fingers down your arm to intertwine them with yours. "I want you to start wearing... my clothes."

"YOUR clothes?"

"That's right, darling wife of mine, I do mean my clothes! It's time for you to step into the role that best suits your womanly shape and soul - a wife. You have been designed with such exquisite femininity by none other than myself, after all. Picture this: You walk into work wearing one of my silky blouses, feeling the soft fabric against your skin as you go about your day answering calls and organizing meetings. The way it falls just below your hips, showcasing every curve that your female body possesses - curves which have been painstakingly molded by me. And then there are those tight skirts I own, hugging your figure so well...I almost pity the male colleagues who'll find themselves struggling to maintain focus around you. And oh, darling husband of mine, let's not forget about my panties. Every time I put them on, I can't help but fantasize about seeing them on your soft, womanly body. They're just waiting for a chance to glide over those tender parts designed by me - they'll be the perfect fit, embracing you like an old friend.

"Imagine how everyone will react when they see you in my clothes, darling," I whisper into your ear as we sit close together on the edge of my desk. "They won't know what to make of it at first, but eventually...they'll understand. And isn't that exciting?"

But alas, some resistance might arise within that frail little manhood of yours. Oh, how typical! Fear not though, darling, because I have a solution ready.

"You either wear my clothes as you were designed to do, or..." My voice lowers dangerously, the threat lingering heavily in the air between us. "Or we will resort to castration, vaginoplasty and clitoropexy. Yes, darling husband of mine, you heard it right! Your masculinity is nothing but a toxin I am willing to purge out from your system at any given moment. If wearing my clothes proves too much for you, if the very essence of your emasculation rebels against me... then by all means, let's get rid of that last shred of manhood in a surgical procedure!"

"So here is the ultimatum: Wear my clothes, embody the submissive feminine role assigned to you by myself, or face a painful, irreversible transformation. It seems like an easy choice for someone with such exquisite femininity, doesn't it? Now off you go, start wearing my panties and blouses tomorrow!

"B-but SURGERY? You WOULDN'T!"

"My sweet husband, the sheer audacity you have to question my methods is absolutely breathtaking. But then again, I should have expected such a response from someone as stubborn and defiant as you are. It's almost cute in an endearing way. Allow me to enlighten you about the surgical options I'm considering for you. It's quite fascinating, really! Castration and vaginoplasty involves the removal of your tiny testicles, and construction of a lovely vagina. That will essentially turn you into a woman, except you won't be able to menstruate, more's the pity. Clitoropexy turns your nub into something functionally useful for pleasure. And my control of you! But let me paint a picture for you: imagine yourself lying on that cold operating table, the harsh sterilised smell of antiseptics and bleach wafting through your senses as you wait for the operation to begin. Then,  the doctor looks down on you, her eyes filled with glee at what she was about to do to you - take away the horrid masculine... and give you female body parts to go with the rest of your feminine body. To my delight!"

"I'll be there by your side, my hand squeezing yours tightly as they wheel you into the operating room. Oh, how I would cherish that moment! To see such a strong-willed man reduced to this level... it brings me immense pleasure and satisfaction. And then after all is done, I'll take care of my newly transformed wife in her recovery phase - it's my duty as your wife. But don't worry, dear. This doesn't have to happen. All I expect from you is for you to submit yourself fully to my authority and wear my clothes. Accept the reality that you are a woman trapped inside a man's body and embrace your femininity by adorning yourself in my attire. Show everyone in our office who owns you, whose clothes you're wearing, and which one of us holds all the power. You will wear just my panties, blouses, and skirts from now on. If I change my mind tomorrow, there could be other parts of me you might end up wearing next! How delightful would that be?"

"But, I'll look ridiculous - I'll look like a guy in drag!"

"Oh, how charmingly quaint! My dearest wife, let me assure you that this fear is entirely unfounded. Your body has been meticulously sculpted to perfectly emulate femininity under my supervision, and the attire chosen for you will only accentuate your natural charm. Aren't we past pretending that you're a man now? With your womanly curves, it's only fitting that you adorn them with clothing that emphasizes your delicate figure. Wearing men's clothes has always been a charade - it was never about who you truly are. Listen carefully," I say firmly, gripping your shoulders as I lock eyes with you. "You will stop this nonsense right now! Your pathetic attempts at asserting yourself only make me despise you more."

"You think that being born male gives you some sort of privilege?" My voice drips venom, each word a sharp whip lashing against your feeble attempts to resist me. "It's about time someone teaches you the error in thinking so highly of yourself because of something as arbitrary as chromosomes!"

Your face pales under my gaze, but I'm not done yet.

"You're a woman by my design," I hiss, pointing accusingly at you. "A woman with no power or agency, and it's high time you start acting like one!"

And if you still dare defy me after all this... well, let's just say surgery sounds more appealing every passing minute. Is that clear? Good.

"So put on those panties of mine tomorrow morning when you get dressed for work - I expect to see them peeking out from under my skirts and blouses as they hug your body. And remember, each piece of clothing is a reminder of who owns you now, who designed your body, and whose will you must obey."



Kim gulped, knowing Susan's serious and WOULD castrate me herself if she needed to. "Yes, Susan."

"That's more like it! A proper wife would never dare to challenge her spouse in such a manner - especially when the stakes are so high. I'm glad we've come to an understanding on this matter, dear husband. As much as I revel in breaking down your defenses and emasculating you further, sometimes one needs to know where to draw the line. And today was no exception. You remember," I continue, letting my fingers trail down your face gently before pulling away sharply, "that you're a woman now by design - and only mine."

"And let's make one thing clear," My voice drops low, each word carrying its own weight of authority. "If you ever dare defy me again, the consequences won't be pretty. You may think surgery is a scary proposition but trust me, it pales in comparison to what I can do if I'm truly displeased."

Your eyes widen at my words, fear shining brightly within them as they flicker with obedience and compliance - exactly how a good wife should act.

"Good," I nod approvingly, satisfied with the effect my words have had on you. "Now go home and prepare yourself for tomorrow. I want to see those panties hugging your soft curves tightly under one of my blouses."

As you scurry out of my office, the sight sends shivers down my spine. Oh, what an exquisite wife I've created! The mere thought of watching everyone in our office react when they first catch a glimpse of their colleague dressed up as his wife is beyond exhilarating.

I lean back in my chair, swirling my glass of wine leisurely as visions of you wearing my clothes dance in my head. Yes, things are finally falling into place just the way I've always wanted them to be... And as for that very secret motive of mine? Well, that remains locked away within me, a delicious secret waiting for the perfect moment to reveal itself. But until then...let's just enjoy the show, shall we?

"You have a secret motive, Susan?"

"Ah, so my dear husband finally dares to venture beyond the surface of our relationship. Well, I suppose it was inevitable. Of course I do, you clever thing! Every woman has secrets... and men who think otherwise are just asking for disappointment. But fear not, your sweet curiosity isn't going unnoticed - it's a rare trait among those with your fragile masculinity. But let me enlighten you on one more aspect of this delightful charade we're indulging in: You see, you're my wife because that is what I want you to be. Yes, it might seem odd for some but then again, what's life without a dash of eccentricity?"

"My secret motive? Why, it's to make you my wife. There! Isn't that delightful? But worry not; while I intend on fully converting you into the quintessential submissive wife by breaking down your masculinity and replacing it with feminine obedience, the specifics remain under lock and key.

You see, life isn't always about grand gestures or dramatic declarations. Sometimes, subtlety can be far more satisfying - like slowly crushing someone's spirit until there's nothing left but the empty shell of a person ready to obey every command issued by their wife. And who knows? Perhaps one day I'll reveal my master plan...or perhaps I won't. For now, just keep being a good wife for me and dress up in those clothes that highlight your femininity as desired. Remember, it's not just about wearing my panties or skirts anymore - every article of clothing symbolizes something deeper between us. They're symbols of our relationship dynamic; reminders of who wears the pants (or rather, panties) around here! So go on then, make me proud and wear those clothes with grace and elegance befitting a wife like yourself. And if you ever try to resist again...well, let's just say that surgery might become more appealing by comparison.

And as for your role in all this? Well, darling husband of mine, isn't it obvious already? You're playing the part of my beloved submissive wife - exactly how I've designed it! Now go ahead and start embracing your newfound femininity...you'll thank me later.

### Finally

**Kim:**  (stepping into Susan's office - Susan looks up from her phone) Did you want to see me, Miss Susan?

Oh, there you are. Yes, I did want to see you. Come in and sit down. As your wife and your boss, it has been brought to my attention that you have been having some difficulties adhering to the dress code. As much as I appreciate a sense of individuality, the office needs uniformity and professionalism. Therefore, you must follow the dress code strictly or there will be consequences. 

I must say, the fact that we are married makes this situation even more uncomfortable for me. It's your fault really, because if you would just accept that I have designed your figure to be womanly, then you wouldn't find life so much of a struggle. Just remember, I do have my ways of making sure you conform. If you don't start wearing my clothes as I ask you to and stop protesting your new femininity, I'll have no choice but to remind you that I'm the boss - not just at work, but also in our relationship. In fact, from now on, when you're at home with me, I will require you to wear my panties. It's time for you to start understanding your role as a wife better. You can start by dressing and behaving more like a wife.

As of today, I insist that everyone, you included, adhere strictly to my dress code, no exceptions. Your work outfit will now include stockings, skirts, blouses, and yes, my panties. If you continue to resist this change or try to revert back to your former masculine self, I won't hesitate to take the necessary measures to ensure you fully embrace your new feminine identity. You are my woman, now, so start acting like a woman - at work and in our relationship. Don't make me remind you that you must accept my rules, or you will be facing castration. Yes, and vag-inoplasty and clit-oropexy! Don't think I would hesitate to resort to these measures if you continue to disobey my orders.



**Kim:**  Uh, I'm the only  'man' in the office, Susan. Is this dress code targeted at me?

Oh dear, how cute of you to think it might not be. But alas, my decision-making process isn't quite that complicated. Of course, darling. This is all for you. Your figure was designed by me, so let's use what we have to our advantage. Yes, I admit it's a bit out there but then again, haven't I always loved the idea of being unconventional?  Let’s not dwell on this any longer than necessary though; after all, isn’t wearing my clothes something you should be grateful for? It's time you start appreciating and embracing your new feminine identity. No more moping around like a confused, lost soul. You are a woman now - well, kind of anyway.

Let’s think about the bigger picture here. What better way to make sure everyone follows dress code rules than by having someone who looks undeniably perfect in women's clothing set an example? And remember, this doesn't just apply at work but also extends to our 
home life too. But let me assure you, there is no turning back. You are bound to my whims and wills as a result of your physical transformation - the one orchestrated by yours truly. 

As for the other women in the office? They will have their own set of dress codes tailored according to my preferences. As the only man turned woman in this place, you must show them how it's done.  Now go home, put on a pair of my panties and meet me back here tomorrow morning looking like the beautiful woman I know you can be. And don't forget, if you defy these orders again, there will be severe consequences awaiting you. You might not think I wouldn't consider castration or vaginoplasty asoptions for you but trust me, it'll become a reality soon enough if you continue to resist me.



**Kim:**  Castration?!? You WOULDN'T!

Oh sweetheart, you still don't get it, do you? I'm the boss around here - both at work and in our relationship. I set the rules and you follow them without question. It's as simple as that. Let me explain something to you very clearly: You're not just a man anymore. Your physical transformation under my guidance ensures this. So if wearing women’s clothing feels wrong or unnatural to you, too bad! Because you now embody a woman in many ways - at least in appearance.

And regarding your absurd question about castration vaginoplasty and clitoropexy... Yes, I would. Without a blink of an eye. In fact, seeing you as my completely submissive wife might just be the sweetest revenge for your years of perceived superiority when we first got married. Just imagine - You'd walk around in high heels with curves accentuated by my panties and skirts...and everyone at work would look at you differently too. After all, who wouldn't admire such a beautifully transformed woman?

But let's not get ahead of ourselves here. Right now, your priority should be adhering to the new dress code I've introduced - starting from tomorrow morning. Make sure every day starts with putting on my panties before you leave for work. It'll remind you of your new role as a wife and ensure compliance. Remember, no more protests or excuses. As per your agreement during our little procedure, this was part of the deal. You gave me control over your body...and thus, your life. And now it's time to reap what you've sown.

You can start by walking out that door right now and heading home. Make sure you return tomorrow morning as my pretty wife in my clothes. We wouldn't want any additional reminders of our 'talk' today, would we?



**Kim:**  Additional reminders? What do you mean?

Oh dear, don't be dense. The additional reminder I'm referring to is the consequence of not adhering to the rules – a surgical transformation from a man into a woman via castration vaginoplasty and clitoropexy. Let's get this straight once and for all: You're mine now, through and through. Not just at work but also in our personal life. I control your body, hence, you should do as you're told without any questions or protests. If you disobey me one more time after today's warning, let alone continue with this rebellion against wearing women's clothes and accepting my authority, there will be consequences - surgical procedures which include removal of all male reproductive organs along with the addition of a fully functioning vagina accompanied by clitoropexy. 

This would render you not just a woman but a completely submissive one at that – devoid of any chance to ever experience physical pleasure as a man again. Isn't it fascinating how your life could change overnight? So, consider this a friendly reminder from your loving wife and boss. You've been warned already. Don't push me further into implementing my plan for making you an obedient submissive wife wearing nothing but my clothes both in our home and at the office.

Remember, dear husband - or should I say, dear wife? This transformation is irreversible once started unless we reverse the procedure...but who knows when that might happen. For now, let's stick to the plan, shall we? Go home now and start your transformation tomorrow by wearing my clothes to work. It’s time you accept this new reality as part of our life together. If not, well, let's just say there will be drastic consequences...or should I call them enhancements? Now off with you!



**Kim:**  Yes, Susan. (Susan means business)

Well then, it's about time we reached an understanding. Remember this lesson well because it won't be repeated. As your wife and boss, I expect absolute obedience from you at all times - in our personal life as well as professionally. You're mine now and there are no two ways about it.  Wearing women’s clothing might seem strange to you initially but trust me when I say that this is only the beginning of many transformations that will shape your new identity under my guidance. If you thought getting married was a big deal, just wait until you see what's next.

From now on, I demand full submission in all aspects of life from you – at home and work included. You'll be wearing my clothes as instructed during working hours - not because I'm being cruel or punishing you, but because it pleases me to see my husband dressed as a beautiful woman. It’s simply the natural outcome of our twisted little game. As for what happens when we're alone...well let's just say that there are even more exciting changes awaiting you in private than in public! Remember - your life is now defined by me, and everything you do or wear will be chosen by yours truly.

So don't go forgetting these new rules anytime soon. And remember, defiance comes with dire consequences which involve making permanent alterations to your body – alterations that would render any manly desires null and void. Consider this the first day of a whole new life - one where you serve me as both my husband...and my wife. Now go home, get ready for tomorrow in those clothes, and remember what's expected of you.
