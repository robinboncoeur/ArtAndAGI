A cinematic fine-tuned model for high-detail, character-rich realism

"Illustrious Realism by klaabu" is a high-fidelity model fine-tuned on top of the Illustrious framework, enhanced for realism, texture depth, and stronger control over nuanced facial and body features. It has been tuned to preserve the cinematic essence of Illustrious while elevating clarity and dynamic lighting.
