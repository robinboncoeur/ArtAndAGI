LYRICS:

Tourists stumble down Broadway  
Cumberland keeps claiming bodies  
All our best memories  
Were bought and then turned into apartments  
The club with all the hardcore shows  
Now just a greyscale Dominos  
The churches overflow each Sunday greedy Sunday morning  

Gift shop in the lobby  
Act like God ain’t watching   
Kill the soul, turn a profit  
What lives on? Southern Gotham  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones   
Cause I’m a true believer  

They put up chainlink fences underneath the biggest bridges  
They pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all the children  
They say that Jesus is the way but then they gave him a white face  
So they don’t have to pray to someone they deem lesser than them  

The South will not rise again  
Til it’s paid for every sin  
Strange fruit, hard bargain  
Till the roots, Southern Gotham  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
Cause I’m a true believer  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
Cause I’m a true believer  




## Notes

I think that approach is exactly how you reclaim the steering wheel.

Keeping the same images but changing the captions works because, on DA, **the caption is the frame**: it tells the algorithm *and* the reader what they’re supposed to be seeing. If you swap “body/embarrassment/coercion” language for “identity/social optics/choice/relationship,” the very same picture stops reading like a setup and starts reading like a scene.

A few guardrails that will keep it subtle *and* still sharp:

## What to lean into

### 1) Make it about *social meaning*, not anatomy

Instead of “you have boobs / can’t hide,” go for:

* “You can’t hide behind oversized clothes anymore.”
* “You’re becoming visible in a way you didn’t plan for.”
* “The line between costume and self is thinning.”

It keeps the theme while removing the fetish “body-fixation” hooks.

### 2) Keep Celeste’s power in *interpretation*

Celeste doesn’t need to say “wear this.” She can say:

* “That look says something. Decide what you want it to say.”
* “You’re not being punished. You’re being edited.”

That reads as confident and psychologically astute rather than kink-coded.

### 3) Keep the humour, but aim it upward

Mock the *social script*, not Charlie’s embarrassment.

* “People will label you either way. Pick the label you can live with.”
* “If you’re going to be stared at, at least be intentional.”

That’s the kind of wit that tends to land with women readers.

## What to avoid (the “subtlety killers”)

These are the words/beats that turn subtle into “oh, it’s that genre”:

* underwear talk
* “reluctant / forced / punishment / training”
* humiliation beats (“exposed,” “everyone will laugh,” etc.)
* parent/authority coercion as the engine (“mum made you,” “teacher insisted,” etc.)

## A simple template you can reuse

For each captioned image, try this 3-line structure:

1. **Observation** (neutral, visual)
2. **Meaning** (social/psychological)
3. **Choice** (agency line)

Example:

* “She stared at the mirror too long.”
* “Not because she looked wrong — because she looked *different*.”
* “And different meant she’d have to decide who got to name it.”

That’s subtle, but still unmistakably your theme.

If you paste one of your current “old style” captions and tell me what you want the *new* takeaway to be, I’ll rewrite it in 3–5 variants: (a) wry, (b) tender, (c) icy Celeste, (d) minimalist.
