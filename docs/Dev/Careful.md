LYRICS:

Tourists stumble down Broadway  
Cumberland keeps claiming bodies  
All our best memories  
Were bought and then turned into apartments  
The club with all the hardcore shows  
Now just a greyscale Dominos  
The churches overflow each Sunday greedy Sunday morning  

Gift shop in the lobby  
Act like God ain’t watching   
Kill the soul, turn a profit  
What lives on? Southern Gotham  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones   
Cause I’m a true believer  

They put up chainlink fences underneath the biggest bridges  
They pose in Christmas cards with guns as big as all the children  
They say that Jesus is the way but then they gave him a white face  
So they don’t have to pray to someone they deem lesser than them  

The South will not rise again  
Til it’s paid for every sin  
Strange fruit, hard bargain  
Till the roots, Southern Gotham  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
Cause I’m a true believer  

I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
With my belief  
And I’m the one who still loves your ghost  
I reanimate your bones  
Cause I’m a true believer
