Documentary-style photo in a modern, women-run atelier workroom in warm morning light. The same late-blooming eighteen-year-old youth stands beside a worktable, slim with narrow shoulders and a boyish face with faint freckles, wearing no makeup and no jewelry. His very long brown hair is tied into a low ponytail with a few loose tendrils, the ponytail hanging down his back.  
He is wearing women’s 1770s clothing as two separate garments in solid deep indigo wool: an open-front outer gown worn over a separate matching indigo petticoat. The outer gown is worn visibly open, with the two front edges clearly separated so the petticoat is visible between them as the walking space from waist to hem. The outer gown falls to ankle length, and the petticoat hem peeks slightly below as a distinct second hem. The bodice has an 18th-century fitted shape and closes with pins over a separate stomacher panel, so the centre front reads as pinned fabric rather than modern fastenings. A white linen shift is a separate garment and is visible only at the edge of the square neckline and at the sleeve cuffs, with a softly gathered shift edge.  
This is a fitting range-of-motion test: one hand lightly holds the left front edge of the gown aside at the waist to show the walking space, while the other arm is raised to test the underarm seam; chin down, eyes on the underarm seam, focused neutral expression. White tennis shoes are worn and clearly visible beneath the hem on the studio floor.  
The worktable is close in frame with a sewing machine, a red thread spool, indigo wool fabric pieces, a tape measure, pins, tailor’s chalk, and an open ledger or policy binder, making the scene feel like a candid documentary moment in an active atelier.
