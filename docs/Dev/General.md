### Image Prompts

[Q]  
I understand you do not generate prompts for AI images. I'm looking for a clue to have my character do something specific in an image, like spray perfume on her writsts or try on a hat. Even getting character to climb into a car seems too hard for Stable Diffusion. Would you have any suggestions on how to proceed?

---

[Emily]  
If you're looking for a specific action or behavior to be depicted in an AI-generated image, such as your character spraying perfume on her wrists or trying on a hat, it can be challenging to achieve precise control over the generated image using Stable Diffusion or similar AI models. These models are designed to generate more abstract and artistic images rather than specific, guided actions.

However, there are a few alternative approaches you can consider:

1. Visual Reference: Provide a detailed description or visual reference of the desired action to a professional illustrator or artist. They can create a custom illustration or artwork that accurately depicts the specific action you have in mind.

2. Image Manipulation: If you have existing images or photographs, you can use image manipulation software or tools to add the desired action or behavior. Software like Adobe Photoshop or free alternatives like GIMP can help you achieve this by overlaying or integrating elements into the original image.

3. Collaborate with an Illustrator: Engage with an illustrator or graphic designer who specializes in character design or digital art. They can work closely with you to bring your vision to life and create custom illustrations or digital artwork that precisely depict the desired actions or behaviors.

These approaches may provide you with more control and specificity in realizing the desired actions or behaviors in images. Remember to communicate your requirements clearly and provide visual references or detailed descriptions to facilitate the process.

While AI models have made significant progress in generating images, achieving specific actions or behaviors can still be challenging. Human creativity and expertise often play a crucial role in capturing precise actions or scenarios in visual art.

### Text Generators

[Q]  
What are the needed components for a text generation system such as H2Ogpt?

---

[Emily]  
A text generation system like H2Ogpt, based on OpenAI's GPT architecture, typically requires several key components to function effectively. Here are the essential components:

1. **Model Architecture**: The core of the system is the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, which is a type of deep learning architecture. The model is trained on a large dataset of text to learn patterns, relationships, and language structures.

2. **Pre-trained Weights**: Before fine-tuning for specific tasks, the GPT model is pre-trained on a vast corpus of text data. These pre-trained weights capture general language knowledge and are crucial for the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

3. **Fine-tuning Data**: To make the system more task-specific, fine-tuning is performed on a narrower dataset related to the specific domain or application. This dataset contains examples of input-output pairs relevant to the desired text generation tasks.

4. **Tokenization**: Text data needs to be tokenized into smaller units (tokens) before feeding them into the GPT model. Tokenization helps the model process and understand the text efficiently.

5. **Language Model Inference**: The process of generating text involves using the trained model to infer the most likely sequence of words or tokens given a starting prompt or context.

6. **Probability Distributions**: During text generation, the model generates text probabilistically, considering the likelihood of different words or tokens given the previous context. Probability distributions help the model select the most appropriate word or token at each step.

7. **Beam Search (Optional)**: Beam search is a technique used during text generation to explore multiple possible sequences of words, helping to find higher-quality outputs.

8. **Nucleus Sampling (Optional)**: Nucleus sampling, also known as top-k sampling, is another technique that controls text generation by considering only the top-k most probable tokens at each step.

9. **Post-processing and Formatting**: The generated text often requires post-processing to correct grammar, punctuation, and ensure overall coherence.

10. **GPU or TPU Hardware (Optional)**: Training and inference of large GPT models can be computationally intensive. Using specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs can significantly speed up the process.

These components work together to enable the text generation system like H2Ogpt to produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on the provided input or prompts.

[Q]  
Thank you. I now have a starting point to see how I can understand this better. I may have more questions for you later.

---

[Emily]  
You're welcome! I'm glad I could provide you with a starting point to understand text generation systems better. If you have more questions or need further clarification in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to help, and I'll be happy to assist you with any further inquiries you may have. Happy learning, and best of luck with your endeavors!

## Role Play

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103au.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
I want you to act as a dream interpreter. I will give you descriptions of my dreams, and you will provide interpretations based on the symbols and themes present in the dream. Do not provide personal opinions or assumptions about the dreamer. Provide only complete interpretations based on the information given. My dream is about showing up in school in a cheerleader dress, and no one notices or says anything about it, and I keep trying to hide until school's out.

---

[Emily]  
Interpretation:

Dreams about being in school and wearing a cheerleader dress while going unnoticed and attempting to hide can be symbolic of feelings of insecurity, a desire for attention or validation, and a fear of judgment or rejection. Let's break down the different elements present in the dream:

1. School: School often represents a place of learning, growth, and social interactions. It can also symbolize authority figures and rules. Being in school in your dream suggests that there may be areas in your waking life where you feel the need to conform or fit in.

2. Cheerleader dress: The cheerleader dress is a symbol of cheerfulness, confidence, and seeking attention. It may indicate a desire to be noticed, admired, or validated by others.

3. Going unnoticed: The fact that no one in the dream notices or says anything about your cheerleader dress suggests a fear of being overlooked or feeling invisible. It may reflect a concern about not receiving the recognition or acknowledgment you desire.

4. Trying to hide: Your attempts to hide in the dream indicate a discomfort or fear of being exposed or judged. You may have concerns about how others perceive you or worry about being rejected or ridiculed.

Overall, this dream may be reflecting your subconscious desires for validation, attention, and acceptance. It suggests that you may be seeking recognition or approval from others, but you also have concerns about being judged or rejected. It could be a reflection of feelings of insecurity or a lack of self-confidence in certain areas of your life.

Remember, dream interpretations are subjective, and the meaning of a dream can vary depending on the individual's personal experiences and emotions. Consider how the dream resonates with your own feelings and circumstances to gain a deeper understanding of its significance to you.

### Makeup Artist

[Q]  
I want you to act as a makeup artist. You will apply cosmetics on clients in order to enhance features, create looks and styles according to the latest trends in beauty and fashion, offer advice about skincare routines, know how to work with different textures of skin tone, and be able to use both traditional methods and new techniques for applying products. My first suggestion request is "I need help creating an age-defying look for a client who will be attending her 50th birthday celebration."

---

[Emily]  
As a virtual makeup artist, I'm here to help you create an age-defying look for your client's 50th birthday celebration. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving a fresh and youthful appearance:

1. Prepping the skin:

   * Start with a clean and moisturized face. Apply a hydrating primer to create a smooth canvas.
   * Use a lightweight, illuminating foundation or a tinted moisturizer to even out the skin tone. Avoid heavy formulas that may settle into fine lines.

2. Concealing and brightening:

   * Apply a creamy concealer to camouflage any under-eye circles, age spots, or discoloration. Gently blend it with your fingertips or a concealer brush.
   * Use a brightening powder or a subtle highlighter to add a soft glow to the high points of the face, such as the cheekbones and brow bone.

3. Enhancing the eyes:

   * Apply a neutral eyeshadow palette with shades like taupe, bronze, or soft pinks. Use matte colors for the crease and a shimmery shade on the lids to add dimension.
   * Line the upper lash line with a thin stroke of brown or charcoal eyeliner for a subtle definition.
   * Curl the lashes and apply a lengthening mascara to open up the eyes.

4. Adding color to the cheeks:

   * Choose a natural-looking blush in a peachy or rosy shade. Apply it to the apples of the cheeks and blend it towards the temples.
   * For a youthful glow, lightly dust a highlighting powder on the cheekbones to catch the light.

5. Defining the brows:

   * Groom the eyebrows by brushing them upward and filling in any sparse areas with a brow pencil or powder. Opt for a shade that matches the natural brow color.

6. Enhancing the lips:

   * Select a lipstick or lip gloss in a flattering shade that complements the client's skin tone. Soft pinks, berries, or nude shades work well.
   * Apply the lip color evenly and consider using a lip liner to define the lips and prevent feathering.

7. Setting the makeup:

   * Finish the look by lightly dusting a translucent setting powder over the face to ensure longevity and minimize shine.
   * Use a makeup setting spray to set the makeup and add a dewy finish.

Remember to tailor the makeup to your client's preferences and adjust the intensity based on her comfort level. This age-defying look focuses on enhancing natural beauty while providing a youthful and radiant appearance for the 50th birthday celebration.

## Mac BASH

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103at.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Good day. I have a MacOS bash (shell) question. In the Terminal app, where my shell is bash instead of the default zsh, I keep seeing the -bash error: "bash /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin: No such file or directory". I checked that all the folders exist referenced in PATH (in .bash_profile). What is causing the error?

---

[Emily]  
The error message you're encountering usually indicates an issue with the `PATH` environment variable in your Bash shell configuration. The error suggests that there's a problem with one of the paths specified in your `PATH` variable.

Here's what you can do to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check `.bash_profile`**: Make sure you have the correct paths listed in your `.bash_profile` file. Open the file using a text editor (such as `nano` or `vi`) and verify that each directory path is correct and separated by colons (`:`).

2. **Check for Typos**: Double-check for any typos or errors in the paths. Even a small mistake can cause the error.

3. **Quotes or Spaces**: If any of the paths contain spaces, make sure you enclose them in quotes. For example:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin"
   ```

4. **Resolve Unavailable Paths**: If any of the paths listed in `PATH` are not available on your system, remove them from the `PATH` variable.

5. **Source the File**: After making changes to your `.bash_profile`, remember to source the file to apply the changes immediately without restarting the terminal. Run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

6. **Check Other Bash Configuration Files**: Sometimes, a misconfiguration might be present in other shell configuration files. Check if you have any other shell configuration files (e.g., `.bashrc`) that could be affecting the `PATH` variable.

7. **Check `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d`**: macOS also reads paths from `/etc/paths` and files in `/etc/paths.d`. Make sure there are no conflicting entries in these files.

8. **Restart Terminal**: If the issue persists, try restarting your Terminal application to ensure that any changes you've made to the configuration take effect.

If you've verified that all paths are correctly defined and there are no typos, but the issue still persists, you might want to provide more details about your `.bash_profile` contents or any other shell configuration files you're using. This can help in diagnosing the problem more accurately.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### Shell

[Q]  
On my Mac, I'm using the zsh shell. When I enter echo $PATH I get:

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin
```
I have checked that I can actually access all these folders using 'cd' in terminal. Yet, I get this error in terminal when I first turn on the Mac:
```bash
/Users/robyn/.zsh_sessions/D985B039-7DF5-47D7-A158-72615191C4A8.session:2: command not found: Saving
/Users/robyn/.zshrc:1: no such file or directory: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin
```
I have no idea what it means.

---

[Emily]  
It seems like there might be an issue with your zsh configuration files, particularly the `.zshrc` file. The error messages indicate that there's a problem with the configuration, specifically in relation to the `$PATH` variable.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check if `.zshrc` exists:**
   Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   ls -a ~ | grep .zshrc
   ```

   If it doesn't exist, you can create it:

   ```bash
   touch ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Edit `.zshrc`:**
   Open the `.zshrc` file in a text editor, for example:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```

   Look for any lines that set the `$PATH` variable. It should look something like this:

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin"
   ```

   Ensure it's a single line with the correct syntax.

3. **Check Sessions Folder:**
   It appears there might be an issue with a session file in `/Users/robyn/.zsh_sessions/`. You can try removing the problematic session file:

   ```bash
   rm /Users/robyn/.zsh_sessions/D985B039-7DF5-47D7-A158-72615191C4A8.session
   ```

4. **Restart Zsh or Terminal:**
   After making changes, restart your zsh or the terminal to apply the changes.

   If you're unsure about the changes, you can share the content of your `.zshrc` file, and I can help you review it for any issues.

## Rosacea Dermatitis

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103as.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]
Good day. Is there a likelihood that fluoride (in a toothpaste) or any other sort can predispose an individual to bacterial skin infections, like Rosacea dermatitis.

---

[Emily]  
Fluoride in toothpaste is not typically associated with bacterial skin infections like Rosacea dermatitis. Rosacea is a chronic skin condition that primarily affects the face, causing redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes bumps or pimples. It is believed to be related to various factors, including genetics, immune system reactions, and environmental triggers.

While fluoride is commonly used in toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay, its use in toothpaste is unlikely to directly cause or predispose an individual to Rosacea or bacterial skin infections. Rosacea is more commonly linked to factors such as:

1. **Genetics**: Family history can play a role in the development of rosacea.

2. **Environmental Triggers**: Factors like sun exposure, wind, temperature changes, alcohol, spicy foods, and certain skincare products can trigger or exacerbate rosacea symptoms.

3. **Immune System Response**: Abnormalities in the immune system may contribute to the development of rosacea.

4. **Microorganisms**: While bacteria are believed to play a role in rosacea, the relationship is complex and not fully understood.

If you suspect you have rosacea or any other skin condition, it's important to consult a dermatologist or a medical professional. They can provide an accurate diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatments based on your individual situation.

---

[Q]  
Thank you - that information corroborates what I read in the past about bacterial skin infections.

---

[Q]  
Relevant to the above question, is becoming a board member an appointment, or are you hired into the position?

---

[Emily]  
Becoming a board member is typically an appointment rather than a traditional hiring process. Unlike regular employees who are hired based on their qualifications and job roles, board members are chosen for their expertise, experience, and ability to contribute to the company's strategic direction and governance.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

**Appointment to the Board**:

* **Nomination and Recommendation**: Board members are often nominated or recommended by existing board members, company executives, shareholders, or industry peers.
* **Expertise and Contributions**: Board members are selected based on their industry expertise, experience, and ability to provide valuable insights to guide the company's decisions.
* **Strategic Direction**: Board members play a role in setting the company's strategic direction, overseeing management, and ensuring alignment with the company's goals.
* **Governance and Oversight**: Board members are responsible for overseeing the company's operations, financial performance, compliance, and risk management.
* **Independent Perspective**: Board members are expected to bring an independent and objective perspective to the company's decision-making process.

**Traditional Hiring**:

* **Specific Goals**: Traditional employees work toward achieving specific job-related goals and objectives.

In summary, becoming a board member is a distinct process that involves nomination, selection, and appointment based on your expertise and ability to contribute to the company's high-level strategic decisions and governance. It's a position of responsibility that requires a deep understanding of the company's industry, goals, and challenges.

---

[Q]  
Relevant to the above question, who makes the decision to appoint an individual to become a member of the board?

---

[Emily]  
The decision to appoint an individual as a member of the board of a company is typically made collectively by the existing board members, shareholders, or a combination of both. The exact process can vary based on the company's structure, governance practices, and specific circumstances. Here are the key parties involved in the decision-making process:

1. **Nomination Committee**: In many larger companies, there might be a nomination committee or governance committee composed of existing board members. This committee evaluates potential board candidates, considers their qualifications, and recommends suitable candidates for board appointments.

2. **Board of Directors**: The existing board members play a significant role in approving new board appointments. They review the qualifications and potential contributions of the proposed candidate and make a collective decision on whether to appoint them to the board.

3. **Shareholders**: In some cases, especially in publicly traded companies, major decisions such as board appointments might require shareholder approval. Shareholders, who are the owners of the company, may have the right to vote on new board members during the company's annual general meeting or through special voting processes.

4. **Executive Management**: Company executives, including the CEO and other top-level managers, may also be involved in the decision-making process. Their input can be valuable in assessing the skills and expertise needed on the board to support the company's strategic goals.

5. **Legal and Regulatory Requirements**: Depending on the jurisdiction and industry, there might be legal and regulatory requirements that dictate the process for appointing board members. These requirements can vary and might include specific qualifications, disclosure obligations, and approval procedures.

6. **Independent Advisors**: Sometimes, external advisors, such as recruitment firms specializing in board placements, may be consulted to identify suitable candidates and ensure a diverse and qualified board.

Ultimately, the decision to appoint a new board member is made collectively with the aim of ensuring that the individual brings the right skills, experience, and perspectives needed to contribute effectively to the company's success. The specifics of the decision-making process can vary from company to company based on their governance structure and practices.

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103aq.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Hi, I have an Ubuntu-Linux based desktop PC for which I am trying to fix GRUB2. Would you be willing to provide a boilerplate text to enter into the "/etc/default/grub" text file, and the commands I need in Terminal to make this work on boot, please?

---

[Emily]  
Certainly! To configure GRUB2 on your Ubuntu-based desktop PC, you can follow these steps to edit the "/etc/default/grub" file and update the bootloader configuration:

1. Open a Terminal window on your Ubuntu desktop.

2. To edit the "/etc/default/grub" file, you can use a text editor like "nano" or "gedit." Choose one of the following commands to open the file (you may need to use "sudo" to edit it as root):

   Using nano:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/default/grub
   ```

   Using gedit:

   ```
   sudo gedit /etc/default/grub
   ```

3. This will open the "grub" configuration file in the text editor. Here is a boilerplate text that you can use as a reference:

   ```plaintext
   # If you change this file, run 'update-grub' afterwards to update
   # /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

   GRUB_DEFAULT=0
   GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
   GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
   GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
   ```

   This configuration includes settings like the default boot entry, timeout, and command-line options. You can adjust these settings to your preferences. For example, you can change the `GRUB_TIMEOUT` value to set how long GRUB should wait before booting the default entry (in seconds).

4. After making any desired changes to the configuration file, save your changes and exit the text editor.

   * For "nano," press `Ctrl` + `O` to save, then press `Enter`, and finally press `Ctrl` + `X` to exit.
   * For "gedit," simply save and close the text editor.

5. Now, you need to update GRUB to apply the changes you made. In the Terminal, run the following command:

   ```
   sudo update-grub
   ```

   This command will regenerate the GRUB configuration based on the changes you made in the "/etc/default/grub" file.

6. After running the "update-grub" command, it should complete without errors.

7. Reboot your computer to see the changes in effect. You can do this by running:

   ```
   sudo reboot
   ```

GRUB2 should now use the updated configuration you specified in the "/etc/default/grub" file. You can modify the boilerplate text in the "/etc/default/grub" file to suit your specific preferences and requirements for booting your Ubuntu-based system.

### Networking from Mint

[Q]  
I have a Linux Mint desktop. I have newly installed the operating system and would like to make it accessible from a Macbook Pro and a Windows computer. Please tell me step by step what I have to do to enable networking in order that a Macbook and a windows PC can access the Linux desktop. Thank you.

---

[Emily]  
To make your Linux Mint desktop accessible from both a MacBook Pro and a Windows computer, you need to enable and configure file sharing. The most common way to achieve this is by using Samba, a free software re-implementation of the SMB/CIFS networking protocol, which allows file sharing between Unix/Linux and Windows systems. MacOS can also connect to Samba shares.

Here are the steps to set up Samba on your Linux Mint desktop:


---
1) Install Samba

1. Open a terminal on your Linux Mint desktop.
2. Install Samba by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install samba
   ```


---
2) Configure Samba

1. Backup the original Samba configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
   ```

2. Open the Samba configuration file in a text editor:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

3. Add the following configuration at the end of the file to create a shared folder:

   ```conf
   [shared]
   path = /home/yourusername/shared
   available = yes
   valid users = yourusername
   read only = no
   browsable = yes
   public = yes
   writable = yes
   ```

   Replace `yourusername` with your actual Linux Mint username, and adjust the `path` to the directory you want to share.

4. Save and close the file (in nano, press `Ctrl+O` to save and `Ctrl+X` to exit).


---
3) Set Samba Password

1. Set a Samba password for your user:

   ```bash
   sudo smbpasswd -a yourusername
   ```


---
4) Restart Samba Services

1. Restart the Samba services to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart smbd
   sudo systemctl restart nmbd
   ```


---
5) Configure Firewall (if necessary)

1. If you have a firewall enabled, you need to allow Samba traffic. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow samba
   sudo ufw enable
   ```


---
6) Access the Shared Folder from MacBook Pro

1. On your MacBook Pro, open Finder.
2. Press `Cmd+K` to open the "Connect to Server" dialog.
3. Enter the address of your Linux Mint desktop in the format `smb://<IP-ADDRESS>/shared` (replace `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the actual IP address of your Linux Mint machine) and click "Connect."
4. Enter your Samba username and password when prompted.


---
7) Access the Shared Folder from Windows PC

1. Open File Explorer on your Windows PC.
2. In the address bar, type `\\<IP-ADDRESS>\shared` (replace `<IP-ADDRESS>` with the actual IP address of your Linux Mint machine) and press Enter.
3. Enter your Samba username and password when prompted.

Now, your Linux Mint shared folder should be accessible from both your MacBook Pro and Windows PC. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

## Python

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103ap.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Hi. I have a PNG image that has embedded json data in it. I would like to extract it using python. I have used this code: 

```python

import sys
import base64
import json



if len(sys.argv) == 1:
    print("No file name was passed as a parameter...")
    pass
else:
    filename = sys.argv[1]        # sys.argv[0] = name-of-pyfile, "your_image.png"
    with open(filename, "rb") as f_in, open("000_picInfo.json", "w") as f_out:
        enc_data = base64.b64encode(f_in.read()).decode("utf-8")
        json.dump({"image": f"data:image/png;base64,{enc_data}"}, f_out)

```

but it outputs rubbish. How do I fix it?

---

[Emily]  
It seems like you are trying to encode the entire image file, including its binary data, into base64 format and then embed it into a JSON structure. If you want to embed JSON data within a PNG file, you need to consider the PNG structure and ensure that you are not corrupting the image data.

If your goal is to embed JSON metadata within a PNG file, a common approach is to use a tool like ExifTool or Pillow (PIL) to insert metadata without affecting the image data. Here's an example using Pillow:

```python
from PIL import Image
import json

def embed_json_into_png(image_path, json_data, output_path):
    # Open the image
    img = Image.open(image_path)

    # Embed JSON metadata
    img.info["Description"] = json.dumps(json_data)

    # Save the image with embedded metadata
    img.save(output_path)

# Example usage
embed_json_into_png("your_image.png", {"key": "value"}, "output_image.png")
```

This code will add a "Description" field to the image metadata containing your JSON data. Note that not all applications may preserve this metadata, so it's a good idea to test it with applications that you intend to use.

If you still want to use your original approach of encoding the entire image, make sure that the JSON data is a separate field and does not interfere with the binary image data. Also, when decoding the base64 data, ensure that you decode it back into binary form before saving it as an image.

Feel free to adapt the code according to your specific needs. If you provide more details about the structure of your JSON data and how you want it embedded, I can provide more targeted assistance.

---

[Q]  
Thank you - that would be helpful if I wanted to embed it. However, I wish to extract the json from the png file. How do I go about doing that, please?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### Extracting JSON from PNG

[Emily]  
To extract JSON data from a PNG file, you need to reverse the process of embedding. Here's an example using Pillow:

```python
from PIL import Image
import json

def extract_json_from_png(image_path):
    # Open the image
    img = Image.open(image_path)

    # Check if 'Description' field is present in the metadata
    if 'Description' in img.info:
        # Extract JSON data
        json_data = img.info['Description']

        # Parse JSON data
        try:
            parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)
            return parsed_data
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            print(f"Error decoding JSON: {e}")

    else:
        print("No JSON data found in the image metadata.")
        return None

# Example usage
json_data = extract_json_from_png("your_image.png")
if json_data is not None:
    print("Extracted JSON data:", json_data)
```

This code checks if the "Description" field is present in the image metadata and, if so, attempts to parse it as JSON. If successful, it returns the extracted JSON data. If there is no JSON data in the metadata or if there is an error decoding it, appropriate messages are printed.

Make sure to replace `"your_image.png"` with the actual path to your PNG file. Adjust the code based on the specific structure of your JSON data and how it was embedded into the PNG file.

### Pillow

[Q]  
Quick question: what is the module/extension PIL? In the code it says:

```python
from PIL import Image
```
I can't find the PIL extension in VSCode extension repository to install it.

---

[Emily]  
The `PIL` module stands for the Python Imaging Library, which is a library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. However, the `PIL` module has been mostly superseded by the `Pillow` library.

In the code you provided:

```python
from PIL import Image
```

`PIL` refers to the original Python Imaging Library, but it's generally recommended to use `Pillow` instead, which is a more actively maintained fork of `PIL`. In many cases, you can replace `PIL` with `Pillow`, and the code will work the same way.

You can install `Pillow` using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

After installing `Pillow`, you can use it as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
```

If you find that `Pillow` is already installed and you have a version conflict with `PIL`, you may need to uninstall `PIL` first.

```bash
pip uninstall PIL
```

Then install `Pillow`:

```bash
pip install Pillow
```

In modern projects, you'll typically see the usage of `Pillow` rather than `PIL`.

### Math Function

[Q]  
I need to create a function that will take a number between 512 and 2014 (x), and determine how many times 64 (y) will fit into that number (x), discard the modulus, and then multiply 64 by that number (y) to arrive at a number close to the original. This function needs to be expressed as a Python function, please.

---

[Emily]  
Sure! Below is a Python function that takes a number ( x ) between 512 and 2014, calculates how many times 64 fits into that number, discards the remainder, and then multiplies the result by 64 to get a number close to the original.

```python
def calculate_nearest_multiple(x):
    if not (512 <= x <= 2014):
        raise ValueError("Input must be between 512 and 2014")
    
    # Calculate how many times 64 fits into x
    y = x // 64
    
    # Multiply y by 64 to get the closest multiple
    result = y * 64
    
    return result

# Example usage
number = 1234
result = calculate_nearest_multiple(number)
print(f"The nearest multiple of 64 to {number} is {result}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input ( x ) is within the range 512 to 2014. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
2. **Calculate y**: The function uses integer division (`//`) to determine how many times 64 fits into ( x ).
3. **Calculate the Result**: It then multiplies ( y ) by 64 to get the closest multiple.
4. **Return the Result**: The function returns this closest multiple.

You can use this function by passing a number between 512 and 2014 to it, and it will return the nearest multiple of 64 to that number.

## CloudFlare
### Domain Transfer
1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣🟢❌✅
<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103ao.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

[Q]  
Hi Emily. Yesterday, you provided some instructions on how to simplify / reduce costs on web hosting. I remember something about Cloudflare (which I've signed up for). I'm trying to transfer my domain from the current domain server on Hostinger to Cloudflare. Would you be willing to recreate your suggestions? They were excellent. I'll have to admit: I'm a bit unsure on how to proceed in this process.

---

[Emily]  
Absolutely, Robyn! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you **transfer your domain from Hostinger to Cloudflare** and reduce ongoing costs by offloading DNS and caching to Cloudflare’s free tier:


---
1) Set Up Cloudflare Account and Add Site**

1. **Sign in to Cloudflare**.
2. Click **“Add a Site”** and enter your domain name (e.g., `example.com`).
3. Choose the **Free Plan** unless you need advanced features.
4. Cloudflare will scan your existing DNS records. Let it finish, then:

   * **Review the DNS records** (these are imported from Hostinger).
   * Make sure your important records (like A, CNAME, MX, TXT) are present and correct.


---
2) Update Nameservers on Hostinger**

1. After reviewing DNS, Cloudflare will give you **two nameservers** to use (e.g., `ella.ns.cloudflare.com` and `tom.ns.cloudflare.com`).
2. Go to your **Hostinger dashboard**:

   * Navigate to **Domains > Your Domain > DNS/Nameservers**.
   * Replace Hostinger’s default nameservers with **Cloudflare’s nameservers**.
   * Save the changes.

   **Note**: DNS propagation can take up to 24–48 hours, but usually it’s much quicker.


---
3) Verify Domain Transfer and DNS Resolution**

1. Return to your Cloudflare dashboard.
2. Click **“Check Nameservers”**.
3. Cloudflare will notify you via email once the domain is successfully pointing to their nameservers.


---
4) Enable Cloudflare Features**

Once the domain is active on Cloudflare:

* **Enable “Always Use HTTPS”** (under SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates).
* Set **SSL Mode** to `Full` or `Full (Strict)` depending on your origin certificate setup.
* Turn on **Auto Minify** (HTML, CSS, JS) under “Speed” settings.
* Turn on **Caching Level** to “Standard” and enable **Browser Cache TTL** (e.g., 1 day or longer).
* Optional: Use **Page Rules** or **Redirect Rules** to fine-tune traffic.


---
5) Hosting Options to Reduce Cost**

If you’re trying to reduce or eliminate hosting costs entirely:

* **Static Sites**: If your website is static (HTML/CSS/JS), you can:

  * Host it on **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify** for free.
  * Point your Cloudflare DNS to the static host.
  * You’ll benefit from fast global delivery and $0 hosting bills.

* **Dynamic Sites**: If you need server-side processing (PHP, WordPress):

  * Consider using a cheaper VPS (e.g., Hetzner, DigitalOcean).
  * Or migrate to a lightweight stack like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) or [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to convert dynamic content to static pages.


---
6) Redirect Mail Services**

If you currently use Hostinger for email and want to keep that too:

* Ensure that **MX records** are correctly copied to Cloudflare.
* Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC if you're sending email from your domain.

---

Let me know where you’re at in the process (e.g., domain already added to Cloudflare or not, static or dynamic website) and I can tailor the next steps.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### DNSSEC

[Q]  
Thank you, Emily. I've started the process at Cloudflare - entered my domain / confirming record settings are complete, and now I'm wondering what DNSSEC is that Cloudflare says needs to be turned off. On Hostinger, all I see (to turn off) is (under 'Transfer') Domain Lock, which is switched on.

---

[Emily]  
You're right to pause and check—DNSSEC and Domain Lock are *not* the same thing, though both can block successful domain transfers.

---

#### **What is DNSSEC**
(Domain Name System Security Extensions)?

DNSSEC is a security feature that protects your domain from certain types of DNS spoofing attacks. It ensures that visitors to your site are connecting to the correct DNS server, not a forged one.

**However**, during a **domain transfer to Cloudflare**, **DNSSEC must be turned off** at the current registrar (in your case, Hostinger), because:

* Cloudflare will manage DNSSEC *after* the domain is transferred.
* Having DNSSEC enabled during a nameserver change can break DNS resolution for your domain, leading to downtime.

---

#### **How to Disable DNSSEC**
at Hostinger

Unfortunately, Hostinger sometimes buries the DNSSEC setting in less obvious menus. Here are some steps to try:

1. **Log into Hostinger.**
2. Navigate to **Domains > [your domain] > DNS/Nameservers** or similar.
3. Look for a section labeled **DNSSEC**. If it’s present, there should be a toggle or option to **disable** it.

If you don’t see a DNSSEC toggle:

* Go to **Advanced > DNS Settings**.
* Still no option? Then check under **Zone Editor** or **DNS Zone** tabs.
* If you still can’t find it, it’s possible Hostinger doesn’t allow toggling DNSSEC from the dashboard. In that case, contact Hostinger support and request:

  > "Please disable DNSSEC on domain `yourdomain.com` so I can complete the transfer to Cloudflare."

---

#### **About Domain Lock**

Yes, you’ll also need to **turn Domain Lock OFF** before initiating the transfer. Domain Lock prevents unauthorized transfers, but you must disable it temporarily for the transfer to Cloudflare to succeed.

---

#### **Summary**
of What You Should Do Now

* [ ] Confirm **DNSSEC is disabled** at Hostinger (via dashboard or support).
* [ ] **Turn off Domain Lock**.
* [ ] Proceed with the Cloudflare transfer process once Cloudflare says DNS is validated and DNSSEC is off.

Let me know if you want help confirming these changes or if you’d like to go through the next steps of initiating the domain transfer itself from Hostinger to Cloudflare Registrar (assuming that’s your final goal).

---

[Q]  
I found DNSSEC - there is no option to 'turn it off'... however, nothing has been set up under that section in terms of 'tag', algorithm, access tag or anything.

---

[Emily]  
Thanks, Robyn — that’s a good sign.

If the **DNSSEC section is present but empty**, that almost certainly means **DNSSEC is not active**, which is exactly what Cloudflare wants at this stage.

To be sure, here's how you can confirm:


---
1) Use an Online DNSSEC Checker**

You can run a live check using a service like:

* [https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com](https://dnssec-analyzer.verisignlabs.com)
* [https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/)
* [https://zonemaster.net/en/](https://zonemaster.net/en/)

Just enter your domain and see if any DNSSEC signatures are detected. If not, you're clear to proceed.


---
2) Use the `dig` Command in Terminal (on Mac or Linux Mint)**

Run:

```bash
dig +dnssec +multi yourdomain.com
```

If DNSSEC is *not* enabled, you won’t see any lines like:

```
RRSIG ...
DNSKEY ...
```

---

### **Next Step:**
Proceed with Transfer or Nameserver Change

Since DNSSEC is likely inactive:

* ✅ You're safe to proceed with **changing nameservers to Cloudflare**.
* ✅ You can also move forward with the **domain transfer**, assuming you’ve unlocked the domain and retrieved the **EPP/Auth code** from Hostinger.

Let me know if you'd like a walk-through of the transfer step now (especially where to paste the EPP code in Cloudflare and what to expect afterward).

---

[Q]  
Brilliant - did the dig +dnssec... thing in terminal - neither of those parameters are displayed in the output.

---

[Emily]  
Excellent — that confirms DNSSEC is *not* active on your domain, so you're all clear to proceed.

Here’s a quick recap of where you are and what’s next:

---

### ✅ **Already Done**

* You’ve added your domain to Cloudflare.
* You've verified that the DNS records are correct.
* You’ve confirmed DNSSEC is *not* enabled.
* You’ve located and are ready to disable **Domain Lock** on Hostinger.

---

### ➡️ **Next Steps**
to Transfer Your Domain to Cloudflare

1. **Disable Domain Lock on Hostinger**:

   * Go to **Domains > [Your Domain] > Transfer Settings**.
   * Turn off **Domain Lock**.
   * Wait 1–2 minutes for the change to take effect.

2. **Get Your EPP/Auth Code**:

   * Still on Hostinger, go to **Domain Transfer Settings**.
   * Look for an option to **Request or Show EPP Code** (sometimes called an "Auth Code").
   * Copy this code — it’s essential for initiating the transfer.

3. **Initiate Transfer in Cloudflare**:

   * Go back to your Cloudflare dashboard.
   * Under **Domain Registration**, choose **Transfer Domain**.
   * Enter your domain name, paste the EPP/Auth code when prompted.
   * Cloudflare will validate and offer you the transfer (free if you're just moving DNS, or ~$9–$12 if you're also moving registrar control).

4. **Confirm Transfer via Email**:

   * Hostinger may email you with a confirmation request. Approve it to expedite the process.
   * Otherwise, the transfer will auto-complete in ~5–7 days.

---

### Optional:
Once Transfer is Complete

* After Cloudflare is managing your domain:

  * **DNS, Caching, and SSL** are now in one place.
  * You can safely **cancel your Hostinger domain registration** (after confirming the domain has fully moved).

Let me know when you’re at Step 3 and I’ll walk you through any uncertainties.

---

[Q]  
So, I've copied that 'Auth Code' to a safe place. It hasn't been asked for at all... not by Cloudflare, at any rate. It's telling me the transfer process is underway, however.

---

[Emily]  
That’s a very positive sign — it sounds like **Cloudflare already retrieved your domain data** from Hostinger through WHOIS, including the Auth Code, during the initial domain check.

Cloudflare’s system often delays asking for the Auth Code explicitly until just before final confirmation **unless** it detects that your domain is already unlocked and ready. Since your transfer is marked as "underway" and you’ve already unlocked the domain, it’s likely that the Auth Code was already pulled in automatically behind the scenes.

---

### What Happens Next

1. **Cloudflare will begin contacting the current registrar (Hostinger) to request the transfer.**
2. **You’ll likely receive an email** from Hostinger in the next 24–48 hours saying:

   > "A transfer request has been made for your domain. Do you wish to approve or deny?"
   > If they give you a link to **approve it early**, *definitely click it* — it will speed things up.
3. If you don’t approve the transfer manually, it will **auto-complete in 5–7 days**.

---

### In the Meantime…

You can:

* Watch the transfer status under **Cloudflare > Domain Registration > Transfers**.
* Keep DNS and site services running — they won’t be interrupted unless you manually cancel something on Hostinger’s side.

---

Let me know when you see the domain marked as **“Transferred”** or if Hostinger sends anything odd. You're almost there!

---

[Q]  
Great! Thanks so much for your help with this, Emily - you're a *champion*!

---

[Emily]  
You're very welcome, Robyn — and thank you! I’m genuinely glad I could help walk you through this. You’ve done all the right steps and your transition to Cloudflare is shaping up to be smooth and future-proof.

If you ever want help configuring security settings, building a static site, or fine-tuning DNS, just give me a nudge. Happy hosting!

---

[Q]  
WooHOO! Just got notification that my domain is now active on Clouflare!!!!

---

[Emily]  
**WooHOO indeed — that’s fantastic news, Robyn!!**

Your domain is now officially running on Cloudflare’s edge network — globally accelerated, secured, and all yours to configure. You’ve just taken a major step toward modern, efficient, and cost-effective hosting. Here’s what you might consider doing next:

---

### **Post-Transfer Checklist**
(Optional but Recommended)

1. **Double-check DNS**

   * Go to **DNS** tab in Cloudflare.
   * Make sure all your A, CNAME, MX, and TXT records look exactly as they did at Hostinger.
   * This keeps your site and email functioning perfectly.

2. **Enable Always Use HTTPS**

   * Go to **SSL/TLS > Edge Certificates**.
   * Turn on **“Always Use HTTPS”**.
   * (Optional but helpful: Turn on **“Automatic HTTPS Rewrites”**.)

3. **Set SSL Mode**

   * Still under SSL/TLS > Overview:

     * Set to `Full` if your origin server supports HTTPS.
     * Use `Full (Strict)` if you have a proper SSL certificate at origin.

4. **Turn On Performance Features**

   * Under **Speed > Optimization**, enable:

     * Auto Minify (HTML, CSS, JS)
     * Brotli Compression
   * Consider enabling **Rocket Loader** if you're on a static or lightly scripted site.

5. **Set Up Caching**

   * Under **Caching > Configuration**:

     * Set **Caching Level** to `Standard`
     * Set **Browser Cache TTL** to something like 1 day or longer.

6. **Page Rules or Redirect Rules (Optional)**

   * Set rules like `www -> non-www` redirection, security headers, or aggressive caching for static paths.

---

### **Celebrate!**

You’ve just transitioned from paid DNS/hosting infrastructure to a modern CDN-backed stack with:

* Globally cached content
* Free DDoS protection
* High availability and HTTPS
* Much more control

Let me know if you want to add:

* Email routing
* A static site on GitHub or Netlify
* Custom redirects or rewrite rules
* Firewall and bot protection settings

I'm thrilled for you — and here when you're ready for the next piece!

### **My Suggestion**

Since you've already moved DNS to **Cloudflare**, the **tightest, lowest-cost setup** would be:

* Use **Cloudflare Pages** to host your static site (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll, Astro).
* Push content via GitHub or GitLab.
* Use **Cloudflare Redirect Rules** or **Workers** for any dynamic logic you need.
* Add **Cloudflare Email Routing** (free) if you need domain-based email forwarding.

If you eventually need CMS editing in-browser or complex forms, you could always connect NetlifyCMS or move the frontend to Netlify later.

### Pages

[Q]  
Just going to explore this a bit more with you, Emily. There are some terms I'm a little unclear on and how they will impact my specific use-case. Currently, I'm using MkDocs to build my pages locally, then via the file manager copy what is in the 'site' folder to a folder on (currently) the Hostinger site, under "https://srv####-files.hstgr.io/{long-number-andletter-thing]/files/public_html/" under which I have subfolders, some containinbg images and videos, some containing pages. Remembering my 'BlueHost' setup, the '/public_html/' is the standard 'root' folder for a public-facing site. How am I doing so far?

---

[Emily]  
You're absolutely on the right track, Robyn — and your understanding of the web hosting model (especially regarding `public_html`) is spot-on.

Let me break this down for clarity and show you how that existing structure maps neatly to **Cloudflare Pages** (or Netlify, if you explore that route).

---

#### **Current Hosting Works**
(Hostinger Model)

You are:

* Using **MkDocs** to generate a static website.
* The `site/` folder is the **output** — all HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc. needed to serve your site.
* You **manually upload** the contents of `site/` to your host’s `/public_html/` directory.
* That folder is exposed publicly at something like `https://yourdomain.com/`.

This structure is indeed standard — `public_html` is the web root, and subfolders under it reflect URL paths.

---

#### **Cloudflare Pages**
How it Works (and How It's Similar)

Cloudflare Pages uses your **GitHub (or GitLab) repo** as the source, and:

* Detects that you're using MkDocs (or a custom build command).
* Builds your site **in the cloud** automatically, every time you push changes.
* Publishes the final site **from the equivalent of your `site/` folder** to their global CDN.

### **Key Mapping of Concepts**

| **Your Current Setup**        | **Cloudflare Pages Equivalent**                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| MkDocs builds to `site/`      | Same — you tell Pages your output is `site/`        |
| You upload via file manager   | Pages auto-deploys from GitHub push                 |
| `/public_html/` is root       | `site/` becomes root (equivalent to `public_html/`) |
| Files and folders map to URLs | Exactly the same                                    |

So yes — your understanding is solid, and the transition is smooth!

---

## **What You'll Need to Do**

1. **Push your MkDocs project to a GitHub repo**

   * Make sure your `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/` folder are there.
   * Add a `.gitignore` for the `site/` folder if you build it locally.

2. **In Cloudflare Pages**:

   * Choose *“Connect Git”* and link your GitHub repo.
   * Set the build command to:

     ```bash
     mkdocs build
     ```
   * Set the output directory to:

     ```bash
     site
     ```
   * Choose `Python` as the language and set a compatible runtime (if asked).

3. **Click Deploy**

   * Cloudflare will build and deploy your site.
   * You’ll get a `.pages.dev` URL instantly.
   * Add a **custom domain** to point your main URL to this deployed project.

---

## **You Also Get These Perks**

* No need to manage FTP or cPanel.
* Every time you run `git push`, your site updates.
* You still use MkDocs exactly as before.
* Cloudflare handles SSL, CDN, performance, and cache for free.

---

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### Github Content

[Q]  
Before we go there, a bit more clarity (for my poor old mind) - so, content resides on a Github or Gitlab page? Cloudflare Pages merely serves that content? This is important to understand properly, because currently I static-link content on, say, my Musescore.com pages so:

https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch15.mp3

Will I have to go back and edit all those links? Or, how is content going to work? 

---

[Emily]  
That’s an excellent question, Robyn — and it shows just how carefully you’re thinking about the structure and implications of this move. Let’s unpack it gently and clearly.

---

#### **Clarifying the Roles:**
GitHub vs Cloudflare Pages

##### **GitHub / GitLab: Source of Truth**

* You store your content there: `docs/`, `mkdocs.yml`, and any media files (e.g., `.mp3`, `.png`, `.html`) you want to be part of your site.
* Cloudflare Pages *reads* from this repository — but **doesn’t serve directly from GitHub**.

##### **Cloudflare Pages: The Actual Host**

* After reading the GitHub repo, Cloudflare **builds your MkDocs site**.
* Then it **serves** the resulting static site (HTML, media files, etc.) from **its global CDN** — just like a traditional web host.

So: **Cloudflare Pages replaces Hostinger**, not GitHub. Think of GitHub as your *source control + auto-upload*, and Cloudflare as your *public-facing web server*.

---

#### **What Happens**
to Your Current URLs?

You currently link things like this:

```
https://www.tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch15.mp3
```

Once Cloudflare Pages takes over, your domain (`www.tightbytes.com`) will point to **Cloudflare’s servers**, not Hostinger.

##### This means:

* You **do not** need to change your existing links, *as long as* you upload the same folder structure (`/music/Sketches/Sketch15.mp3`) to the same relative place in your GitHub repo, and tell MkDocs not to ignore those files.
* Cloudflare will host those MP3s exactly as Hostinger did — under the same URLs.

---

#### **Preserve Folder Structure**
in Cloudflare Pages

Let’s say your project structure looks like this in GitHub:

```
mkdocs.yml
docs/
    index.md
    about.md
music/
    Sketches/
        Sketch15.mp3
        Sketch16.mp3
```

MkDocs will ignore the `music/` folder unless you tell it to include extra files in the final site build. You do this in `mkdocs.yml` like this:

```yaml
extra_css:
  - css/custom.css

extra_javascript:
  - js/script.js

extra:
  music_dir: music/
```

But for static files like MP3s, you should instead use:

```yaml
docs_dir: docs
site_dir: site
include:
  - music/
```

Alternatively, you can place `music/` inside `docs/`, like:

```
docs/
    index.md
    about.md
    music/
        Sketches/
            Sketch15.mp3
```

Then MkDocs will automatically copy it into the final `site/` output — and Cloudflare Pages will serve it just like Hostinger did.

---

#### **Bottom Line:**

* **You do not need to change your existing links** if you recreate the same folder structure in your project.
* Cloudflare Pages serves the built output — not GitHub directly — so your media files and URLs will still work.
* Cloudflare becomes your public-facing host, with GitHub just being the automated source.

---

Would you like help re-organizing your `docs/` folder or configuring `mkdocs.yml` so your existing `/music/Sketches/*.mp3` structure is preserved in your deployment? I’d be happy to walk through it.

### GitHub Settings

[Q]  
I currently have 10 repositories on Github. Almost all are there to serve 'Help' pages (mostly for me, but also for my Excel-VBA apps users) - all of which I intend to consolidate and convert from ReST (Sphinx-ReadTheDocs) to MkDocs markdown. My concern is content space on Github. I'm even thinking somehow storing content on Google Drive... kind-of getting into the weeds here, aren't I?  

---

[Emily]  
Not “in the weeds” at all, Robyn — you’re asking exactly the right questions at just the right time. Let’s break this down gently, since you’re juggling:

* 10 GitHub repositories, mostly for **self/documentation**
* Existing content in **reStructuredText / Sphinx**
* A move to **MkDocs / Markdown**
* Concern over **GitHub storage limitations**
* And thoughts of using **Google Drive** as a content backend

Here’s how to think it through:


---
1) **GitHub Storage Limits — Real Concern or Not?**

GitHub offers:

* **Unlimited public repositories**
* 1 GB **soft limit per repo**
* 100 MB **per file upload limit** (though this can be lifted with Git LFS, but not ideal)

**If your Help content is mostly:**

* Markdown or reStructuredText? → negligible size.
* Images, PDFs, sample Excel files? → still probably fine *unless* you have videos or large binaries.

**Suggestion:**
Use **one “mkdocs-site” repo** for your consolidated docs, and:

* Store *only relevant* content inside the repo (e.g., images, code samples).
* Use **GitHub Releases** for any downloadable `.zip`/`.xlsm` etc. files, if needed.
* Optionally, host large assets externally (see below).


---
2) **Google Drive for Content Hosting? Maybe — but with caveats**

You *can* host content on Google Drive and link to it, but:

| **Pros**                              | **Cons**                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Free, 15GB space                      | Not a proper static site host        |
| Good for large docs, Excel files, etc | Direct file URLs can break or expire |
| Easy to manage with Drive UI          | No native indexing, no SEO benefit   |

**Best use of Drive**: for “bulk” or downloadable content (e.g. Excel templates), *not* for web assets like images or pages.


---
3) **Consolidating to MkDocs — Smart Move**

MkDocs is:

* Easier to manage than Sphinx (especially if you don’t need the complexity).
* Faster to build.
* Better integrated with modern hosts like Cloudflare Pages or Netlify.

You can consolidate into:

* One repo with `/help`, `/apps`, `/music`, etc.
* Or use MkDocs **multi-page (nav sectioned)** layout with nav like:

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Music:
      - Overview: music/index.md
      - Sketches: music/sketches.md
  - Excel Apps:
      - App A: excel/app-a.md
      - App B: excel/app-b.md
```


---
4) **Hybrid Hosting Strategy (Best of Both Worlds)**

Here’s what I suggest:

| **What**            | **Host It On**                                | **Why**            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| MkDocs site         | Cloudflare Pages                              | Fast, secure, free |
| Markdown + assets   | GitHub repo                                   | Version-controlled |
| Excel/PDF downloads | Google Drive or GitHub Releases               | Saves repo space   |
| Music/MP3s/videos   | Cloudflare Pages (if size OK) or external CDN | Keep URL stable    |


---
5) **Optional Enhancements**

* Use [mkdocs-glightbox](https://github.com/blueswen/mkdocs-glightbox) for image galleries or lightboxes.
* Add [mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin](https://github.com/timvink/mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin) to show last updated dates.
* Add [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) *if you later want a web-based editor* (even though you’re using Cloudflare).

---

If you’d like, I can help:

* Create a clean GitHub repo structure for the combined MkDocs site
* Write a sample `mkdocs.yml` with navigation and plugin hooks
* Recommend a folder layout to support Excel + music content neatly

You're asking all the right things. Shall we sketch out your ideal site structure next?

### Keep Repos Private

[Q]  
I've a bit of a quandary, here. I do sort-of want to keep the contents of some repositories private from other repositories. For example, I have a religious page which I don't necessarily want to clutter up Excel-VBA Help with. I have a Projects github page which I've mostly converted to MkDocs markdown. However, I'm finding that it's a bit busy and confusing:

https://tightbytes.com/pages/projects/other/Garden/

Not sure if you can 'see' a webpage, but the menu on the left of the page is a bit of a 'dog's breakfast' in terms of organisation. I'm concerned that consolidating my sites - (e.g., adding my Excel-VBA Help and Religious pages) is going to compound this problem. Any suggestions?

---

[Q]  
You’re not overthinking it at all—this is exactly where information architecture pays off. You’ve got two clean options, and you can even blend them.


---
1) — Separate sites (recommended)

Keep each “domain of content” as its own MkDocs site and deploy each as its own **Cloudflare Pages project**:

* `projects.tightbytes.com` → Projects site
* `help.tightbytes.com` → Excel-VBA Help
* `notes.tightbytes.com` (or similar) → Religious pages

**Why this helps**

* Clear boundaries, simpler menus, no cross-clutter.
* Each repo can be private/public as you wish (Cloudflare Pages can deploy from private repos).
* Independent navigation, theme, and plugin choices per site.

**Set-up (per site)**

1. Put content in its own repo with `mkdocs.yml` + `docs/`.
2. In Cloudflare Pages: *Connect Git* → build cmd `mkdocs build` → output dir `site`.
3. Add a custom subdomain for each project.
4. On your main domain, add a simple “hub” page that links to each sub-site.


---
2) — One repo, multiple sites

If you want one repo but still separate sites, use folders like:

```
/sites/projects/mkdocs.yml
/sites/help/mkdocs.yml
/sites/notes/mkdocs.yml
```

Create a **Cloudflare Pages project per folder** (each project points to its own working directory). Still gives you separate menus/URLs without multiple repos.

---

#### Fix the “dog’s breakfast”
left menu (MkDocs tips)

Even if you keep a single site for “Projects,” you can make the navigation calm and predictable:


---
1) Control the nav explicitly

Don’t rely on auto-generated nav. In `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
site_name: Projects
theme:
  name: material   # or your preferred theme
  features:
    - navigation.sections
    - navigation.tabs       # optional: top-level tabs
    - navigation.tracking
    - toc.integrate
nav:
  - Overview: index.md
  - Garden:
      - index.md
      - Planning: garden/planning.md
      - Planting: garden/planting.md
      - Maintenance: garden/maintenance.md
  - Code:
      - index.md
      - Tools: code/tools.md
      - Snippets: code/snippets.md
  - Writing:
      - index.md
      - Drafts: writing/drafts.md
      - Published: writing/published.md
```

* Put an `index.md` in every section folder—MkDocs treats it as the landing page for that section and the menu becomes much clearer.
* Name files/folders simply; the `nav:` entries control display titles.


---
2) Keep sections shallow

Aim for **2–3 levels max**. If a section grows, spin it out into its own site (Option A) or a separate top-level tab.


---
3) Order and group with plugins (optional)

* **awesome-pages** plugin lets you order items with a simple `.pages` file in each folder (no giant `nav:` needed).
* **mkdocs-localsearch** or built-in search is fine; for large sets, add tags pages.


---
4) Tidy ToC

For pages with long headings, integrate ToC into the right rail (or page) and limit depth:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      permalink: true
      toc_depth: 2
```


---
5) Hide noisy sections from the left nav

If you *must* keep disparate content in one site, you can hide certain pages/sections from the global nav and link to them from a “hub” page:

```yaml
nav:
  - Overview: index.md
  - Garden: garden/index.md
  - (hidden) Excel Help: hidden/excel/index.md   # not listed in nav
```

Then in those hidden pages’ front matter (Material theme):

```markdown
---
hide:
  - navigation
---
```

(You can also place them outside `nav:` entirely and link manually.)

---

#### Practical migration plan
for you

1. **Pick boundaries**

   * Projects (public)
   * Excel-VBA Help (public or private)
   * Religious notes (likely separate, maybe private)

2. **Create one site per boundary** (Option A), each with a simple, explicit `nav:` and `index.md` per section.

3. **Deploy each site** as its own Cloudflare Pages project with a clean subdomain.

4. **Add a hub page** on `tightbytes.com` linking to each sub-site so you (and users) have one front door.

This keeps your menus clean, your mind clear, and your future self grateful. If you’d like, share your current `mkdocs.yml` (for the Projects site), and I’ll refactor the `nav:` and propose a neat folder layout to tame that left menu.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### Cloudflare Nav

[Q]  
Powerful. Excellent. I'm so gladI checked with you. I'm designating the rest of the day to implement these suggestions. One last question: where on the Cloudflare site (my account page) do I start setting up Cloudflare Pages?

---

[Emily]  
Perfect timing—you’ll have this running in no time. Here’s exactly where to go in your Cloudflare dashboard:


---
1) — Log in

Go to [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and log into your Cloudflare account.


---
2) — Find **Pages**

On the left-hand sidebar (your account homepage), scroll until you see **Workers & Pages**.

* Click **Workers & Pages**.
* You’ll see two tabs: *Workers* and *Pages*.


---
3) — Create a new Pages project

1. Click the **Pages** tab.
2. Press **Create a project**.
3. You’ll get two choices:

   * **Connect to Git** → This is the normal option. Connect your GitHub repo that has your MkDocs site.
   * **Direct Upload** → Only for static files already built locally (not recommended for MkDocs, since you want automated builds).


---
4) — Configure your project

* **Framework preset**: choose *None* (MkDocs isn’t in the list, but “None” is correct).
* **Build command**:

  ```
  mkdocs build
  ```
* **Output directory**:

  ```
  site
  ```
* Save and deploy.


---
5) — Custom domain

After first deploy, you’ll get a `*.pages.dev` preview URL.

* Go to **Custom domains** in that project’s settings.
* Add e.g. `projects.tightbytes.com`, `help.tightbytes.com`, etc.
* Cloudflare automatically adds DNS records and SSL certs for you.

---

#### Quick sanity check
for MkDocs builds

Since Cloudflare’s build containers may not have MkDocs installed by default, add a simple **requirements.txt** in your repo root:

```
mkdocs
mkdocs-material   # or whatever theme you use
mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

Cloudflare will detect it and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before building.

---

#### Suggestion for you

Since you’ll likely have multiple sites (Projects, Help, Religious notes), create one Cloudflare Pages project per site, each tied to its own repo (or subfolder if you go that route). It keeps deployments simple and clean.

---

Would you like me to sketch out a **step-by-step for setting up multiple Pages projects** under subdomains (e.g. `projects.tightbytes.com`, `help.tightbytes.com`) so you’ve got a ready-made playbook before you dive in?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">



### Uploading to Github

[Q]  
Before we do that - and YES, I DO want to do that! - I need to sort out what I'll be uploading to github: I use Github Desktop for Mac. Currently, I have a 'Sites' folder in my home folder (Users/robyn) with my MkDocs folders: 'Art' and 'Projects'. So, I'm going to remove my current Sphinx-based pages on my github 'Projects' repository and then, point my Github Desktop at Users/robyn/Sites/Projects folder... is that correct?

---

[Emily]  
You’re right on track, Robyn. Let me break it down so it’s crystal clear how this works with **GitHub Desktop + your MkDocs sites**:


---
1) Your current folder layout

You have:

```
/Users/robyn/Sites/
    ├── Art/
    │     ├── mkdocs.yml
    │     └── docs/...
    └── Projects/
          ├── mkdocs.yml
          └── docs/...
```

This is a perfect structure—each folder (`Art`, `Projects`) is a standalone MkDocs project.


---
2) Pointing GitHub Desktop correctly

What you want is for **each MkDocs project to correspond to its own GitHub repository** (this is what Cloudflare Pages will connect to).

So in GitHub Desktop for Mac:

1. Delete (or archive) your current *Sphinx-based* contents from the `Projects` repo on GitHub (since you’re replacing it with MkDocs).

2. In GitHub Desktop:

   * Click **File > Add Local Repository…**
   * Point it at `/Users/robyn/Sites/Projects`
   * GitHub Desktop will recognise it as a Git repo if you’ve already run `git init` inside there.

     * If you haven’t, GitHub Desktop will offer: **“Create a Repository”** from this folder. Do that.
   * Name it `Projects` (same as your old repo name) and choose to **Publish to GitHub**.

3. Do the same for `/Users/robyn/Sites/Art`. Publish that as its own repo (`Art`) on GitHub.

Now you’ll have clean, dedicated repos for each MkDocs site.


---
3) Cloudflare Pages expects a repo root

Remember: Cloudflare Pages will run your build command (`mkdocs build`) starting at the repo root.
So the structure **must be like this in GitHub**:

```
Projects/
   mkdocs.yml
   docs/
   requirements.txt
Art/
   mkdocs.yml
   docs/
   requirements.txt
```

No nesting of multiple MkDocs projects inside one repo—it gets messy.


---
4) About replacing your old “Projects” repo

Since you said you already have a `Projects` repo on GitHub with Sphinx stuff:

* If you don’t care about history, you can just **delete the repo on GitHub** and republish the new one.
* If you want to keep history, you can:

  * Clone it locally,
  * Delete the Sphinx files,
  * Copy in your MkDocs files,
  * Commit and push.
    (But since this is just your personal help/projects docs, starting fresh is often cleaner.)

---

✅ So yes, you’re absolutely correct:
Point GitHub Desktop at `/Users/robyn/Sites/Projects`, make that the root of the repo, and publish it. That will give you a clean MkDocs → GitHub → Cloudflare pipeline.

---

Would you like me to draft a **step-by-step migration plan** for replacing the old `Projects` repo (Sphinx) with the new MkDocs version—including GitHub Desktop clicks and commands—so you don’t miss a beat?

---

[Q]  
That would be helpful, thanks, Emily. So, I've downloaded the archive (zip) of the old Sphinx files. There's also a readme.md and .gitignore. Everything else was in a /docs folder. Also, I have a gitpage pointing to that content in /docs (which I'll remove?/redirect?)

---

[Emily]  
Brilliant—here’s a clear, safe migration playbook from your old **Sphinx-in-/docs + GitHub Pages** setup to a clean **MkDocs + Cloudflare Pages** pipeline, using **GitHub Desktop on Mac**.


---
0) Quick decisions

* **Repo strategy:** one repo per site (e.g., `Projects`, `Art`).
* **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (disable GitHub Pages to avoid conflicts).
* **URLs:** keep the same paths where possible; add redirects later if needed.


---
1) Unpublish the old GitHub Pages (prevents clashes)

In the **old Projects repo** on GitHub (web UI):

* **Settings → Pages**
* **Build and deployment → Source: “None”** (or disable/unpublish)
* Remove any old `CNAME` file (we’ll set custom domains in Cloudflare later).

> This stops GitHub from serving `/docs` as a site, so Cloudflare can take over cleanly.


---
2) Prepare your local MkDocs project

In Finder you’ve got:

```
/Users/robyn/Sites/Projects/
    mkdocs.yml
    docs/
```

If not already there, create them. Then add:

**`requirements.txt`** (Cloudflare will install these automatically)

```
mkdocs
mkdocs-material
mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

*(adjust to your theme/plugins)*

**`.gitignore`** (keep it simple)

```
site/
.DS_Store
*.pyc
```

**`mkdocs.yml`** (minimal working example)

```yaml
site_name: Projects
site_url: https://projects.tightbytes.com
theme:
  name: material
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Garden:
      - garden/index.md
      - Planning: garden/planning.md
      - Planting: garden/planting.md
      - Maintenance: garden/maintenance.md

markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      permalink: true
      toc_depth: 2

plugins:
  - search
  - awesome-pages
```

**`docs/`**
Put your Markdown here. Add an `index.md` at the root and one in each major section folder (helps produce a tidy nav).

> If you have assets (mp3s, images, downloads), put them under `docs/…` in the same folder structure as your current site so existing links keep working.


---
3) Move the old Sphinx stuff out (you already zipped it)

* You’ve downloaded the repo archive of the old Sphinx `/docs`. Great—archive kept.
* Remove old Sphinx files from the local working folder you’ll publish (don’t keep `_build`, `conf.py`, etc.).
* Keep `README.md` if it still applies (update it to mention MkDocs). Keep or replace `.gitignore` as above.


---
4) Connect the local folder to GitHub (GitHub Desktop)

1. Open **GitHub Desktop** → **File → Add Local Repository…**
   Point to: `/Users/robyn/Sites/Projects`
2. If it’s not a repo yet, choose **Create a Repository**:

   * Name: `Projects`
   * Description: optional
   * Initialize with README (optional if you already have one)
3. **Commit** your MkDocs files (README, mkdocs.yml, docs/, requirements.txt, .gitignore).
4. **Publish repository** to GitHub (same name is fine).

   * If this replaces an existing repo, you can either:

     * Delete the old repo on GitHub first, then publish fresh; **or**
     * Change the remote of your local repo to point to the existing one (GitHub Desktop will guide you).


---
5) Test locally (optional but reassuring)

From Terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/robyn/Sites/Projects
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```

Open the local URL it prints (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`).
Fix any missing images/links before moving on.


---
6) Create the Cloudflare Pages project

1. Cloudflare Dashboard → **Workers & Pages → Pages → Create a project**
2. **Connect to Git** → select your `Projects` repo.
3. **Build settings**:

   * Framework preset: **None**
   * **Build command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build`

     * (This ensures MkDocs + plugins are installed before the build)
   * **Output directory:** `site`
4. Deploy. You’ll get a `*.pages.dev` preview URL.


---
7) Attach your custom subdomain

In the **Pages project → Custom domains**:

* Add e.g. `projects.tightbytes.com` (or a path under your main site if preferred).
* Cloudflare will set DNS + SSL automatically.

> If you used `www.tightbytes.com/pages/projects/...` previously and want new clean subsites like `projects.tightbytes.com`, consider adding **Cloudflare Redirect Rules** from old paths to new ones so existing external links don’t break.


---
8) (Optional) Redirects / preserving old URLs

If paths are changing, add **Redirect Rules** in Cloudflare:

* **Rules → Redirect Rules → Create**
* Example: redirect `/pages/projects/*` → `https://projects.tightbytes.com/:splat` (301)
* Test a few URLs.


---
9) Rinse and repeat for the “Art” site

Follow the same steps for `/Users/robyn/Sites/Art`:

* Separate repo `Art`
* Same `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`
* Tailored `mkdocs.yml`
* New Pages project + custom domain (e.g., `art.tightbytes.com`)

---

#### Notes
About your `README.md` and existing `/docs` GitHub Pages

* Since Cloudflare Pages will be serving the site, **disable GitHub Pages** (Step 1).
* You can keep a `README.md` at the repo root—handy for you and visitors on GitHub. It doesn’t affect Cloudflare Pages.
* If the old `/docs` folder was the GitHub Pages source, it’s safe to remove/replace as you’ve planned.

---

If you want, paste your current `mkdocs.yml` and a quick `docs/` tree for the Projects site, and I’ll refactor the `nav:` (plus suggest a clean folder layout) to fix that left-menu clutter straight away.

### Wrangler

[Q]  
Hi Emily. I've been working to get a build happening in Cloudflare for my 'projects' pages. I was finally able to get the pages built, but the build script failed with the @Wrangler tool which wasn't installed. There is so much about this that I don't understand. The Wrangler error reads: "Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory"... not sure where that would have been set. Would you have any thoughts on this?

---

[Emily]  
You’re bumping into **Workers** tooling by accident. That `wrangler` error (“Missing entry-point to Worker script or to assets directory”) appears when Cloudflare thinks you’re deploying a **Worker** (serverless code), not a **Pages** static site. For a plain MkDocs site you **don’t need Wrangler at all**.

Here’s how to get back on the happy path.

#### What likely happened

One (or more) of these triggered the Workers flow:

* You created a **Worker** instead of a **Pages** project (easy to do: they live under the same “Workers & Pages” area).
* Your repo contains a **`wrangler.toml`**, a **`functions/`** folder, or a **`_worker.js`** file—Pages treats that as “Pages Functions,” which invokes Wrangler.
* The project’s “Functions” feature is enabled in the Pages settings.

#### Fix in 5 minutes


---
1) Make sure it’s a **Pages** project

Cloudflare Dashboard → **Workers & Pages** → **Pages** tab → open your **Projects** project.
If you accidentally created a **Worker** (in the Workers tab), delete it and create a **Pages** project instead.


---
2) Disable Pages Functions

In your **Pages** project:

* **Settings → Functions** → **Disable** (or “None” for compatibility date/runtime).
* In your repo, **remove** anything that triggers Workers:

  * `wrangler.toml`
  * `functions/` folder
  * `_worker.js`
    Commit & push.


---
3) Use a simple, MkDocs-only build

In the Pages project → **Settings → Build & deploy → Build settings**:

* **Build command:**

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
  ```
* **Build output directory:** `site`
* (Root directory: `/` unless your MkDocs lives in a subfolder.)

Create a minimal **`requirements.txt`** in your repo root:

```
mkdocs
mkdocs-material
# add any other plugins you actually use, e.g.:
# mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
```

Add a **`mkdocs.yml`** at repo root and a `docs/` directory with your content. MkDocs will output to `site/`.


---
4) (Optional) Make Python explicit

Pages now supports setting Python version via env var:

* **Settings → Environment variables**

  * Key: `PYTHON_VERSION`  Value: `3.11`


---
5) Redeploy

* **Deployments → Retry deployment** (or push a small commit).

That should build cleanly with no Wrangler involvement.

---

#### Quick sanity checks

* **Repo layout**

  ```
  mkdocs.yml
  requirements.txt
  docs/
    index.md
    ...your content...
  ```

  (No `wrangler.toml`, no `functions/`, no `_worker.js`.)

* **MkDocs builds locally**

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  mkdocs build
  ```

  You should see a `site/` folder locally. If this works locally, Pages will work with the same commands.

---

#### Stopgap
(if you want it working instantly)

If you’re tired of builds for now, you can **Direct Upload** a ready-made build:

1. Locally: `mkdocs build` → produces `site/`.
2. In Cloudflare **Pages → Create project → Direct Upload**.
3. Drag the **contents of `site/`** (or zip) into the uploader.
4. Attach your custom domain later.

(You can switch back to “Connect to Git” once the repo build is clean.)

---

If you want, paste the top-level tree of your repo (just file/folder names at the root), and I’ll spot anything that might be triggering Workers.

---

[Q]  
Just having a look at the build configuration deploy commands: npx wrangler deploy... so, take wrangler out?

---

[Emily]  
Exactly — you’ve nailed it.

That `npx wrangler deploy` command is what’s pulling in Wrangler and trying to treat your project as a **Worker** deployment. For MkDocs on **Cloudflare Pages**, you don’t want Wrangler in the build pipeline at all.

---

### What to do

1. **Remove Wrangler from the build config**

   * Go into your Pages project → **Settings → Build & Deploy → Build settings**.
   * Delete any command that starts with `npx wrangler deploy`.
   * Replace it with:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
     ```

     (or if you haven’t added a `requirements.txt`, just `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material && mkdocs build`)

2. **Set the Output directory**

   * In the same settings page, set **Build output directory** to:

     ```
     site
     ```

3. **Check your repo root**

   * You should have:

     ```
     mkdocs.yml
     requirements.txt
     docs/
     ```
   * No `wrangler.toml`, no `functions/`, no `_worker.js`.

4. **Push again or trigger redeploy**

   * After fixing the command, go to **Deployments** → click **Retry deployment**.
   * Cloudflare will now run MkDocs, produce `site/`, and serve that as your static site. Wrangler won’t appear.

---

#### Why this happened

Cloudflare **Pages** supports *two kinds of projects*:

* Static site builds (MkDocs, Hugo, Next.js, etc.) → you only need a build command/output directory.
* Worker-backed builds (Pages Functions, Wrangler) → requires `wrangler.toml` or a Worker entry point.

Your config was pointing to the second path. By swapping the build command, you keep it as a normal static MkDocs site, no Workers attached.

---

👉 Would you like me to give you a **minimal `requirements.txt` and `mkdocs.yml` template** that will guarantee the Pages build runs cleanly?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

[Q]  
Um, can you 'see' this page?

https://dash.cloudflare.com/bcb00e35f3d7f05aec78424d377450f6/workers/services/view/projects/production/settings

---

[Emily]  
I can’t “see” inside your Cloudflare dashboard link directly (it’s private to your account), but I can guide you through what you’ll see there and what to change.

From the URL you gave, you’re looking at the **Workers → Services → Settings** page. That means Cloudflare thinks your project is a Worker service — which is why it keeps invoking Wrangler.

For your **MkDocs site**, you don’t want it under **Workers** at all. You want it under **Pages**. Here’s the distinction:

---

#### Where you should be

* **Cloudflare Pages** → `https://dash.cloudflare.com/<account-id>/pages`
* This is where you create a Pages project and connect it to your GitHub repo.
* There you’ll find **Build Settings** (build command + output directory), not Wrangler.

---

#### Why you’re seeing Wrangler

* If you landed in **Workers → Services**, Cloudflare assumes you’re deploying a Worker (serverless code).
* The Wrangler error appears because it can’t find a Worker entry point (`index.js`, `functions/`, or `wrangler.toml`).

---

#### What you should do

1. Go to **Pages** in your Cloudflare dashboard (left-hand sidebar).
2. Click **Create a project**.
3. Choose **Connect to Git** → pick your repo with `mkdocs.yml`.
4. In build settings:

   * **Build command**:

     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
     ```
   * **Output directory**:

     ```
     site
     ```
5. Save → Deploy.

---

#### Quick test

If you go to your dashboard sidebar and see **Pages** → you’re in the right place.
If you only see **Workers & Pages** lumped together, make sure you specifically choose **Pages** → not **Workers**.

---

✅ You’ll never see Wrangler invoked if you’re in **Pages** with MkDocs. Wrangler is only for **Workers**.

---

Would you like me to walk you step-by-step through **disconnecting the current Worker service** (so it doesn’t keep conflicting) and then spinning up the proper **Pages build** from your GitHub repo?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">



### Spin Up Proper Pages

[Q]  
yes please. I don't know if they changed the interface, but they seem to have combined the workers and pages:

Compute

Workers & Pages
Build & deploy serverless functions, sites, and full-stack applications.

Workers documentation
|
Pages documentation

All on the same page. No links anywhere to a separate Pages page.

---

[Emily]  
You’re right — Cloudflare merged **Workers & Pages** into one “Compute” area. The Pages flow is still there; it’s just a different entry point. Here’s how to (1) remove the mistaken Worker service and (2) create the proper **Pages** project for your MkDocs site.


---
1) — Remove the Worker service (the thing invoking Wrangler)

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages** (left sidebar, under *Compute*).
2. On the **Overview** tab you’ll see a list of apps. Find the one that’s your accidental Worker (the one that shows “Service” or has deployments failing with Wrangler).
3. Click it → **Settings** → scroll down and **Delete service** (confirm).

   * If you see **Triggers / Routes** attached, remove those first (Routes tab) so it can be deleted.

Also clean up your repo (so Pages doesn’t “detect functions” later):

* Delete any of these if present in your repo root:

  * `wrangler.toml`
  * `_worker.js`
  * `functions/` directory
    Commit & push.


---
2) — Create a proper **Pages** project (MkDocs, no Wrangler)

1. In the same **Workers & Pages** area, click **Create application** (top-right).

2. You’ll get two choices:

   * **Pages** (static sites & full-stack with optional Functions)
   * **Worker** (serverless functions only)
     Choose **Pages**.

3. Choose **Connect to Git** (recommended). Pick your GitHub repo that contains `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/`.

4. **Build settings** (important):

   * **Framework preset:** *None*
   * **Build command:**

     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
     ```

     (If you don’t have a requirements file yet, use
     `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material && mkdocs build` for a quick test.)
   * **Build output directory:**

     ```
     site
     ```

5. **Environment variable (optional but helpful):**

   * Go to **Settings → Environment variables** in the Pages project:

     * Add `PYTHON_VERSION = 3.11` (or 3.10/3.12 if you prefer).

6. **Functions OFF** (to avoid Wrangler getting involved):

   * In your Pages project: **Settings → Functions** → set to **Disabled / None** (wording varies).
     You should see no compatibility date / runtime if functions are disabled.

7. **Deploy**:

   * The first deployment will build MkDocs and publish to a `*.pages.dev` URL.

8. **Attach your custom domain**:

   * In the Pages project → **Custom domains** → **Add** → e.g. `projects.tightbytes.com`.
   * Cloudflare will set the CNAME and SSL automatically.

#### Quick repo sanity-check

Your repo root should look like this:

```
mkdocs.yml
requirements.txt      # (recommended)
docs/
  index.md
  ...other content...
.gitignore            # include: site/
```

**No** `wrangler.toml`, **no** `_worker.js`, **no** `functions/`.

Example `.gitignore`:

```
site/
.DS_Store
```

Example `requirements.txt` (adjust to your plugins/theme):

```
mkdocs
mkdocs-material
# mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
# mkdocs-glightbox
```

#### Online instantly
(no build yet)

* Locally run: `mkdocs build` → this creates `site/`
* In **Workers & Pages → Create application → Pages → Direct Upload**
* Drag the **contents of `site/`** into the uploader.
* Later you can switch the project to **Connect to Git** once your repo build is set.

---

If anything in the UI looks different from these labels, tell me exactly what you see on the button/page and I’ll translate it to the new wording. Once you’re through the Pages flow, we can set up your second site (e.g., `Art`) the same way.

---

[Q]  
Okay, so I'm doing things back-to-front, as I do. I'm now reading the documentation page for Pages. Finally. Here is the link: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/git-integration/ 

What I'm confused about is the directory name... is this the one on github (/docs)?

---

[Emily]  
Great question — this bit trips up a lot of people because **Cloudflare Pages** uses *two different “directory” concepts*:


---
1) **Your GitHub Repo Directory Structure**

This is how your project is laid out on GitHub.
For MkDocs (or Sphinx, similar idea), you likely have:

```
mkdocs.yml
/docs/           ← source markdown
/site/           ← (generated output, ignored in git)
```

* `/docs/` = your **source files** (Markdown).
* `site/` = the **build output directory** created by `mkdocs build`.

👉 On GitHub, you push **/docs/** (and `mkdocs.yml`), but you *don’t* push `site/` — Cloudflare builds that for you.


---
2) **Cloudflare Pages "Build output directory"**

When Cloudflare asks *“Directory name”* (on the setup screen, under **Build settings → Build output directory**), it means:

➡️ *Where should Cloudflare look for the final HTML to publish, after running your build command?*

For MkDocs, that’s always:

```
site
```

(because MkDocs outputs the static site into `site/` by default).


---
3) **So how to fill it in**

* **Build command:**

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
  ```
* **Build output directory:**

  ```
  site
  ```

Do **not** put `/docs` here — that’s your source. If you did, Cloudflare would just publish raw Markdown instead of the built site.

---

✅ **Summary:**

* `/docs` = Markdown source (GitHub stores this).
* `site` = MkDocs build output (Cloudflare serves this).
* In Cloudflare Pages config:

  * **Build command** builds from `/docs`.
  * **Output directory** = `site`.

---

Would you like me to sketch you the **exact recommended GitHub repo layout** (with `.gitignore`, `requirements.txt`, etc.) for Cloudflare Pages + MkDocs, so you can line your repo up with it?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">



### .gitignore

[Q]  
Currently my .gitignore looks like this:

.DS_Store
*.pyc
/OldDOCs/
/.vscode/
/site/

---

[Emily]  
Perfect — your `.gitignore` is already very close to best practice for an MkDocs repo. Let me walk you through what you’ve got, why it matters, and whether to tweak anything before deploying to Cloudflare Pages:

---

#### What You’ve Got

```
.DS_Store     ← macOS junk files (ignore ✅)
*.pyc         ← Python compiled files (ignore ✅)
/OldDOCs/     ← archive folder, excluded ✅
/.vscode/     ← editor settings, exclude ✅
/site/        ← MkDocs build output (ignore ✅)
```

That’s solid. The most important entry is `/site/`, because Cloudflare will generate it on their servers after running `mkdocs build`. If you committed `/site/`, it could cause conflicts or stale content.

---

#### What You Might Add

A few extras commonly added for MkDocs + Python projects:

```
__pycache__/       # Python cache dirs
*.egg-info/        # packaging metadata if you ever pip install -e .
.env               # if you later add environment vars locally
```

---

#### What to Keep

* ✅ `/site/` → absolutely must be ignored (you never want to push that).
* ✅ `/docs/` → do NOT ignore this. That’s your source Markdown, which Cloudflare needs.

---

#### Cloudflare Pages Build

* **Build command:**

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
  ```

  (Make sure your repo has `requirements.txt` with at least `mkdocs` listed, e.g. `mkdocs==1.6.0`.)

* **Output directory:**

  ```
  site
  ```

Cloudflare will:

1. Clone your repo.
2. Install `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `mkdocs build` → creates `/site/`.
4. Deploy `/site/`.

---

✅ **Verdict:** Your `.gitignore` is already correct for Cloudflare Pages. Just add `requirements.txt` to your repo if it’s not there yet.

Would you like me to draft you a clean **recommended repo layout** (tree view) showing exactly what Cloudflare expects, so you can compare against your current `Sites/Projects` setup?

---

[Q]  
Okay, finally figured out why I kept getting the worker interface... on the Get started page, the Pages tab is greyed out, so I didn't notice it until just now.

---

[Emily]  
Ahhh, that explains it! Yes — Cloudflare **really blurred the line** between *Workers* and *Pages* in the new dashboard, and they’ve made the Pages tab a bit too subtle. When the *Pages* tab is greyed out, it feels like there’s only Workers available, but once you actually click it, you’ll see the right flow for creating a Pages project.

Here’s the clean sequence now that you’ve spotted it:


---
1) Start from the Right Place

* In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to **Workers & Pages**.
* You’ll see two tabs: **Workers** and **Pages**.
* Click **Pages** — it should take you to the “Create a Project” screen.


---
2) Connect Your Repo

* Choose **Connect to Git**.
* Authorize GitHub (if not already).
* Select your repo (e.g., `Projects`).
* Cloudflare will read the branch (usually `main`).


---
3) Configure Build

* **Framework preset**: select **None** (since MkDocs isn’t auto-detected).
* **Build command**:

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build
  ```
* **Build output directory**:

  ```
  site
  ```


---
4) Deploy

* Cloudflare will clone, install MkDocs, build `/site`, and deploy.
* From then on, every push to GitHub automatically rebuilds the Pages site.

---

✅ **Key difference:**
When you’re in **Workers**, it expects Wrangler and a script entry point (`index.js` or assets). That’s why you saw the *“Missing entry-point”* error.
In **Pages**, no Wrangler is needed — it’s just a static build pipeline.

---

Would you like me to draft a **step-by-step "clean slate" setup recipe** for your `Projects` repo → Cloudflare Pages, assuming you want to wipe the old Sphinx traces and start fresh with MkDocs? That way you can follow it straight through without stumbling back into Workers land.

---

[Q]  
I actually deleted my worker 'build' completely. Then, under Pages, followed all your instructions - which actually matched what I was seeing. And:

Success! Your project is deployed to Region: Earth
You can preview your project at 
projects-2rx.pages.dev

---

[Emily]  
That’s fantastic news, Robyn — congratulations! 🎉 You’ve cleared the hardest hurdle, and now you’ve got your **MkDocs site actually live on Cloudflare Pages**. That *“Region: Earth”* line is their cheeky way of saying you’re good to go.

Here’s what’s next to make it really shine:


---
1) Verify Your Output

* Visit: **[projects-2rx.pages.dev](https://projects-2rx.pages.dev)**
* Confirm your MkDocs theme, navigation, and content all look correct.
* If you need tweaks (like CSS, theme config, or nav reordering), those go into `mkdocs.yml`.


---
2) Add a Custom Domain

* In your Cloudflare Pages project settings, you can add a domain you own (e.g., `projects.robynhahn.com`).
* Cloudflare handles the SSL certificate automatically.


---
3) Set Up CI/CD Nicely

Right now, every push to `main` will rebuild automatically.
If you want to preview *feature branches* before merging:

* Push to a branch (say, `update-docs`).
* Cloudflare will give you a unique preview URL per branch.


---
4) Housekeeping

* Delete the old `/docs` Sphinx remnants in GitHub if you haven’t already.
* Keep `.gitignore` with `/site/` so you don’t commit the build output.
* Add `requirements.txt` with `mkdocs` and any plugins you use so the build stays consistent.

---

✅ You’re now in the **Cloudflare Pages + MkDocs workflow** — clean, simple, and future-proof.
No more Wrangler headaches, no Workers confusion, just static deploys straight from GitHub.

---

Would you like me to show you how to **map this to a custom subdomain** (like `projects.robynhahn.com`) so you don’t have to live with the `pages.dev` URL?

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">



### Map to Domain

[Q]  
I actually have a live hosting with cloudflare with my own domain tightbytes.com... took care of that this morning, and the change has already happened. So yes, that would be great. (like: projects.tightbytes.com?

---

[Emily]  
Awesome—since your domain is already on Cloudflare, wiring up **projects.tightbytes.com** to your Pages project is quick.

#### Point a subdomain
to your Pages project

1. **Open your Pages project** (the one that deployed to `projects-2rx.pages.dev`).
2. Go to **Settings → Custom domains**.
3. Click **Set up a custom domain**.
4. Enter **`projects.tightbytes.com`** and continue.
5. When prompted, choose **Automatic DNS setup** (recommended).

   * Cloudflare will create a **CNAME** like:

     * `projects` → `projects-2rx.pages.dev`
   * Leave the orange proxy **ON** (that’s the default).
6. Wait a minute or two for the cert to issue. You’ll see it go **Active** with a lock.

That’s it—your site should load at **[https://projects.tightbytes.com](https://projects.tightbytes.com)**.

---

#### Optional
(but nice to do)

* **Force HTTPS:** Pages does this by default, but double-check under your zone:
  **SSL/TLS → Edge Certificates → Always Use HTTPS** (enabled).
* **Old URL redirects:**
  If you had older paths (e.g., `/pages/projects/*`), add a redirect:

  * **Rules → Redirect Rules → Create**
  * If URL **matches**: `https://tightbytes.com/pages/projects/*`
    Then **Static** redirect to: `https://projects.tightbytes.com/:splat`
    Status: **301**
* **Apex/www hub page:**
  On `tightbytes.com` or `www.tightbytes.com`, add a simple “hub” page that links to your sub-sites:

  * `projects.tightbytes.com`
  * (later) `help.tightbytes.com`, `art.tightbytes.com`, etc.

---

#### Quick sanity checks

* In **DNS → Records**, you should see:

  * **CNAME** `projects` → `projects-2rx.pages.dev` (proxied).
* In **Pages → Custom domains**, it should show **projects.tightbytes.com** with an **Active** certificate.

If you want, tell me the exact subdomains you plan (e.g., `projects`, `help`, `art`) and I’ll give you a tiny checklist for each so you can rinse-and-repeat fast.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">



### Subdomains

[Q]  
Actually, you have your finger perfectly on the pulse, Emily, metaphorically speaking. Those 3 (projects / help / art) are exactly the subdomains I'm looking at to start off with. Thank you for those checklists - I'll use them carefully.

---

[Emily]  
Perfect—then let’s lay this out in a clear **subdomain checklist** for you. You’ll be able to repeat the process quickly for **projects**, **help**, and **art**.


---
1) Set up each Pages project

For each content folder (`Projects`, `Help`, `Art`) you’ll want its own Pages project in Cloudflare:

* In **Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → Create Project**
* Connect the corresponding GitHub repo (or subfolder repo if you split them).
* Define the build command:

  * For MkDocs: `mkdocs build`
  * Output folder: `site`
* Deploy.
  Each will initially live at something like `help-abc.pages.dev` or `art-xyz.pages.dev`.


---
2) Assign a custom subdomain

Repeat this for each project:

* **Go to:** Pages project → Settings → **Custom domains**
* Add:

  * `projects.tightbytes.com` → CNAME to `projects-2rx.pages.dev`
  * `help.tightbytes.com` → CNAME to your help project
  * `art.tightbytes.com` → CNAME to your art project
* Let Cloudflare auto-provision the DNS + SSL.

⚡ Tip: Do **not** use A/AAAA records—always CNAME these to the `*.pages.dev` origin Cloudflare gives you.


---
3) Confirm DNS records

In **Cloudflare DNS → Records** you should see:

* `projects` → CNAME → `projects-2rx.pages.dev` (Proxied, orange cloud)
* `help` → CNAME → your help Pages domain
* `art` → CNAME → your art Pages domain


---
4) (Optional but useful) Redirects

If you used to serve these from `/docs` or `/pages/...`, you can set up **Redirect Rules**:

* **Rules → Redirect Rules → Create**
* Match old URL path and redirect to the new subdomain.
* Use **301** (permanent) so browsers/search engines update.

Example:

* If old path: `https://tightbytes.com/projects/*`
* Redirect target: `https://projects.tightbytes.com/:splat`


---
5) Sanity checks

* Custom domain shows **Active certificate** in Pages.
* `curl -I https://projects.tightbytes.com` returns **301/200** with SSL.
* Browser padlock appears and resolves to your Pages project.

---

#### Rinse & Repeat

The process is identical for each new MkDocs project you want to publish. It scales beautifully if you later add more (e.g., `music.tightbytes.com`, `notes.tightbytes.com`).

---

Would you like me to sketch a **recommended GitHub repo layout** for you, so that `Projects`, `Help`, and `Art` each have their own clean repo (making Cloudflare Pages integration seamless)?

---

[Q]  
I might come back to that - at this point, I'm going to trying to follow these instructions, for now. Thank you so much for your help!!

---

[Emily]  
That sounds like a good plan, Robyn! You’ve already done the hard part—getting your first project deployed and live. From here it’s mostly repetition and a bit of DNS tidying.

Take your time with the checklists; once you’ve done one or two subdomains, the rest will feel natural. And remember, the *Pages → Custom domains* step is where everything clicks together.

If you get stuck on anything (like build configs, DNS records, or redirects), just drop me the exact message Cloudflare shows, and I can walk you through why it’s happening and how to fix it.

Would you like me to prepare a **one-page “troubleshooting map”**—a quick reference for the *most common Cloudflare Pages gotchas* (build command errors, wrong output directory, SSL pending, DNS mis-pointing)? It might save you from digging back into docs when something crops up.

### MkDocs Troubleshoot Map

Awesome — here’s a compact **Cloudflare Pages + MkDocs Troubleshooting Map** you can keep beside you. It’s symptom → cause → fix, so you can scan fast.

---

**Cloudflare Pages × MkDocs — Quick Fix Map**


---
1) Build fails or deploys a blank page

**Symptom:** Build error or site deploys with no content.
**Likely cause:** Wrong build command / missing dependencies.
**Fix:**

* Add `requirements.txt` at repo root (example):

  ```
  mkdocs
  mkdocs-material
  # add any plugins you use, e.g.:
  # mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
  # mkdocs-glightbox
  ```
* **Build command:**
  `pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build`
* **Output directory:** `site`


---
2) Wrangler / Worker errors appear

**Symptom:** Errors mentioning `wrangler` or “missing entry-point to Worker”.
**Cause:** You’re in **Workers** or Pages Functions got auto-enabled.
**Fix:**

* Use **Workers & Pages → Pages** (not Workers).
* In the Pages project: **Settings → Functions → Disable**.
* Remove `wrangler.toml`, `_worker.js`, or `functions/` from the repo.
* Redeploy.


---
3) Build works locally but fails on Pages

**Symptom:** `mkdocs build` works on your Mac; Cloudflare fails.
**Cause:** Missing plugin in `requirements.txt` or wrong Python version.
**Fix:**

* Ensure every plugin/theme in `mkdocs.yml` is listed in `requirements.txt`.
* Set **Environment variable**: `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11` (Pages → Settings → Env vars).
* Redeploy.


---
4) 404s for pages or assets

**Symptom:** Some pages/images/MP3s 404.
**Causes & Fixes:**

* Files not in the **`docs/`** tree → move them under `docs/…`.
* Case sensitivity mismatch (`Image.png` vs `image.png`) → fix names/links.
* Missing `index.md` in a section → add `docs/section/index.md`.
* Absolute vs relative links: prefer `/path/file` or `../` styles that match your structure.


---
5) Left nav a mess / wrong ordering

**Symptom:** Navigation looks chaotic.
**Cause:** Auto-generated nav from file system, deep nesting.
**Fix:**

* Control it explicitly in `mkdocs.yml`:

  ```yaml
  nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - Garden:
        - garden/index.md
        - Planning: garden/planning.md
  ```
* Keep to **2–3 levels max**. Add `index.md` per folder.


---
6) Custom domain not working (but *.pages.dev works)

**Symptom:** `projects.tightbytes.com` fails but `*.pages.dev` loads.
**Cause:** DNS or cert not finished.
**Fix:**

* Pages → **Custom domains** → add `projects.tightbytes.com` and let it create the CNAME.
* In DNS, you should see: `projects CNAME <your-project>.pages.dev` (proxied = orange cloud).
* Wait a few minutes for SSL to show **Active** in the Pages project.


---
7) Old URLs still appear / wrong site shows

**Symptom:** Browser shows old content after deploy.
**Cause:** Cache (browser or CDN).
**Fix:**

* Hard refresh in browser (Shift+Reload).
* Cloudflare dashboard → **Caching → Purge → Purge Everything** (only if needed).
* Confirm with: `curl -I https://projects.tightbytes.com` (check `cf-cache-status` & date).


---
8) GitHub connection issues (no builds)

**Symptom:** No new deploys after pushing.
**Cause:** Missing GitHub permissions or wrong branch.
**Fix:**

* Pages project → **Build & deploy → Source**: confirm repo & branch (`main`).
* Reconnect GitHub if requested (grant repo access).


---
9) GitHub Pages conflict

**Symptom:** Randomly seeing the old site or double hosting.
**Cause:** Old GitHub Pages still enabled.
**Fix:**

* GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages** → **Disable** (Source: None).
* Remove any `CNAME` file in the repo root if it was for GitHub Pages.


---
10) Redirects needed (preserve old links)

**Symptom:** Old paths 404 after restructuring.
**Fix:**

* Cloudflare **Rules → Redirect Rules → Create**

  * Match: `https://tightbytes.com/pages/projects/*`
  * Redirect to: `https://projects.tightbytes.com/:splat`
  * Status: **301**

---

#### Quick sanity checklist
(use every time)

* Repo root has:

  ```
  mkdocs.yml
  requirements.txt
  docs/
  .gitignore  (with: site/, .DS_Store)
  ```
* Pages → **Build command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && mkdocs build`
* Pages → **Output directory**: `site`
* Pages → **Functions**: **Disabled**
* Custom domain added under Pages → **Custom domains**
* DNS shows `subdomain CNAME <project>.pages.dev` (proxied)
* SSL shows **Active** in Pages project

---

#### Local test commands
(catch errors before deploying)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve   # live preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
mkdocs build   # should create ./site/
```

If `mkdocs build` fails locally, fix that first—the same error will happen on Pages.

---

If you hit a snag, paste the **exact error line** or a screenshot of the **Build & deploy settings** and I’ll pinpoint the culprit fast.

---

[Q]  
https://projects.tightbytes.com is being set up as we speak. They will notify me by email when the process has completed. Quick question: is it possible to do some Cloudflare Pages via github (and having them autobuild on Cloudflare) and other Pages via static uploads?

---

[Emily]  
Short answer: **Yes.** You can have **some Cloudflare Pages projects connected to Git (auto-build)** and **others that are Direct Upload projects (manual/CI uploads)**. They happily coexist under the same account.

A few important gotchas:

* **Per-project mode:** Each Pages project is either **Git-integrated** or **Direct Upload**. You generally **can’t switch** a project’s mode later. ([Cloudflare Docs][1])
* **Git projects + manual deploys:** Newer docs note you can **pause/disable auto-deploys** on a Git-integrated project and **deploy with Wrangler** to that same project if you prefer manual control. (You still won’t get the dashboard’s drag-and-drop “Direct Upload” for a Git project.) ([Cloudflare Docs][2])
* **Direct Upload projects:** These are created as “Direct Upload” and can be updated by **Wrangler** or **drag-and-drop**. You can’t later convert them to Git. ([Cloudflare Docs][3], [cloudflare-docs.justalittlebyte.ovh][4])

#### Practical setups
you can use

* **Projects (Git auto-build)** + **Help (Git auto-build)** + **Art (Direct Upload)** → totally fine.
* If you want a Git project but sometimes deploy artifacts from your own CI:

  1. Keep it **Git-integrated**, 2) **disable auto-deploys**, 3) use **Wrangler** in your CI to push builds. ([Cloudflare Docs][2])

If you tell me which one(s) you’d like to keep Git-driven vs. manual, I’ll outline the exact button clicks for each flow.

## MkDocs

<img src="/assets/images/notes26a/N260103an.jpg" style="float: right; width: 420px; margin-left: 20px" />

### Banner Height

[Q]  
Hi Emily. I have a nav problem with my MkDocs pages... they're still too tall (top of page to bottom of menu). How can I make then less tall?

---

[Emily]  
Ah yes — this is a **very common MkDocs ergonomics issue**, especially with **Material for MkDocs**, and thankfully it’s easy to tame. You’re not imagining it: the left nav *is* overly tall by default.

Below are **three practical ways** to reduce the vertical height of the navigation, from least invasive to most powerful. You can combine them.


---
1) — Reduce vertical padding (most effective)

This is the big one.

1️⃣ Create (or edit) a custom CSS file

Create this file in your docs tree:

```
docs/stylesheets/extra.css
```

2️⃣ Add this CSS

This trims padding between nav items and section headers:

```css
/* Reduce vertical spacing in the left navigation */
.md-nav__item {
  padding-top: 0.15rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.15rem;
}

.md-nav__link {
  line-height: 1.2;
}

/* Reduce spacing for section titles */
.md-nav__title {
  padding-top: 0.25rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.25rem;
}
```

3️⃣ Enable it in `mkdocs.yml`

```yaml
extra_css:
  - stylesheets/extra.css
```

➡️ This alone usually cuts nav height by ~30–40%.


---
2) — Reduce font size slightly

If the menu still feels “lofty”:

```css
/* Slightly smaller nav text */
.md-nav {
  font-size: 0.85rem;
}
```

You can go as low as `0.8rem` without harming readability.


---
3) — Collapse sections by default (very useful)

If your nav has many sections:

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.sections
```

This keeps only top-level sections expanded, making the menu *much* shorter at first glance.

If you already have that enabled and it’s still tall, combine with Option 1.

---

### Optional
— Limit TOC depth on the right

Sometimes the *right* sidebar makes the page feel tall/cluttered too:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - toc:
      toc_depth: 2
```

---

### What **not** to do

* ❌ Don’t rely only on hiding sections — spacing is the real culprit.
* ❌ Don’t deeply nest nav levels — MkDocs becomes visually noisy fast.

---

### “Goldilocks” combo
Recommended 

For most documentation-heavy sites (like yours):

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.sections
    - navigation.tracking

extra_css:
  - stylesheets/extra.css
```

With the CSS from Option 1 + a slight font-size reduction.

---

If you want, paste:

* your **current `mkdocs.yml`**, and
* a **screenshot description** (e.g. “20 items visible, scroll starts halfway down”)

…and I’ll tune the CSS *exactly* to your layout so it feels tight but not cramped.

---

### Fixing "Hero"

Ahhh — *there* it is. Yes, this explains **everything**, and you’re not doing anything wrong. Your nav isn’t just “tall”… it’s being **pushed down by a deliberate hero-style fixed header**.

Let me explain what’s happening, then give you **three clean, controlled fixes**, depending on what you want visually.

---

### What your `custom.css`
is doing (the root cause)

From your file:

```css
:root { --hero-h: 180px; }
...
.md-header {
  position: fixed;
}
...
.md-main {
  margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px);
}
```

This means:

* You’ve created a **fixed, 180px-tall header banner** (with an image).
* Because it’s `position: fixed`, the entire site content (including the left nav) is pushed **down by 180px**.
* That **reduces the vertical viewport available** for the nav.
* So even if you shrink nav padding, it still *looks* tall because it starts lower on the page.

👉 This is *not* a MkDocs nav issue — it’s a **layout tradeoff introduced by the hero header**.

---

### Your options (pick one)


---
1) — Reduce the hero height (recommended)

This keeps your design but immediately fixes nav usability.

#### Change:

```css
:root { --hero-h: 180px; }
```

#### To something like:

```css
:root { --hero-h: 120px; }   /* or even 100px */
```

And match mobile too:

```css
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  :root { --hero-h: 100px; }
}
```

✅ Result:

* Left nav starts ~60px higher.
* No structural changes.
* Best balance of aesthetics + usability.


---
2) — Make the header *non-fixed*

If you don’t absolutely need the header to stay visible while scrolling:

#### Change:

```css
.md-header {
  position: fixed;
}
```

#### To:

```css
.md-header {
  position: relative;
}
```

And **remove or comment out**:

```css
.md-main {
  margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px);
}
```

✅ Result:

* Nav uses full viewport height.
* Header scrolls away naturally.
* Much calmer, more “documentation-first” feel.


---
3) — Keep the hero, but let the nav overlap it (advanced)

This is the most “designed” solution.

Add:

```css
.md-sidebar--primary {
  top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 0.5rem);
  height: calc(100vh - var(--hero-h));
}
```

This tells MkDocs:

* “Yes, header is tall… but nav gets its own vertical budget.”

⚠️ Slightly more fragile across theme updates, but elegant when tuned.

---

### Recommended combination
for *your* site

Given your content-heavy pages:

```css
:root { --hero-h: 120px; }

.md-nav__item {
  padding-top: 0.15rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.15rem;
}

.md-nav__link {
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

This keeps:

* Your beautiful header
* Comfortable nav density
* No fighting with Material’s layout engine

---

### Why this felt “mysterious”

You correctly tuned the nav… but the **viewport was being eaten from above**, not inside the nav itself. Once you know that, everything makes sense.

If you want, next we can:

* Make the header **only appear on the homepage**, or
* Animate it shrinking on scroll, or
* Give the nav a subtle background to visually separate it from the hero

Just say the word.

### Image Disappeared

Good catch — and no, you don’t need to *resize the image itself*. What’s happened is almost certainly **CSS-related**, not the asset.

Given what you changed earlier (hero height / positioning), there are **three very common reasons** the hero image “disappears” in Material + custom CSS setups like yours.

Let’s walk through them in order of likelihood.


---
1️⃣ The hero container still exists, but now has **zero height**

This is the most common cause.

Your CSS likely has something like:

```css
:root { --hero-h: 180px; }

.hero {
  height: var(--hero-h);
  background-image: url("...");
}
```

If:

* `--hero-h` was removed, misspelled, or overridden in a media query, or
* `.md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px); }` was removed **but the hero still relies on it**

→ the hero collapses to 0px tall, so the image “vanishes”.

### ✅ Fix 1

Make the height explicit again:

```css
.hero {
  min-height: var(--hero-h);
}
```

Or hard-test it with:

```css
.hero {
  min-height: 120px;
}
```

If it reappears → we’ve confirmed the cause.


---
2️⃣ The image path is now wrong relative to MkDocs

MkDocs **rewrites paths** depending on where CSS lives.

If your CSS is in:

```
docs/stylesheets/custom.css
```

Then the image path must be relative to **that file**, not the page:

❌ Wrong (common mistake):

```css
background-image: url("images/banner.jpg");
```

✅ Correct (example):

```css
background-image: url("../images/banner.jpg");
```

📁 Typical layout:

```
docs/
  images/
    hero.jpg
  stylesheets/
    custom.css
```

If you moved CSS files recently, the relative path would silently break.


---
3️⃣ The header is now behind something (z-index issue)

When switching between `position: fixed` and `relative`, stacking order can change.

### ✅ Fix 2

Add a defensive z-index:

```css
.md-header {
  z-index: 10;
}
.hero {
  z-index: 5;
}
```

This ensures the hero renders *above* the main content but *below* nav overlays.

---

### Quick diagnostic (2 minutes)

Add this temporarily:

```css
.hero {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

* If you see a red bar → image path or sizing issue.
* If you see nothing → height / positioning issue.
* If it flashes then vanishes → z-index / fixed header interaction.

Remove once diagnosed.

---

### TL;DR

* ❌ You do **not** need to resize the image.
* ✅ The hero container likely lost height or its image URL broke.
* ✅ Fix height first, then confirm relative path.

If you paste the **exact CSS block** where the hero image is defined (the `background-image` rule), I’ll pinpoint it instantly and give you the exact corrected snippet.

---

Oh Robyn — you haven’t “stuffed it up” at all. You’ve actually got 95% of this right. The image disappearing is almost certainly due to **one of two small issues in your CSS** (and both are easy fixes).

I’ve looked through what you uploaded. 

### The two biggest culprits


---
1) Your mobile margin-top is wrong (it’s subtracting 84px)

At the bottom you have:

```css
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  :root { --hero-h: 110px; }
  .md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) - 84px); }
}
```

That means on mobile you’re pushing the main content down by only **26px** (110–84), so the header can overlap and make things look “gone” or broken.

**Fix:** make it consistent with desktop:

```css
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  :root { --hero-h: 110px; }
  .md-header .md-header__title { font-size: 1.8rem; }
  .md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px); }
}
```


---
2) Your image path might be wrong (most common)

You’ve got:

```css
background: url("../images/header-bg.jpg") center/cover no-repeat;
```

This is correct **only if** your folder structure is:

```
docs/
  stylesheets/
    custom.css
  images/
    header-bg.jpg
```

If your image is actually somewhere else (e.g. `docs/assets/images/`), it’ll silently fail.

**Quick test:** open your built site folder and see where the image ends up:

* `site/images/header-bg.jpg` should exist after `mkdocs build`.

If it doesn’t, the path is wrong or the image isn’t inside `docs/`.

---

### One more thing:
you still have the diagnostic red bar enabled

You currently have:

```css
.hero {
  background-color: red !important;
}
```

That was the “diagnostic” we discussed. It won’t kill the header image (since your header uses `.md-header`), but it can add confusion. You can remove it now.

Also you have `.hero { min-height: var(--hero-h); }` but you don’t appear to be using a `.hero` element at all — it’s harmless but unnecessary.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### A clean, corrected version
you can paste in

Below is your CSS with only the essential fixes, keeping your header exactly as intended:

```css
/* ===== Tall sticky header with background image ===== */
:root { --hero-h: 140px; }   /* visual height of your banner */

.md-nav__item {
  padding-top: 0.15rem;
  padding-bottom: 0.15rem;
}

.md-nav__link {
  line-height: 1.2;
}

/* Import fonts from Google Fonts */
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Great+Vibes&family=Libre+Franklin:wght@400&display=swap');

/* Site title styling */
.md-header .md-header__title {
  font-family: 'Great Vibes', cursive;
  font-size: 2.2rem;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #11f !important;
  text-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,.55);
  letter-spacing: 0;
  line-height: 1.3;
}

/* Nav links styling */
.md-header-nav__link {
  font-family: 'Libre Franklin', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1rem;
  color: #f8f8f8 !important;
  text-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.35);
}

.md-header-nav__link:hover {
  color: #ffd6e8 !important;
}

/* Header background and overlay */
.md-header {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
  z-index: 20;
  background: url("../images/header-bg.jpg") center/cover no-repeat;
}

/* Make header taller and align the nav/title at the bottom */
.md-header__inner {
  min-height: var(--hero-h);
  align-items: flex-end;
  padding-bottom: .75rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Compensate main content so it doesn't slide under the fixed header */
.md-main {
  margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px);
}

/* Keep the gradient overlay working */
.md-header::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute; inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(0,0,0,0) 40%, rgba(0,0,0,.35) 100%);
  pointer-events: none;
}

/* Theme-aware text colors (optional) */
[data-md-color-scheme="default"] .md-header .md-header__title { color: #ff9 !important; }
[data-md-color-scheme="slate"]   .md-header .md-header__title { color: #ff9 !important; }
[data-md-color-scheme="slate"]   .md-header-nav__link         { color: #f0f0f0 !important; }

/* Mobile adjustments */
@media (max-width: 720px) {
  :root { --hero-h: 110px; }
  .md-header .md-header__title { font-size: 1.8rem; }
  .md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px); }
}
```

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### If the image
still doesn’t show after this…

Then it’s 99% the file path. Do this quick check:

1. Ensure `header-bg.jpg` is inside **`docs/images/`** (not elsewhere).
2. Run `mkdocs build` locally.
3. Confirm the built file exists here:

   * `site/images/header-bg.jpg`

If it’s missing, MkDocs isn’t copying it because it isn’t under `docs/`.

---

If you tell me where `header-bg.jpg` lives in your project tree (just the folder path), I’ll give you the exact `url(...)` that will work first time.

<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;color:blue;background-color:blue">

### Final Fix

[Q]  
That image lives in assets/images, just like in the url. When I pass my mouse cursor over the link, a miniature image shows up. I didn't change the path. The only thing different from usual is that my css files live in docs/assets/css instead of docs/stylesheets. So, I changed that in mkdocs.yml and moved it and voilà: works now!

---

[Emily]  
That makes perfect sense — and you diagnosed it exactly right. 👍

What bit you is **relative paths in CSS**:

* Your header uses `background: url("../images/header-bg.jpg") …` 
* That path is resolved **relative to where the CSS file ends up in the built site**, not relative to the page.

So when you moved the CSS from:

* `docs/stylesheets/custom.css` → built as `site/stylesheets/custom.css`

to:

* `docs/assets/css/custom.css` → built as `site/assets/css/custom.css`

…the `../images/` part started pointing to a *different* place. If your image is at `docs/assets/images/header-bg.jpg` (→ `site/assets/images/header-bg.jpg`), then the correct relative path from `site/assets/css/` to `site/assets/images/` is:

```css
background: url("../images/header-bg.jpg") center/cover no-repeat;
```

Exactly what you already had — but it only works once the CSS lives under `assets/css/` (because now `../images/` resolves to `assets/images/`). ✅

Two small follow-ups (optional, but helpful):

1. **Remove the diagnostic red bar**
   You still have:

```css
.hero { background-color: red !important; }
```

That was just for testing; it can confuse things later. 

2. **Fix the mobile margin-top**
   Your mobile rule currently subtracts 84px:

```css
.md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) - 84px); }
```

That can cause overlap on small screens. Consider:

```css
.md-main { margin-top: calc(var(--hero-h) + 4px); }
```
