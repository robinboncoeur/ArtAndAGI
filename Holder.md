Sure thing, Robyn 😊 Here’s a short carry-over summary you can paste into the next thread:

**Context summary (Scenes 36–37 + recent ComfyUI/Qwen notes)**

* We drafted a long new scene initially combining **Coffee With Sarah** + **after Sarah leaves** romance, and identified the structural problem: two distinct emotional arcs were being mashed together.

* Decision: split into **Scene 36** and **Scene 37**.

  * **Scene 36 (“Coffee, Then Shade”)**: Heatwave Sunday; café + tram + Celeste’s home as refuge. Sarah witnesses Charli’s “home self,” and explicitly reveals Wardrobe’s women quietly protected Charli’s pronouns/space *without making her the stage* (“watched vs witnessed”). We firmed the prose: tightened opening philosophy, removed repetition, corrected typos, trimmed description density, and ended the scene on the strongest chord: **“I don’t have to be careful here.” / “That is the entire point.”**
  * **Scene 37 (“After the Door Clicks”)**: private aftermath once Sarah leaves. Charli admits she felt “under a microscope”; Celeste reframes it as being *witnessed*, reassures that “home-self doesn’t endanger work-self,” and their intimacy begins safely—anchoring, consent-forward, non-performative. Key line: Charli’s overwhelmed **“You want… me?”** and Celeste’s answer (“Yes… and you’re still free”). Romance is separated from the “women’s competence net” beat to keep both arcs clean and resonant.

* Next up: you’re working on **Scene 36/37 onward** (Coffee with Sarah, lunch/heatwave, aftermath), planning another firming pass; guardrail remains: **stay in Wardrobe’s lane** (competence, safety, consent, consequences, no spectacle).
