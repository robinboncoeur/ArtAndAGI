David Hamilton style photo of two young women sharing a tender kiss while sitting closely together on a cozy, gray leather sofa in an intimate living room setting. 

The taller woman on the left has dark-brown hair loosely tied up in a messy updo, wearing a white satin shell top paired with high-waisted, close-fitted grey linen trousers. The shorter woman on the right has wavy light-brown hair in a neat high ponytail and wears a soft, light pink cap-sleeve top and dark blue form-fitting skinny jeans. 

They are holding hands between them, and the taller woman has her other arm wrapped around the shorter woman's shoulder. A paisley-patterned, fringed black and beige throw blanket covers their laps. 

The room is warmly lit by the soft, diffused glow of the evening setting sun through a window in the left throwing light patterns on a dark wooden bookshelf filled with books and small framed pictures on the right. From the large window a breeze blows a sheer curtain in their direction. 

The overall mood is romantic, peaceful, and very cozy. The foreground features a dark wooden coffee table with a picture book of places to travel yo and a small vase with petunias. Particles of magical, soft, glowing light dust float gently in the air throughout the scene. Soft focus, high detail, warm color palette.

Scene 2 comments

---
Yes, absolutely — I’d be delighted to translate your first five scenes into Italian with the same **Celeste-voice** approach we used for Scene 1: crisp authority, calibrated warmth, zero clinical vibe, and that “I steer reality” cadence. 😊🇮🇹✨

And no, you don’t need to change anything about your process: just paste each scene (like you’ve done here), and I’ll translate it in that house style. We’ll also keep building the **Italian voice bible + glossary** as we go, so Scene 50+ stays consistent.

For now, here’s this scene in Italian (I’m keeping your rhythm and power beats, and I’m keeping the “boardroom” clarity inside teen language).

### Piccole scelte “canone IT” (così restiamo coerenti nelle Scene 2–5)

* *held-back boy* → **ragazzo bocciato** / **ripetente** (ho usato “bocciato” perché ha più taglio sociale, più duro)
* *Power is best used…* → **Il potere si usa meglio…** (pulito, Celeste)
* *misallocated* → **mal collocato** (molto Celeste: tecnico/manageriale, non pietistico)
* *I don’t do charity. I do investment.* → **Io non faccio beneficenza. Io faccio investimenti.** (dritto, memorabile)

Se ti va, quando mi incolli **Scene 2**, iniziamo anche un **glossario IT** (10–20 voci) e lo aggiorniamo automaticamente ad ogni scena. 😊



Scene 3 Comments



Yes. And Scene 03 is **deliciously** Wardrobe: competence-as-morality, women’s standards as structure, men’s “taking up space” as a low-grade pollutant, and Celeste learning to *choose the angle of truth* instead of performing empathy. 😌🧵✨

One practical note before the Italian: this “Scene 03” is **long and composite** (atelier + Graham + maintenance yard + Celeste/Charlie doorway-choice). That’s not a problem — it’s just a lot of text for one paste, so I’m going to translate it **faithfully and smoothly**, keeping the same *house style* we’ve established (sharp, modern Italian with a slightly literary cadence). I’ll also keep recurring choices consistent with what we’ve already set:

* **Wardrobe** stays *Wardrobe* (proper noun, brand, domain)
* *trial shift* → **giornata di prova** / **turno di prova** (I’ll use *giornata* because Mara frames it as “one day”)
* *Good girl* → **Brava ragazza** (tool-language, appraisal, not flirt)
* Celeste voice: clipped authority, calibrated warmth
* Mara voice: blunt, preventative maintenance, no speeches

Here we go. 🇮🇹

## **Scene 03 — Wardrobe (IT)**

---

### Canon IT — nuovi tasselli per glossario 📌

* *preventative maintenance* (gentilezza Mara) → **manutenzione preventiva**
* *I don’t take strays. I take workers.* → **Non prendo randagi. Prendo lavoratori.**
* *not a lifeline. a lane* → **non un salvagente. una corsia.**
* *dignity negotiable* → **la dignità negoziabile**
* *engineering disguised as femininity* → **ingegneria travestita da femminilità**

---

Se vuoi, per mantenere questo sostenibile mentre traduci le prime 5 scene, possiamo fare così:
✅ tu incolli una scena per volta (come ora)
✅ io traduco + aggiorno 5–10 voci di glossario per scena
✅ entro Scene 5 avremo un **mini “Voice Bible IT”** stabile (Celeste/Mara/Sarah/Lauren) pronto per Scene 50+. 😊




Absolutely — Scene 04 is *peak* Wardrobe: standards as safety, structure as oxygen, Celeste learning restraint, and Mara’s competence as moral law. 🧵🔥🇮🇹

Here’s the Italian translation in the same house style (clean, modern, slightly literary, with the “women’s authority is normal gravity” tone):

---

**Scene 04 —  (IT)**

---

If you paste **Scene 05**, we’ll have our five for today ✅ and then I can also give you (in one tidy block) the **Italian micro-glossary** we’ve accumulated across Scenes 1–4 so you can keep style consistent when you revisit/extend. 😊






Scene 5

My pleasure, Robyn 🫶🇮🇹✨ And thank you for this one — Scene 05 is *so* clean in its ethics: no “rescue,” only doors; no softness that becomes loophole; women’s structure as the safety net **and** the standard.

Here’s the Italian translation in the same voice approach:

---

## **Scene 05 — “” (IT)**






If you’d like, I can now paste a **compact Italian voice bible + micro-glossary** from Scenes 1–5 (Wardrobe terms, Mara-isms, recurring “rules/permission” beats), so when you continue later the tone stays *locked* ✅
